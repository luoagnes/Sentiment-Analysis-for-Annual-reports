prospects recent global economic environment has seen challenges mainly due to the downgrade of sovereign rating of the us by a rating agency and the debt problems in the euro zone, that have affected market sentiment in the short- term. the agreement among the policymakers in the us to raise the statutory debt ceiling, and the objective to accomplish a more conservative fiscal policy have relieved market concerns on the financial position of the us government. in europe, the debt problems will lead to structural economic and social reforms in the affected countries and restore financial stability in the region. the global economic recovery is expected to continue despite recent volatilities in the market.
china s economic growth is expected to remain steady as a result of positive fundamentals notwithstanding central government s monetary tightening efforts and measures as they should be helpful to sustain economic expansion over the medium and long-term. the twelfth five-year plan, which aims at setting out the directions for a sustainable economic development, will take chinese economy to a new level. in particular, the plan to impel the new round of western development with chengdu and chongqing being the focus of such policy will create additional business opportunities benefiting sino land as it has one sizable property development in each of the cities. the housing measures are integral part of the housing reform and social policy in mainland china that are important to establish a healthy and resilient property market environment. the plan, together with its policies and measures, will provide good support for future economic development of the hong kong property market is going through a period of changes that are important to establish a more sustainable framework of a healthy property market. they broadly cover the needs of different income groups.
the home-buyer protection measures introduced in mid-2010 has increased transparency in property transactions. the housing measures stated in the policy address in october 2010 help maintain a good balance in demand and supply. the implementation of additional stamp duties and lowering of the loan-to-value ratios in november 2010 help reduce excessive speculative home purchase activity and ensure a healthy mortgage lending business. the housing measures including the introduction of government-initiated land auctions and tender and my home purchase plan in the 2011-12 budget announced in february 2011 set out a more broad based housing policy to stabilise residential property prices. and the most recently, further restrictions on loan-to-value ratios as credit control management is an extension of previous one implemented earlier on in november 2010. these measures will forestall potential risks in property and banking sectors, helping to build strong economic fundamentals. hong kong property market has shown consolidation in the past few months reflecting the impact of the measures by the hksar government to stabilize the property prices and external factors in the us and euro zone, nevertheless, the market outlook is positive for the medium and long-term.
