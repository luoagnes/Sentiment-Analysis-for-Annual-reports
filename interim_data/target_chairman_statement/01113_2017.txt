several unexpected events occurred in 2016 that reshaped the global political and economic landscape.
the repercussions of brexit, rising u.s. interest rates and the depreciation of various currencies against the u.s. dollar have given rise to an uncertain and difficult economic environment.
cheung kong property holdings limited (the group) continues to follow a prudent and disciplined approach to development amid the challenges of a constantly changing marketplace. all of its property businesses recorded steady progress, with a solid overall performance achieved for the year.
meanwhile, the group has pursued global investment opportunities in line with the criteria set out in the 2015 annual report, and consistent with its strategy to broaden its growth prospects through diversification and globalisation. since late 2016, our footprint is poised to extend to the energy infrastructure and aircraft leasing areas to enhance our recurring revenue streams and mitigate the cyclical nature of cash flows associated with property development.
the groups overall results for the year were in line with expectations. for the year ended 31 december 2016, the groups audited profit attributable to shareholders was hk$19,415 million, 13% higher than last year. profit before investment property revaluation was hk$18,032 million, an increase of 16% compared with 2015. an increase in fair value of investment properties of hk$1,383 million after tax was recorded.

all of the groups property businesses are progressing steadily according to our schedules, with solid performances achieved in 2016: 
the property market in hong kong generally remained stable although buyers sentiment was affected by the government measures to stabilise the market in late 2016, and the advent of the u.s. interest rate upcycle. on the mainland, new measures were introduced in the fourth quarter last year to regulate and moderate growth in property sales, construction and investment. the groups property sales in 2016 comprised mainly projects in hong kong and the mainland. contribution for the year was in line with our expectations. looking to 2017, property projects in hong kong and the mainland will remain our major focus for marketing and sales.

the local retail market continues to consolidate with retail turnover continuing to decrease, albeit at a slower rate in recent months. despite the downward pressure on retail rentals amid the prevailing difficult market conditions, the groups contribution from property rental increased when compared with last year, largely attributable to the expansion of the groups investment property portfolio, and the steady rental contribution from its premium commercial properties. to further strengthen its recurring revenue base, the group will continue to optimise and enhance its investment property portfolio through investments in high quality projects with stable rental returns.
hotel and serviced suite operation
visitor arrivals to hong kong increased in december last year, ending the successive declines in the preceding five quarters. the number of mainland visitors also appeared to have stabilised. however, the average achieved hotel room rate in 2016 was lower than 2015. inevitably, the groups hotel operation was affected by the prevailing market conditions while the serviced suite operation remained relatively resilient. contribution increased moderately in 2016 as a whole. as part of the policies to enhance its quality streams of recurring revenue, the group will continue to strengthen its hotel and serviced suite portfolio, and increase its competitiveness by enhancing operational efficiency and brand positioning to release the underlying portfolio value in a timely manner.
property and project management
the group continued to strengthen its property and project management business to support its development and investment properties. an increase in turnover and contribution was registered as compared with the previous year. the total floor area of properties under the groups property management is expected to increase following the completion of various developments.
new business ventures
driven by the strategic objective to generate stable, quality returns for shareholders through diversification and globalisation, the group is poised to expand into new business sectors. since late 2016, suitable investment opportunities have arisen: on 14 march 2017, the necessary independent shareholders approval was obtained by each of the group, cheung kong infrastructure holdings limited and power assets holdings limited for the formation of a consortium which is held as to 40%, 40% and 20% respectively by each of them to acquire 100% of the stapled securities in issue of the duet group which are listed on the australian securities exchange at an offer price of aud3.00 per share. however, completion of the acquisition is still subject to the approval of duet groups securityholders and other governmental approvals. the group has adequate financial resources to satisfy the required financial commitment.
the duet group is an owner and operator of energy utility assets in australia, the united states, the united kingdom and europe, and represents an attractive investment opportunity with good 
in december 2016, the group purchased from ck hutchison holdings limited the equity interests in ck capital limited and harrier global limited, companies engaged in the aircraft leasing business. the acquisition was completed on 15 december 2016 at the adjusted total consideration of approximately us$988 million (equivalent to approximately hk$7,690 million). we plan to expand the aircraft leasing business as part of our strategy to broaden our growth prospects through diversification and globalisation, and to generate steady cash flows and predictable returns on a medium to long term 
2017 is expected to be a year of evolving global political and economic developments. uncertainties may result following the change of the u.s. government in january this year and a series of government elections across europe and asia. the brexit process and the u.s. interest rate increases will also be the focal points of the market. the global economy is likely to stay on a slow growth trajectory in the year to come.
chinas gdp growth in 2016 was in line with expectations with the support of growth stabilising policies. the growth is especially impressive when viewed against the prevailing difficult global economic environment. policies targeted at deflating asset bubbles and forestalling potential risks will continue to deepen supply-side structural reform and boost the real economy. china is expected to sustain a healthy and steady economic development over the longer term.
hong kong is under challenges from the complex and volatile external environment. the local property market is likely to remain stable given the relatively solid economic fundamentals, and the pent-up demand for properties. government housing policies will continue to be a determining factor for the property market both in hong kong and on the mainland.
the group is well positioned to diversify globally by building on its strong financial strength, with ample liquidity and a low debt ratio. as guided by the principle to advance while maintaining stability, we continue to pursue quality investments worldwide with stable recurring revenue, such as infrastructure investment, property investment, and aircraft leasing. it enables us to secure recurring revenue streams in the near term, achieve long-term sustainable business growth, and maximise value for all shareholders. 2017 will be characterised by significant political and economic challenges.
the group will continue to respond to evolving market trends with prudence and adaptability, and with creativity and innovation. we will pursue business and geographic expansion to generate the best returns for shareholders by leveraging on our sound fundamentals and strong financials, and by adhering to a cautious development principle. the group is reasonably confident in meeting its profitability target for 2017 despite a complex and volatile global political and economic environment.
intelligent, creative, dedicated, experienced and loyal employees are the groups most valuable asset in this extremely competitive and challenging global environment. we take this opportunity to thank our colleagues on the board and our diligent employees for their hard work, loyal service and contributions during the year.
