numerous market trends are presenting expansion opportunities within our core business such as increased demand for fuel efficiency, vehicle connectivity, driver assist and autonomous vehicle technologies. the very essence of how the market defines mobility is evolving and shaping nexteer s research and development activities.
the nexteer team is leveraging our driver assistance products and technology to enhance the autonomous driving experience using both conventional product development and disruptive thinking. our steer-by- wire production history and ongoing research and development are central building blocks to meeting this objective. this effort resulted in the booking of our first development contract on an autonomous vehicle with a north american vehicle manufacturer.
as a leader in intuitive motion control, we believe that focusing on current success is not sufficient to maximise the growth potential of the enterprise.
with this in mind, we are approaching the market as an entrepreneurial and innovative organisation. we have made strategic investments adjacent to our core business to expand our diversification efforts.

taking lessons learned from silicon valley, we launched a business and technology development group (syntecrity). this team operates independent of our traditional r&d organisation and maintains focus on the quick indentification and advancement of new portfolio products and functional capabilities for next generation global mega trends are also creating growth opportunities in areas outside of traditional automotive. we have established a separate business development group to explore the application of existing products and core competencies in adjacent markets.
along with growth opportunities on the horizon for 2016 and beyond, nexteer will continue to monitor the needs of global markets and look for favorable opportunities within the domain of intuitive motion control. through responsible stewardship of core competencies and deliberate pursuit of commercial opportunities, we intend to ensure long-term success of the company.
i am proud of what we have accomplished in our journey to transform nexteer into an agile, lean and independent global company. with a robust long term strategy and a strong balance sheet, nexteer is poised for sustainable profitable growth.

on behalf of the board, i would like to express my sincere appreciation to our management team and our over 12,000 employees worldwide for their unwavering dedication in making nexteer a leader in intuitive motion control. i extend additional thanks to our shareholders.
your belief and support afford nexteer the ability to thrive in a dynamic global marketplace and to build a solid platform for continued growth.
i encourage you to review the material contained in this report, and sincerely value your continued support of march 15, 2016
