hong kong investment properties the group's gross rental income recorded a satisfactory increase of 16% from hk$552 million in year 2000 to hk$639 million in year 2001, amidst the worsening business environment in hong kong which was exacerbated by the september 11th attack. even though the overall rate of office rental experienced a slight downward adjustment due to a soft rental market, the group has recorded an improvement in the overall occupancy to 95% for its major investment portfolio, which is mainly due to up- surges in new lettings of smaller retail shops and in lease renewals.
the group's flexible offer of incentives to new retailers and tenants, and its innovative leasing strategy also contributed to last year's improvement in this respect.
rental role from the group's massmutual tower, windsor house and harcourt house continued to generate steady income for the group of hk$79 million, hk$92 million and hk$68 million in 2001 respectively. major tenants of these core investment properties had renewed their leases in 2001. the occupancy rate of windsor house office space recorded an improvement from 90.02% to 96.07%. however, there were slight decline in occupancy rate for the year 2001 from 98.73% to 98.38% for massmutual tower, and 93.73% to 91.61% for harcourt house.
the drop may be due to downsizing of office space by some tenants upon renewal, and surrendering of leases by several tenants upon expiry of leases. office rental was still under a downward pressure in 2001 due to the shrinking demand and increasing vacancies. the same phenomenon has been experienced by landlords throughout the central, admiralty and the group's retail portfolio in causeway bay, wanchai, tsim sha tsui and mong kok continued to provide significant income to the group. the shops in excelsior plaza were fully let and that generated a gross rental income of hk$44 million in 2001. the occupancy rate of the retailing spaces of windsor house was 96.18% with an annual income of hk$162 million in 2001. after the first and second floors of hong kong mansion renovated into a modern shopping arcade called causeway place with 179 retailing spaces, the said property achieved an occupancy rate of 83.22% contributing hk$61 million in 2001. the group now holds an investment portfolio of over 499,000 square feet of prominent retail space in causeway bay, comprising the excelsior plaza, the windsor house and causeway place, plus a gross floor area of approximately 407,000 square feet of grade a office space in windsor house. the wanchai computer centre generated hk$45 million in 2001 for the group with an occupancy rate of 98%. by strengthening the trade mix of new tenants and relocating some of the existing tenants, the occupancy rate of silvercord increased from 80.24% in june 2001 to 94.71% by end of 2001. the basement of silvercord of 19,466 square feet was converted to a food court with a wide range of local and foreign foods. as for chic castle, the landlord's aggressive leasing strategy proved successful as the occupancy rate jumped from 69.18% in june 2001 to 94.08% in december 2001. the newly acquired yuen long new place at golden hall building in yuen long also achieved an improved occupancy rate of 68% by the end of year 2001.

privatisation of evergo china in view of the thin trading volume of the shares of evergo china and the substantial discount of the trading prices to its net asset value, the company, at that time having a 46.62% direct interest in evergo china, proposed to evergo china's shareholders (other than the group) in august 2001 to privatise evergo china by way of a scheme of arrangement in august 2001. the scheme was approved by the scheme shareholders and the court of bermuda, and became effective in november 2001. since then, evergo china has become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company. under the scheme, the company has allotted 1,062,670 new shares of the company to the scheme shareholders of evergo china who elected share alternative on the basis of 123 shares of the company for every 1,000 shares of evergo china, and has made cash payment of approximately hk$206 million to the scheme shareholders of evergo china who elected cash alternative on the basis of hk$0.18 in cash for each share of evergo convertible bonds due 2003 in march 2001, the company issued hk$200 million 3% convertible bonds (the bonds ) due 2003 as part of the consideration for acquiring 32,118 square feet of retailing space of excelsior plaza in causeway bay. instead of issuing new shares at a substantial discount with dilution effects on the consolidated net asset value per share, the company redeemed the bonds in cash in september 2001.

last year, the emerging signs of economic recovery in the first half of the year were quickly shattered and driven down by the global economic downturn by the september 11th attack in the united states. after eleven interest rate cuts and aggressive measures to stimulate economic recovery led by the united states, recent releases of economic figures showed a gradual recovery of economy in the united states and major european countries.
even though hong kong's domestic demand remains weak, hong kong has become more cost competitive than before in term of wages and rents after the deflationary adjustment in the past few years. barring adverse global circumstance, such as the worrisome global political and economic developments, hong kong's economic improvement should appear again later this year or early next year, following the anticipated recovery of the united states economy and the low interest environment.
in the prc, the positive news relating to mainland china's entry to world trade organisation and the hosting of the 2008 olympic games has stimulated increases of business opportunities and surges in economic activities. the demands for office space and housing have been significantly improving. in the coming years, the group would consider to increase its involvement in the prc property development activities either of its own or with joint venture partner in the prevailing major cities of mainland china, especially in beijing, shanghai and guangzhou.
in hong kong, the once high property prices are now reduced to an affordable level. rental yield are now more attractive to investors. the group has confidence that its persistent strive for enhancing its quality and intrinsic value can enable it to face the challenging global economic environment and to better position itself for the next cyclical upswing. thus we continue our effort to emphasize on the improvement on value of its property portfolio for a better return to shareholders.

i take this opportunity to thank our shareholders, my fellow directors and our staff for their dedication and support.
