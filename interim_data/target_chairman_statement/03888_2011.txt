chairman s statement 2010 was the year of change for kingsoft. we have recently completed restructuring of kingsoft internet security and are in the midst of restructuring our online games r&d studios in order to turn ourselves into leaner and nimbler, and more self-motivated organisations. meanwhile, we have also introduced internet-oriented top talents to our management team.

entertainment software business review kingsoft game has been primarily engaging in research, development and operation of online games of chinese mythology and martial arts genre. as no new game title was released in 2010, the entertainment software business recorded a decrease of 6% in revenue year-on-year. since the introduction of a group of talents of game operation in 2009, we signifi cantly improved game operation effi ciency and recorded a reduced attenuation rate of games in 2010. to better motivate game research talents, we have announced restructuring of our westhouse studios by having key persons of the studios acquire 20% interest of the westhouse studios.

looking ahead in 2011, kingsoft has fi ve new games in pipeline, compared to no new game title in 2010, which are legend of moon (gq_p), rush team (q@0b), cangqiongzhinu (yzkn) and other two titles. in 2011, our game business will also explore opportunities into producing advanced casual games and casual games on mobile tablet devices.
the launch of our free kingsoft internet security simplifi ed chinese personal edition will help us capture a larger user base and further enhance user experience by incorporating a number of value-added-services. with increasingly better copyright protection in china and growth prospective overseas, wps offi ce is well positioned for a new round of sustainable growth both in china and overseas.
