i also hope that investors will acknowledge our results and render continuous support to the business development strategy of the for the year ended 31 december 2015, the group achieved outstanding growth in sales revenue and operating results. total sales for the year amounted to approximately rmb12,639,332,000, representing an increase of 13.5% when compared to 2014. the profit attributable to the equity holders of the company for the year ended 31 december 2015 amounted to rmb2,354,664,000, representing an increase of 14.0% as compared to rmb2,065,867,000 reported for the year ended 31 december 2014. earnings per share amounted to rmb1.68. as of 31 december 2015, the group had cash and cash equivalents of in view of the promising business performance and the healthy financial position of the group, the board of the company recommends the payment of a final dividend of hk$1.07 per share (including a special dividend of hk$0.35 per share), equivalent to approximately rmb0.90 per share.
according to the statistics compiled by china customs, the total export value of china s textile and garment products (including textile yarns, fabrics and related products, as well as garments and apparel accessories, similarly hereinafter) for 2015 was us$283.85 billion, representing a decrease of approximately 4.9% over the previous year. out of the total export value, the export value of textile products amounted to us$109.52 billion, representing a year-on- year decrease of approximately 2.3%; the garment export volume dropped by approximately 6.4% to us$174.33 billion on a year-on- year basis. among the major textile and garment export markets, the export volume to the u.s. have increased year-on-year by 6.7% while the export volume to the eu and japan dropped year-on-year by 9.4% and 11.7% respectively. the proportion of china s garment products to the total import volume of their respective markets kept diminishing. upon the official implementation of the trans-pacific partnership agreement (the tpp ), the u.s. market for china s textile and garment products will be adversely affected.

in 2015, the garment industry in china was under suppressed conditions as a whole. given the ageing population, the size of labour force in china showed a descending trend for years. after years of rapid development, labour costs and prices of raw materials were significantly higher than those of other garment manufacturing nations. the exchange rate of renminbi against u.s. dollar recorded a moderate depreciation during the year. however, the cumulative appreciation in the exchange rate between renminbi and other major currencies, including u.s. dollars, euro and japanese yen, recorded since the reform of renminbi exchange rate mechanism launched in 2005 is still high relatively. eu and japan have not exhibited explicit signs of economic recovery up till now. in order to address the environmental issues mounted up from the rapid development for decades, especially the impact of air and water pollution on the life quality of people in china, the government of china tightened the regulatory framework and policies in this respect, thereby pushing up the related costs incurred by corporations. thanks to the lowered demand and the substantial price drop of crude oil, the prices of our raw materials, namely cotton yarn and chemical fibre, were at their historical low, thus alleviating the pressure arising from surging costs of the industry to a certain extent.
in response to the economic downturn, the government of china ramped up its support to the real economy by streamlining the administrative approval procedures, speeding up the grant of approvals, adjusting the taxation policy to alleviate tax burdens of corporations in an effective way, encouraging competitive corporations to establish production plants and invest in foreign countries and taking an active role in inducing and assisting corporations in innovative transformation. in 2015, the central bank of china cut the deposit and lending rates and the reserve requirement ratio for 5 times, thus implying an easier monetary the demand in the global market was far from satisfactory, but the growth of vietnam s garment export trended upward still.
according to statistics of the vietnam customs, vietnam s textile and garment export (excluding textile yarns) for 2015 amounted to about us$22.81 billion, representing an increase of about 9.1% as compared to last year; of which exports to the u.s. amounted to approximately us$10.96 billion, representing a year-on-year increase of about 11.6%. upon the official implementation of the tpp, products from vietnam will be much more competitive in the u.s. market. according to statistics of china customs, fabrics exported to vietnam from china in 2015 amounted to us$8.16 billion approximately, representing an increase of about 14.6%. since garment products made in vietnam still rely on fabrics imported from china, corporations boasting the integrated production model will be highly competitive in vietnam. in recent years, vietnam has endeavoured to attract foreign investment, which might push up the prices of raw materials and the labour costs rapidly.
during the year, the company provided all professional committees with sufficient resources required for performing their respective duties. the board also collaborated closely with all professional committees and maintained efficient communication between those committees. all these efforts led to fruitful results. staff members of the company are committed to the highest standard of corporate governance, and are determined to build a fair and impartial decision-making process. by ensuring a high degree of transparency, the company will exert every effort to provide an open communication channel for all shareholders and investors.

i would like to express my sincere gratitude towards my fellow directors for their valuable contributions over the past year. i would also like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the management staff of all levels, as well as all the staff members for their devotion and loyalty towards the company. it is your hard work that accomplishes the group s established target for the year. i hope that all staff members will cherish our fruitful results and uphold our core value of quality always comes first by providing our clients with products of the best quality with our genuine craftsmanship against the backdrop of the challenging market conditions in the future. i would like to thank our shareholders, customers and suppliers for their long- lasting trust in the company. i hope that we will continue to gain your support in our future development! as to our operating strategy in the future, the group s sustainable development will take the top priority, and the group will step up our investment in research and development for the sake of enhancing our ability in innovation, and will also facilitate the plan of automated production and the use of information technology by applying modern technologies, thus securing a larger market share with our efficiency and service quality.
