chairman s statement in a challenging business environment, wheelock turned in a solid result for 2014 with record property sales in hong kong, a balanced landbank and stable gearing. on behalf of the board, i wish to express my gratitude to the directors and the team for their commitment and contribution to the group, and to our shareholders and partners for their continued support throughout the years.
the global political and economic landscape is ever-changing. all eyes are on interest rates, and swings in foreign exchange rates, particularly in the euro and yen, and their impact on the traditional flows. the euro zone and russia face serious challenges. in china, the leadership has a clear agenda to rebalance the economy. the slower but intended higher quality growth, forecast at 7% this year, is the new normal as urbanization and anti-graft initiatives continue.
these are all positives for the long-term, though there will be short-term challenges. on another note, the us is showing signs of recovery and there is bustling activity and development in the technology and innovation sectors.
key quantitative easing programmes from leading economies are setting the pace in curing deflationary biases in their respective economies.
global liquidity continues to put pressure on asset values in hong kong, singapore and mainland china, where government property cooling measures have impacted transaction volumes over the past few years.
despite a challenging year with a tough final quarter, the hong kong economy grew steadily by 2.9% with unemployment at 3%. the government continues to invest in infrastructure projects and is implementing its long-term land supply strategy but concerns remain over the impact of persistent property cooling measures.
and despite adjustments in commodity prices globally, local construction costs continue to rise.
