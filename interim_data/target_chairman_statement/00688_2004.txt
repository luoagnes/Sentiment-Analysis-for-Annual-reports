the board is optimistic about the future of the group. the global economy is expected to do well in year 2004.
while it takes time to resolve the structural problems for the hong kong economy, the board expects that the economy and the real estate market in hong kong will perform well in the near future. the prc economy will continue to outperform the rest of the world and maintain its rapid growth for the next few years at least. all these factors are favorable to the business operation of the group.
within the framework of strategic management, the group will endeavour to accelerate the pace of management reform and business development, to improve the consolidated strengths and competitiveness of our various business segments and to increase the return on shareholders fund to above 10%. in order that the business performance of the group can have another breakthrough, the following detailed strategies and measures are to be implemented: i. the prc property market is in the period of renovation, consolidation and reorganization. the board is of the view that the market will continue to grow while being regulated and amid various adjustments. captured on the competitive advantages of the group in financial and manpower capabilities, excellent management style and in the reputable brandname, we will continue to increase our scale of investment in the prc property market. the board is capable, confident and determined to become one of the best nationwide property developers in the prc. to achieve such target, we will a. understand correctly the needs and wants of the customers and continue to produce elite products to the satisfaction of customers at different levels and in different cities.
b. increase our land reserve at the pace of not less than 1,000,000 sq.m. gross development area for short term development. our expansion strategy is to do better and bigger in the 4 core cities (namely beijing, shanghai, guangzhou and shenzhen) and hence with the major bulk of the profit coming from these 4 cities for the next few years. at the same time, we will actively expand to cities adjoining to these 4 cities and also to strategic second-tier cities in order that we can secure big pieces of land at relatively lower price and for medium and long term development purposes. this will ensure the best scale of operation and financial benefit for the group in the short, medium and long term.
in year 2003, the group has developed 4 new points in changchun, nanjing, zhongshan and xian. it is planned that we will develop few more new points and the target cities are dongguan, zhuhai, yantai, suzhou and tianjin.
c. endeavour to improve the return on funds employed in every project through stringent control of payments and receipts, active promotion of sales of all projects at the best time and maintaining our good policy of low inventory at all times.
china overseas property group co ltd ( cop ), in which the group has 79% interest, has ended its a share pre-listing nurture period in august 2003. to comply with the regulatory requirements of the listing of cop, an assets restructure exercise was required and the said exercise was approved by the shareholders of the company in an extraordinary general meeting held on 30 january 2004. the board would like to remind all shareholders that the final timetable for the listing and the commercial consideration are yet to be determined. as soon as the spin-off application of cop is made, the group will publish further announcement and seek shareholders approval (if required) in accordance with the listing rules.
ii. in the announcement made by the company on 19 january 2004, the board confirmed our consideration to combine all or part of the group s construction related businesses with those of china overseas holdings limited, the controlling shareholder of the company. the combined businesses will be put under a new company ( newco ) and it is intended that newco will apply for listing by way of introduction to the stock exchange of hong kong limited following by a special dividend in kind of the group s interest in newco to the shareholders of the company. the board believes that the restructure if materialized will clear the lines of business for the group. the board would like to inform shareholders that the restructure is actively in progress. when the official application for the listing of newco is made, the group will make further announcement and seek shareholders approval in compliance with the listing rules.
iii. the group will continue to look actively for infrastructure related projects to offset the effects of repurchase by chinese counterparties of our interests in the guangxi infrastructure projects. the board believes that it is important for the group to have stable long term income to offset the cyclical nature of property development business.
iv. into year 2004, the hong kong property market has rebounded strongly, particularly in the luxury sector. the sale of the stanley regalia bay project (in which the group has 30% interest) has a breakthrough. over 50% of the project has been sold so far and provisions have been written back this financial year. assuming that the current favorable market condition can maintain, the board expects further provisions write back can be made in future. the group will continue to watch the hong kong property market closely and for opportunities in city redevelopment projects cautiously. in the short term, our focus is to accelerate sale of inventory.
the board is optimistic about the economy and property market in macau. in february this year, the group has secured a piece of land in macau with gross development area of about 140,000 sq.m. the project is expected to be completed by 2006.
v. the group will continue to adopt a prudent financial policy to ensure the persistent and healthy growth of the group. taking into consideration the business operation of the group, we will endeavour to control our gearing level to no more than 50% at all times. due to the effective control of payments and receipts and notwithstanding the rapid expansion of the prc property business, the net gearing ratio of the group as at the end of year 2003 was decreased further to 3%. in line with the strategic expansion, it is expected that the capital expenditure of the group could be substantial. the group seized the opportunity in the capital market and raised hk$1.5 billion by placing 850 million shares of the company at the price of hk$1.8 per share to institutional investors on 26 january 2004. at present, we have cash on hand of hk$3.8 billion and unutilized banking facilities of hk$3.7 billion. the group is hence financially sound and has adequate financial resources to meet internal requirements and new business opportunities.
on behalf of the board, i would like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude for the support of the shareholders and our business partners and the contribution of our staff.
