chairman s statement on behalf of your board, i am pleased to present my report on the operations of the group for the financial year ended 31 december 2010.
profit and net assets attributable
the group s profit attributable to equity shareholders for the year ended 31 december 2010 amounted to hk$163 million, compared to hk$156 million for the corresponding 18-month period ended 31 december 2009, an increase of hk$7 million or 5%. earnings per share for the year were hk 5.3 cents (18-month period ended 31 december 2009: hk 5.1 cents).
at 31 december 2010, the net asset value attributable to equity shareholders amounted to approximately hk$1,615 million or hk$0.53 per share.

your board recommends the payment of a final dividend of hk 2.0 cents per share to shareholders whose names appear on the register of members of the company on thursday, 9 june 2011, and such final dividend will not be subject to any withholding tax in hong kong. including the interim dividend of hk 2.0 cents per share already paid, the total dividend for the year ended 31 december 2010 will amount to hk 4.0 cents per share (18-month period ended 31 december 2009: hk 6.0 cents per share). final dividend will be distributed to shareholders on friday, 10 june 2011.

the group is engaged in the infrastructure business in mainland china. in march 2009, the group entered into an agreement to sell its entire interest in maanshan city ring road, a toll road situated in anhui province. with completion of the transaction in february 2010, a net gain on disposal attributable to equity shareholders of hk$26 million was recognized in the year ended 31 december 2010.
after divesting its entire interest in maanshan city ring road, the core asset in the group s portfolio is its 60% interest in hangzhou qianjiang third bridge which is a major trunk route linking beijing and fujian province. it is located on national highway no.104 in zhejiang province, spanning approximately 5.8 km over the qiantangjiang river in hangzhou and connecting the urban parts of southern hangzhou and xiaoshan and binjiang. the toll bridge is also an important nodal point for access to major roads leading to the hangzhou airport.
the group recorded a turnover of hk$317 million for the year ended 31 december 2010 compared to hk$441 million for the corresponding 18-month period ended 31 december 2009. the breakdown of the group s turnover is as follows: for a better appreciation of the group s performance, a comparison is made between the group s turnover for the year ended 31 december 2010 and that for the corresponding period of 12 months ended 31 december 2009 with the latter excluding the turnover from maanshan city ring road for that period. on this basis, the group s turnover of hk$317 million for the year ended 31 december 2010 represents an increase of hk$45 million, or 17%, over and above the turnover of hk$272 million for the corresponding period of 12 months ended 31 december 2009. such increase was attributable to the increase in traffic volume of hangzhou qianjiang third bridge during the year ended 31 december 2010 when compared to the corresponding period of 12 months ended 31 december 2009.
based on a comparison of the group s profit attributable to equity shareholders for the year ended 31 december 2010 of hk$163 million with that for the corresponding period of 12 months ended 31 december 2009 of hk$95 million, the group s profit attributable to equity shareholders for the year under review represents an increase of hk$68 million or 72%. such increase was mainly attributable to the increased profit contribution from hangzhou qianjiang third bridge during the year under review of hk$29 million, the net gain on the disposal of the group s entire interest in maanshan huan tong highway development limited (being the joint venture engaged in the operation of maanshan city ring road) attributable to equity shareholders of hk$26 million, and a dividend income received during the year of hk$11 million in relation to a project which was completed in 2004 and in which the group had an 8% interest.

mainland china s economy exhibited robust growth momentum throughout 2010 with an overall year-on-year gdp growth rate of 10.3% for the year, 1.1 percentage points higher than that in 2009. this has benefited hangzhou qianjiang third bridge which has shown an upward trend in its traffic volume. looking ahead, the group believes that its core asset is well placed to benefit from the steady and fast economic development on the mainland expected for 2011.

i would like to take this opportunity to thank my fellow directors for their wise counsel and support, and to thank the management and staff at all levels for their dedication, hard work and contributions in the past year.
