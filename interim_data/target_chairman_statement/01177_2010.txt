facing the severe conditions brought about by the economic downturn resulting from the global financial crisis which erupted in late 2008, the prc government began to implement an economic stimulus policy together with a loose monetary policy in 2009. these efforts have laid a foundation for rapid economic recovery of the country. with the economic condition stabilising, the launching of new medical reform plan , national basic medicine catalogue fundamental version and medical insurance catalogue together with strong financial support from the prc government in the medical and health system reforms, domestic demand in the prc pharmaceutical market rapidly expanded. this in turn allowed the pharmaceutical industry to maintain relatively fast yet steady growth in the past year and thus helped the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry to maintain stable growth in sales and profit.

outlook and prospect the pharmaceutical market will benefit in the long run with the gradual rationalisation of the prc medical system, which in particular will create enormous opportunities for prc pharmaceutical enterprises. moreover, the prc government continued to step up its financial support and has introduced more favourable policies to facilitate the technological innovation in the pharmaceutical sector. the government launched a series of medicine-related policies ranging from registration, pricing to clinical usage, which revealed its support for enterprises in the pursuit of innovation. the group therefore believes that the prc pharmaceutical industry will continue to maintain steady development, with the growth of the industry rooted in steady track.
however, with the launching of a series of new management policies of the pharmaceutical industry in 2010, of which the pharmacopoeia (2010 edition) will be implemented from 1 july, it is expected that the standard of pharmaceutical products be raised and the second round consultation about the new gmp draft edition indicates that the gmp of the domestic medicines are to be aligned with international ones. in addition, the prc government has tightened administration and adopted more stringent regulations controlling the sales of pharmaceutical products, and various standards governing the management of pharmaceutical products, which are expected to cause a heavier burden of costs for industry players, as well as will lead to intensified competition while changing, segregating and upgrading the industry.

at the coal to olefin business perspective, taking heed of the loomed global financial crisis, the group will look for opportunities to secure cheaper source of material for producing olefin. the business is expected to bring stable and promising revenue to the group and provide a new profit growth driver of the group in the long run. since it takes time to assess the impacts on the environment and water resources of such industrial projects, the project is still in the early preparation event after the reporting period in january, 2010, the company has announced a top-up placing of existing shares and subscription of new shares under general mandate whereby china life insurance (overseas) company, limited, citic securities international investment management (hk) limited, for china alpha ii fund and citic securities international investment management (hk) limited, for citic securities alpha leaders fund have purchased 200,000,000, 27,500,000 and 27,500,000 shares of the company, respectively, at hk$2.1 per share.
