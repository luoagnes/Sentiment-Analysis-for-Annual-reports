the global economy is expected to proceed on a firmer footing for the year ahead on the back of broadening recovery in the us and stabilizing growth in the mainland economy. although the us federal reserve is poised to end its asset purchase programme soon and geo-political risks in some regions are likely to linger, relatively loose monetary conditions are widely expected to be maintained in major developed economies for an extended period, lending support to a more solid recovery in the world economy.
the growth of the mainland economy i s expected to stabilize further with the help of a series of easing measures on a selective basis.
the economy will also show more balanced growth with the focus of economic development shifting from speed to quality. consolidation in residential markets in mainland cities that started in the first half of 2014 is expected to continue in the coming months, but transaction volumes are likely to improve on the back of loosening mortgage credit conditions and selective relaxation of property measures. in addition, growing household income and a shift to a more consumption-driven development model will bode well for premium retail space demand over time. the group remains confident in the prospects for the mainland economy and its property sector over the medium to long term.
hong kong s economic fundamentals are expected to stay healthy despite the recent slowdown in retail sales and public debate over the future political system. a mildly improving export outlook, continuing infrastructure works and solid consumption demand underpinned by low unemployment should steer the economy to show modest growth. in hong kong s residential sector, solid end-user demand for small- to medium-sized units and the prevailing low interest rate environment coupled with reasonable affordability should help sustain transactions at healthy levels, particularly in the primary market. however, the stringent housing measures in place will continue to restrain demand from investors and non-local purchasers. private residential completions are likely to remain limited in the near future, as gradually increasing land supply will take time to translate into completed housing with adequate saleable resources including more small-to medium-sized units available for sale both in hong kong and on the mainland, the group will continue to launch projects on the market when they are ready. in addition to the recently launched the wings iiia in tseung kwan o which received positive market responses, major residential projects in hong kong to be launched in the next nine months include the wings iiib, phase 1 of the tung chung project and deauville in tsuen wan west. major mainland projects to be offered for sale include quality offices in forest hills in guangzhou near the guangzhou-hong kong through-train station, luxury units at shanghai cullinan as part of the shanghai icc integrated project and a batch of new units with spectacular views of the bund at shanghai arch in lujiazui.
the sizable investment property portfolio of the group is expected to fare well in the coming year with continuous positive rental reversions and sustained high occupancies, both in hong kong and on the mainland. the portfolio will also be further enhanced with the continuous additions of new projects. the group will constantly review its investment properties and institute various improvements including repositioning tenant mixes, and renovating and upgrading buildings to optimize its portfolio. at the same time, the group will continue to review options for the disposal of non-core properties.
the group s shopping mall network will continue to expand. in hong kong, a mall at yoho midtown is scheduled to open in 2015, as part of a mega mall in yuen long. in addition, shopping malls under development include a waterfront retail project beneath a residential development in north point and a shopping centre underneath a large-scale residential project at the nam cheong station. in guangzhou, parc central, a shopping mall in the core business district of guangzhou, will be completed in 2015. this, together with a mall at the tianhui plaza in the zhujiang new town, will help the group establish a strong foothold in the retail leasing market in the pearl river delta.
in shanghai, the shopping mall being planned as part of the large-scale xujiahui centre project in xuhui, upon completion, will further enhance the area as a premier shopping destination in the city.
the mainland investment property portfolio will be an increasingly important source of growth for the group in the foreseeable future. the xujiahui centre project in shanghai, when completed, will further boost the group s leadership role in the commercial leasing market in this financial hub, given that the group already has two very successful flagship projects shanghai ifc and shanghai icc operating in the city. over the next few years, the group s total floor area of completed investment properties on the mainland is likely to increase markedly, particularly in shanghai. the share of rental income from the mainland in the group s overall rental revenue will also increase over time.
the group s hotel business is expected to continue to grow with the projects opened over recent years continuing to see their business pick up. the hotel portfolio of the group will further strengthen as there are a number of projects being planned and developed both in hong kong and on the mainland, including a waterfront hotel in north point in hong kong that has recently begun construction. this expanding hotel network will create more synergy with the group s other property businesses and enhance the group s recurring income over time.
the group is committed to achieving a balance between earnings from property sales and investment properties. the continuing cash flows from property sales and rental income will help the group capture appropriate business opportunities while maintaining the gearing at a healthy level. with a large land bank sufficient for at least five years development, the group will be able to increase production volume over time. the group will continue to acquire land particularly in hong kong where there is a gradually increasing land supply, and adhere to a selective approach when expanding on the mainland, focusing mainly on first-tier cities such as beijing, shanghai and guangzhou. the group will continue to produce premium products that best suit customer preference, particularly small- to medium-sized units both in hong kong and on the mainland. greater effort will be applied to controlling construction costs while maintaining the quality of its products and services. savings will be achieved through more cost-effective designs while maximizing the economies of scale resulting from the group s extensive over the past several decades, the group has built its businesses on increasingly strong foundations. a strong balance sheet with high liquidity, a well-respected brand that has earned the trust of customers, and a corporate culture that emphasizes building homes with heart and continuous learning, are the central characteristics. time-tested strategies, in particular prudent financial management discipline, enable continuous business development in times of both prosperity and downturn. the seasoned, professional and longserving management team working together with the stable and devoted staff has continued to strengthen the group s competitive advantage. the group also maintains a high level of corporate governance and sound management structure. with these robust foundations, the group is well positioned to secure business opportunities and overcome challenges even in the face of uncertainties.
barring unforeseen circumstances, the group s results for the coming financial year are expected to be satisfactory.
