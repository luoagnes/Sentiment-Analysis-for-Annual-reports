in 2011, market competition and government policies have severely affected the antibiotic industry. market demand weakened and product price showed a continued decline. the operating environment was particularly difficult in the second half of the year. during the year, the chinese government promulgated the administrative measures on the clinical use of antibacterial drugs (consultation draft) , imposing a more stringent control on antibacterial drugs and regulating the volume used in hospitals. following implementation of the new gmp in china, certain manufacturers expanded production capacity and modified production line at the same time. besides, with the tender system orientated towards the lowest-price bidder, tender price and purchase volume of antibiotic drugs both dropped significantly. all these factors led to a slowdown in market demand for bulk drugs and a decline in product price, pessimistic sentiment prevailed in the market. under this tough market environment, the group devised various marketing strategies and made every effort to secure new customers in the domestic and overseas markets.
sales volume for the year managed to increase slightly as compared with last year whereas revenue decreased by 5.1% to hk$3,092 million.
market competition is still expected to remain keen in 2012. given that price level has been staying at a very low level for some time, it is expected that the market players, for the sake of survival and profitability, will make possible a slight rebound. the group will continue to improve production technology, flexibly adjust marketing strategies according to market changes and reinforce product penetration in order to improve the performance of this business and expand its market presence.

business review and outlook (continued) finished drugs business through effective marketing strategies and development of end-user markets, this business saw a relatively satisfactory growth in the first half of 2011. however, following the adoption of anhui model (lowest-price bidding) in essential drug tenders across china and the promulgation of the administrative measures on the clinical use of antibacterial drugs (consultation draft) , market conditions aggravated in the second half of the year. not only the tender prices of essential drug products fell significantly in every province, the volume used in the basic-tier medical institutions also reduced noticeably.
during 2011, satisfactory results were achieved from the group s effort to expand sales to end-user customers by the establishment of new local offices in addition to its existing provincial offices. under the tough market conditions of essential drugs, sales volumes of the group s major products including amoxicillin capsules and ceftriaxone sodium injections remained stable or even recorded a slight growth, far surpassing other market players. regarding non- essential drugs, sales volumes of products with high gross margin including meropenem injections and traditional chinese medicine injections rose significantly through enhancing sales network and using of effective sales strategies.
notwithstanding the tough challenges, revenue of this business for the year increased by 6.4% to hk$2,423 million.
looking forward to 2012, the overall essential drug market will continue to be under the shadow of the macro policies concerning tender system, drug price cut and regulation of the use of antibacterial drugs. however, being the most major type of drug among the anti-infective, antibiotics has been occupying a mainstream position in the market for its efficacy, low price level and wide application. with the natural growth and ageing of population, migration of people from rural to urban areas, improvement of the basic medical insurance system and promotion of essential drugs in china, overall usage of antibiotics will be able to maintain a growth momentum, though at a restrained growth rate. on the other hand, the implementation of new gmp will lead to a higher requirement for investment and product quality management. this will accelerate the phase-out of small and medium manufacturers and the market will be more concentrated in large enterprise as the group.
in 2012, the group will continue to devise new sales strategies, improve sales channels and develop end-user market. it will also step up its efforts in product registration and market development in the international market, striving to expand its export business. regarding product portfolio, the group will put more efforts in the sales of non-antibiotic products and speed up the development and launch of new products with a view to reducing its dependence on antibiotic products.

as market conditions of all the operating units are expected to remain difficult, the overall operating results of the group in 2012 will continue to be under pressure. the group will adopt the operating strategies mentioned above and strive to alleviate the adverse impact of the market challenges. we are confident that we would be able to overcome these challenges and further consolidate our leading position in the market.
