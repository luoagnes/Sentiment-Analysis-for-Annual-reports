business development in china the group continues to expand its foothold on the mainland and invest in natural gas projects as a long-term strategic priority for its core business china s entry into the world trade organization is boosting prosperity of the national economy leading to an increasing need for energy, in particular a surge in the demand for clean fuel. as the laying of natural gas trunklines is in progress, a national policy to improve the energy mix has been gradually implemented in cities nationwide. by encouraging the construction of natural gas infrastructure, the government strives to promote the use of natural gas to replace polluting fuels such as coal and heavy oil to enhance urban air quality.
this national policy favours expansion of the group s core business on the mainland.
since the fourth quarter of 2003, the west-to-east gas pipeline has gradually started supplying natural gas to east china and this will soon extend to the group s city piped gas projects in jiangsu, anhui, etc., helping to drive rapid growth in commercial, industrial and residential gas consumption. other areas will also be supplied with natural gas from in 2003, the group particularly focused on developing its mainland business within the economically prosperous regions of guangdong, east china, shandong and central china where natural gas supply is imminent and achieved good progress. the group has thus far concluded 24 city piped gas joint venture projects on the mainland, including those in large-scale cities such as shenzhen, nanjing, wuhan and jinan.
the group s mainland joint ventures have been operating well and are gaining a reputation for safe operation and provision of quality services which is enhancing the group s standing with municipal governments and local citizens and creating substantial positive media publicity.
in line with the group s development strategy, our investment holding company, hong kong & china gas investment limited, established in shenzhen, guangdong province in early 2002, manages the group s mainland businesses and is playing an important role in ensuring the effective development of our joint ventures.
following the arrival of natural gas in various mainland regions, the group will continue to negotiate with more cities for prime piped gas joint ventures taking into consideration of the economic development of the cities.
impact of sars outbreak on the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) in hong kong, starting in mid-march 2003 and lasting for over three months, had a devastating impact on different business sectors due to the drastic fall in the number of inbound visitors and fragile local consumer sentiment. although there was a rise in residential gas sales, the impact of the sars outbreak on the restaurant and hotel sector led to a fall in commercial and industrial gas sales.
as a result, overall gas sales volume for the year was lower than expected.
to bring relief to the restaurant and hotel sector in hong kong, the group allowed this sector to apply for an extension of the credit payment period for two months for the period from may through july 2003. the response to this was favourable with about 3,000 customers benefiting from this measure, involving a combined bill amount totalling about hk$200 million. in partnership with the hong kong catering industry association, the group also sponsored hk$2 million for a four-month programme to promote hygiene in restaurants so as to revive consumer confidence in dining out.
