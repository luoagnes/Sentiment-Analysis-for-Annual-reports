property business hong kong

the year under review, particularly the latter half, was challenging for property sales amid various government measures to regulate and cool the market. secondary market activity has slowed down meaningfully since late february this year following the adoption of further stringent government demand-side management measures. in the first-hand market, relatively few new projects were launched for sale after the new ordinance on first-hand residential sales became effective in late april and sales of remaining units in existing projects were also affected. this led to a significant drop in first-hand residential sales in the past few months.
despite all these policy headwinds, low mortgage interest rates, reasonable repayment affordability, continuing income growth and positive demographic factors continued to support the demand from local end users. this helps underpin the resilience of residential property prices, particularly for the segment of small- to medium-sized units.
contracted sales in hong kong during the year amounted to over hk$22,000 million, despite an unfavourable property sales market. major residential projects sold included the wings ii in tseung kwan o, the first phase of century gateway in tuen mun and residence 88 in yuen long. the group also disposed of selected investment properties such as kowloon commerce centre to meet keen demand from end users.
the group has always done its utmost to satisfy customer needs by delivering the right products and quality service. it adds value at all stages of development from designing master layout plans and flat mixes to materials and finishes and on to attentive management service. this has resulted in many of the territory s most recognizable projects over the years and earned the group a trusted brand name and leading market position, which further enhances the competitiveness of its the group completed five projects with 1.9 million square feet of attributable gross floor area in hong kong during the year. they included 820,000 square feet of residential properties and 810,000 square feet of offices, both of which are 90% sold. the premium v city shopping mall in tuen mun and other retail space are being kept as rental properties.

the group owns and manages over 28.6 million square feet of welldiversified investment properties in hong kong. this sizable portfolio creates synergy among properties, especially within integrated the leasing market in hong kong remained solid and healthy while the group s premium properties continued to be the favoured option for business expansion and relocation alternatives. for the year under review, the group s gross rental income from hong kong, including contributions from joint-venture projects, rose by 9% to hk$13,289 million, primarily attributable to positive rental reversions and higher rents for new leases.
a high occupancy of over 95% was achieved for the group s rental long-term relationships with tenants are maintained by offering highquality premises and service. constant upgrades enable the group to maintain superior building quality, while premium management service further enhances its competitiveness. the continual development of new premium investment properties across the territory strengthened the group s leading position in the hong kong leasing market. to optimize its portfolio of unparalleled scale and diversity, the group will continue to review options for non-core property disposal.

the group is in a leading position in hong kong s retail leasing market and has a diverse collection of quality shopping malls amounting to over ten million square feet of gross floor area. the unique positioning of each mall serves to target customers with distinctive needs. occupancy stayed high and positive rental reversions were achieved throughout the group s malls in traditional shopping destinations such as ifc mall in central once again delivered impressive performance with high occupancies and increased rents. its extensive shopping centre network extends beyond traditional shopping districts and has wide coverage in both the western and eastern parts of the territory. many of these malls are easily accessible via adjoining mtr stations and a number of them are regional centres with broad customer bases.
the opening of v city in august this year represents another important step for the group in expanding its shopping mall portfolio heavy traffic at v city since opening with its well-balanced store mix and easy in the western part of the territory. this new mall along the west rail brought different, new tenants to tuen mun, introducing a fresh lifestyle concept targeting young locals, professionals and tourists in the region. it has a well-balanced store mix with trendy fashion, accessories and beauty products, as well as well-known restaurants. the mall s unique position in the region, footbridges connecting neighboring areas and direct connections to both the west rail and light rail contributed to the heavy traffic since opening. tenant sales have also been better than expected. the fully-leased v city is expected to become the energized focal point of tuen mun s retail the portfolio along the east rail also performed well. new town plaza consistently attracted large crowds of shoppers after recent refinements to layout and tenant mix. landmark north by the border continued to see rising shopper spending. apm is a regional mall at the heart of the emerging kowloon east business hub and well-positioned to capture growing retail spending in the region.
future additions to the group s retail portfolio span various parts of hong kong, and two are located along the west rail. the premium mall in the nam cheong station development is scheduled to be completed in phases from 2017. this iconic shopping mall of nearly 300,000 square feet in west kowloon is expected to benefit from its exceptional location at the interchange of the west rail and tung chung lines. yoho mall, adjoining yuen long station, will be formed by two existing malls and a new mall under construction. it will be the largest shopping mall, covering one million square feet, in the northwest new territories when on hong kong island, a premium shopping mall in a high-quality residentialcommercial project on the north point waterfront is in the pipeline, and this will generate synergy with the group s seafront hotel project next door.
retail space in projects under development in tseung kwan o will also further strengthen the group s market position in this energetic community with a growing population. these additions will together enlarge the group s diversified portfolio and reinforce its leading role in the market.
the group always recognizes the importance of continuous improvement and carefully devises plans for portfolio upgrades. the reconfiguration of grand century place above mong kok east station has been progressing on schedule. a more contemporary image and fresh elements such as duplex fashion units will further boost the mall s appeal to shoppers upon completion in 2015. the planned renovation of metroplaza adjacent kwai fong station is expected to enhance its the trend of office relocation and expansion to new high-potential business areas continues to benefit the group s well-diversified hong kong office portfolio of approximately ten million square feet. during the year under review, overall occupancy remained high with steady growth in rental income. properties outside of central did particularly well.
international commerce centre (icc) on top of airport express kowloon station and next to the coming high-speed rail terminal has helped establish west kowloon as a premier business district in hong kong. it is complemented by world-class facilities including two luxury hotels, serviced suites and an upscale mall. the sky100 hong kong observation deck and the recently-launched iconic icc light and music show further enhance the attractiveness of the complex. the virtually fully-let icc continued to be the preferred choice of grade-a offices for multinational and mainland corporations, and this robust demand led to higher spot across other non-central districts in hong kong, the group has strong presence in the office market. sun hung kai centre and central plaza by victoria harbour on hong kong island, millennium city in kowloon east, as well as grand central plaza and metroplaza in the new territories are examples of quality non-central office space that have attracted tenants from diverse sectors, leading to high occupancies and increased rent for the year under review.
as the symbol of hong kong s core business district, international financial centre (ifc) continues to lead the central office market amid a stabilizing global economy and achieved high occupancy. the two iconic towers above hong kong station maintained their competitive edge of direct linkage to the airport express and superior quality with world-class facilities and specifications. extensive ancillary components like a highend hotel, luxury serviced suites and a prestigious mall round out the complex. near-term new office supply in central is expected to be limited and ifc continues to attract interest from international and mainland the group leverages its expertise to explore strategies for enhancing the value of existing properties. besides regular upkeep and renovations to enhance building quality, the group also aims to generate added value through various approaches like incorporating green elements in world-class specifications and facilities at international commerce centre in hong kong appeal to multinationals residential and serviced suites signature homes is the group s renowned affiliate for residential leasing, which oversees around one million attributable square feet of luxury accommodation and around 700 attributable serviced suites in hong kong.

the group held an attributable 81.1 million square feet in its mainland land bank as at the end of june 2013. about 71.6 million square feet were properties under development, of which over 75% will be high-end residences or serviced apartments. the rest will be premium offices, shopping malls and hotels. the group also held 9.5 million square feet of completed investment properties on the mainland, comprising mainly premium offices and shopping centres at prime locations in shanghai and the group acquired a prime site at xujiahui, one of the busiest commercial hubs and most popular precincts for shopping and entertainment in shanghai in september this year. this solely-owned integrated project has a total floor area of 7.6 million square feet, including about 1.3 million square feet of underground floor area, and will comprise high-end office, shopping and hotel premises.

the residential markets in major mainland cities saw satisfactory sales over the past few months supported by solid end-user demand, while home prices stayed on an uptrend amid buyer confidence. land prices in prime cities rose with limited supply and real estate developers enthusiasm for replenishing their land banks in view of satisfactory home sales.
the group achieved robust contracted sales of about hk$10,000 million in attributable terms on the mainland during the year under review, well exceeding expectations at the beginning of the financial year. sales of the wholly-owned shanghai arch, a new standard for luxury residential development in the city, continued to be a major contributor, while a number of joint-venture projects were also well received by the market.
the group completed four residential projects with about two million square feet of attributable gross floor area on the mainland during the year.

the group s residential projects under development on the mainland are progressing as planned. the first phase of shanghai arch with over 500,000 square feet of gross floor area is slated for completion by the end of this year. phase 1a of the forest hills high-end residence in tianhe, guangzhou has about 430,000 square feet of gross floor area. the units are virtually sold out and expected to be completed in the second half of 2014. in early september this year, a new batch of units at phase 1b of forest hills were put on the market and have been well received.

the gradual full completion of mainland landmark investment properties has further reinforced the group s prestigious brand on the mainland.
rental income from mainland investment properties has become a meaningful contributor to the group s recurring income. gross rental income from the mainland, including contributions from joint-venture projects, rose by 28% to hk$2,067 million for the year under review as a result of higher rents for new leases and renewals and greater contributions from new investment properties. this was despite an economic slowdown on the mainland.
the group continues to expand its investment property portfolio at key locations in major mainland cities. the newly-acquired xujiahui centre project in the core area of xuhui district in shanghai is the latest milestone addition to the group s mainland property portfolio. it is one of the few projects connected to an interchange of three metro lines in shanghai.
the project will have a total gross floor area of over seven million square feet for premium shopping, office and hotel premises.
leveraging its experience in developing largescale iconic projects such as ifc, icc and new town plaza in hong kong, which are also at strategic rail stations, the group will certainly make the project successful and a new landmark in the city like shanghai ifc and shanghai icc. the xujiahui centre project, upon completion, is expected to become one of the major rental income contributors.
other major investment properties under development include the hong cheng project in guangzhou and minhang project in shanghai.
construction of the 50%-owned hong cheng project near tianhe metro station in guangzhou has been progressing well. it will offer around 900,000 square feet of retail space. another integrated project above xinzhuang metro station in minhang, shanghai will include a 1.5-millionsquare- foot regional mall. the group has a 35% interest in this project and construction is targeted to commence in the first quarter of next year. these projects, together with xujiahui centre project, will strengthen the group s market position on the mainland and make increasingly significant contributions to its recurring income in the medium-to-long the group s latest completed investment property on the mainland is the luxury 1.3-million-square-foot iapm shopping mall, which is a part of the flagship integrated shanghai icc project. this upscale mall follows the success of the late-night shopping concept at apm in hong kong and features over 230 tenants, including international trendy luxury retailers, fine dining restaurants, a state-of-the-art cinema and a lifestyle supermarket. the fully-let iapm has drawn high traffic since its soft opening in august this year. the group is confident that the success of iapm will lead to a significant increase in rental income from its mainland shanghai icc has two premium office towers of about 1.3 million square feet. one icc is almost fully-let with reputable international firms as tenants. the construction of two icc is expected to be completed in financial year 201415. pre-leasing of two icc will commence next year, focusing on major multinational companies, professional firms and mainland corporations. icc residence, offering over 200,000 square feet of luxury apartments for lease, is at the stage of interior decoration and will set a new standard of living in shanghai.
shanghai ifc is a standout integrated development with a direct connection to the lujiazui metro station. the 1.2 million-square-foot shanghai ifc mall targets high-spending locals and tourists on the mainland. traffic remained high and tenants businesses were further boosted with the opening of phase 2 last year. on top of a number of top-tier flagship stores in phase 1, phase 2 introduced more renowned luxury retailers for fashion, jewellery and international cuisine. the mall is virtually fully leased and has drawn continuous interest from many prospective tenants since it opened in 2010, showing good rental growth the two office towers of shanghai ifc have attracted a spectrum of renowned banks, multinational corporations and professional firms. tower one is fully occupied. tower two recorded increased occupancy. the ifc residence serviced suites providing luxurious accommodations for senior executives and expatriates saw a gradual rise in occupancy over the past year.

hong kong s hotel sector maintained high occupancy, underpinned mainly by solid growth in the number of visitors from the mainland.
against this background, the group s hotels in hong kong continued to deliver satisfactory performance during the year under review. since the opening in late 2012, overall business has been gathering momentum at the holiday inn express hong kong kowloon east, while the crowne plaza hong kong kowloon east continued to attract more premium travellers and saw its restaurants and wedding business performing well. the group s other seven hotels in hong kong, the four seasons hotel hong kong, the ritz-carlton, hong kong, w hong kong and the four royal brand hotels, were able to keep average occupancy at a high level of above 90% during the year.
the ritz-carlton shanghai, pudong achieved increased occupancy and room rates despite a highly-competitive environment, and its restaurant with magnificent views of the bund has increasingly been a hotspot for local residents and visitors.
the acquisition of a waterfront hotel site in north point in hong kong through public tender in march this year will further strengthen the group s hotel portfolio. this site can accommodate 388,000 square feet of gross floor area and will create a synergy with the adjacent residential commercial site currently under development.
telecommunications and information
smartone saw an increase in local mobile service revenue and customer numbers during the year despite intense market competition.
profitability was however pressured by lower roaming revenue and higher costs. the company launched its 4g network during the year and the acquisition of additional spectrum will enable further improvements in network quality and capacity in a cost-effective way.

modest global economic growth is expected to continue with diminished systematic risks in the year ahead, supported mainly by an improving us economy and continuously accommodative monetary policies of major central banks. although worries over an earlier exit of the us quantitative easing may dampen market sentiment and hence result in financial market volatility, major global interest rates including the us fed funds rate are likely to remain low for an extended period of time.
the mainland economy is likely to improve gradually in the months ahead, with government stimulus measures keeping economic growth and employment at acceptable levels. the central government s focus on structural reforms should help foster more sustainable growth over the long term. this should serve as a driver for hong kong s long-term economic development. in the near term, hong kong s economic expansion is expected to remain moderate, supported by continuous growth in domestic consumer spending, follow-through of transportation infrastructure works and expanding export service including tourism.
residential markets, both on the mainland and in hong kong, will continue to be influenced by respective policy measures. on the mainland, demand from first-time buyers amid ongoing urbanization is expected to remain robust, while the sales of high-end units will continue to be restrained by home purchase restrictions. in hong kong, the new ordinance on first-hand sales has increased costs and time for preparing projects for sale. more importantly, the government s stringent measures, particularly various types of stamp duty, will continue to restrain various kinds of demand, though first-time buyers who usually purchase small- to medium-sized units will be less affected. nevertheless, low mortgage rates, reasonable repayment affordability and continuous income growth will underpin potential residential demand. while the supply of new housing units will remain limited in the near term, the government s continuous efforts to increase housing and land supply should be conducive to long-term healthy development of the property market, offering more business opportunities for the sector. the group remains positive about the prospects for hong kong s residential market over the medium-tolong the group will step up efforts to quicken the process of obtaining presale consents and put new projects in hong kong and on the mainland up for sale when ready. major new residential projects to be launched in hong kong over the next nine months will include century gateway ii at mtr tuen mun station, imperial kennedy in the western part of hong kong island, a residential project in fanling and riva in yuen long east.
the majority of these new launches will be small- to medium-sized units, which will be relatively easily absorbed in the current market conditions.
the group also plans to put a new batch of the cullinan in west kowloon and two office projects being developed on hoi bun road in kwun tong and wong chuk hang road in island south on the market. major mainland projects that will go on sale include the quality offices in the integrated tianhui plaza in guangzhou, premium homes and shops at oriental bund in foshan and additional batches of other projects including shanghai arch in lujiazui.
the group will continue to bolster its leading market position through its steadily growing investment property portfolio. regular tenant mix reviews and property upgrades will continue to enhance both the capital and rental values of the group s existing investment property portfolio. its rental income will continue to grow in hong kong and on the mainland, driven by high occupancies with rising rents in the existing portfolio and new contributions from new shopping malls including v city in tuen mun, hong kong and iapm at shanghai icc. the yoho mall next to mtr yuen long station, a premium mall atop mtr nam cheong station and a shopping mall on the north point waterfront in the next few years will make the group s shopping network more comprehensive and competitive across hong kong. investment properties under development on the mainland include the hong cheng shopping mall near tianhe metro station in guangzhou and an integrated project in minhang district atop xinzhuang metro station in shanghai. the new acquisition of the xujiahui centre project, comprising premium office, shopping and hotel premises, will become a new landmark in shanghai and one of the major contributors to the group s rental income on the mainland. all these projects, upon complet ion, wi l l accelerate the rental income growth over the the group continues to capitalize on the opportunities arising from growing tourism in the region. the acquisition of a hotel site in north point in hong kong in march this year and future hotels in key mainland cities developed as parts of integrated projects will further boost the group s position in the hospitality industry and recurrent income from its hotel portfolio over time.
the group s current land bank will enable it to increase production volume over the medium term. it will focus more on developing smallto medium-sized units in response to the market environment in hong kong, and continue to follow a selective and focused approach to the property business in key mainland cities including beijing, shanghai, guangzhou and shenzhen.
focusing on enhancing asset turnover, the group will continue to launch residential projects for sale and proactively dispose of selected non-core property assets. these moves, together with its strong recurrent income and healthy financial position, will enable the group to selectively grasp good business opportunities to invest in projects with high development potential. the group will also continue to enhance its leading position by differentiating in terms of products and customer service, further raising its brand name to command price premiums. it will adhere to the goal of achieving a balance between earnings from property sales and looking ahead, a high standard of corporate governance, seasoned management team and robust balance sheet with healthy gearing will continue to enable the group to sustain business development in a competitive and challenging environment. barring unforeseen circumstances, the results for the coming financial year are expected to
