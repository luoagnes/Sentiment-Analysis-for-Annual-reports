all the core businesses of the group continued to develop and expand along our growth roadmap in 2004. it was a reflection of our strength in establishing new ventures and operating businesses under prudent, effective management, and our ability to capitalise on the market upturn.

in 2004, hong kong s economy continued to rebound strongly on the back of the global economic revival and the central government supported policies. real gdp growth was 8.1%, primarily driven by the robust growth in exports and retail sales. a strong boost in domestic demand led to the ending of the protracted deflationary period in hong kong, and more job opportunities helped to alleviate the problem of the property market recorded a steady growth in transactions and prices for the year despite a few months of slowing sales in mid-2004, demonstrating that the market is supported by strong underlying demand and is now back on track to a steady recovery. in tandem with sustainable economic growth, a number of factors such as a stable land supply, good responses to land sales, the offering of 95% mortgages, as well as reduced cases of negative equity are creating favourable conditions which could further boost the market. we look forward to more optimistic prospects for the property market, and there is room for further firming of residential prices.

our property business delivered solid results in the face of stiff competition. while significant strides were made in terms of project design, building construction, sales volume and cost control, we also recorded satisfactory revenue both from property sales and treasury investments. for the year 2004, the group s profit before share of results of the hutchison whampoa group increased by 50%.

the group s landbank has continued to expand in recent years, and it has been further strengthened following a number of key acquisitions of prime sites and investment properties during the year based on the reviving market. currently we have an ample landbank to support development over the next four to five years.
the group s policy has always been to ensure that the gross floor area of land reserve and properties for sale are maintained at a healthy ratio. we will keep the pace of landbank expansion in step with market conditions and attuned to our needs for medium and long term development.
office occupancy and rentals are expected to improve further in hong kong s commercial property market.
this is largely driven by the return of investor confidence given the positive economic outlook, and increased investment from local and international firms, particularly those from mainland enterprises following the introduction of the investment facilitation policies. hotels and retail properties will also benefit from increasing tourist arrivals. the group acquired two hotel projects during the year under review, and the performance of the quality portfolio of investment properties was satisfactory. occupancy rates and rentals are expected to rise as our properties continue to enrich their service offering.

we achieved solid results in our property ventures outside of hong kong. during the year under review, good progress was made on all fronts including land acquisition, property development, brand recognition, and revenue enhancement both from sales and leasing. with our extensive experience in the property sector and our unique development strategy and principles, we have achieved considerable success over the years.
looking ahead, the group will continue to extend our foothold beyond hong kong by cautiously selecting potential markets in the mainland as well as overseas with the aim of bringing additional value to the group.

in 2004, cheung kong infrastructure holdings limited ( cki ) realised a number of expansion strategies and continued its course of organic growth. cki has developed a strong foundation for future investments and expansion. it is poised to reap the rewards of its much-strengthened investment portfolio while pursuing new investments and considering fresh opportunities in australia, europe and north america. 2004 was a year of challenges for the local business of hongkong electric holdings limited ( hongkong electric ), as unforeseen increases in operating costs and a tariff freeze in 2004 resulted in earnings below the permitted level specified in the scheme of control agreement. however, its operations in australia continued to perform strongly and have generated good returns. looking forward, hongkong electric will continue to leverage on its existing resources and expertise to explore new business opportunities and concentrate on selected markets which offer stable returns with manageable risks.

looking ahead to 2005, hong kong will still face many uncertainties involving rising oil prices, higher interest rates, and the continued weakness of the us dollar. however, we expect that the local economy will continue to grow steadily in the coming year, as the overall interest rate level is likely to remain low and the strength in export trade and domestic demand will continue to be strong.
the china factor continues to be a major impetus for hong kong s economic growth. china s macro fine-tuning measures to adjust the pace of economic growth have started to prove their worth. as healthy economic strides are anticipated and the long-term growth momentum is poised to continue, the prospects for the mainland are promising. this also bodes well for hong kong s future. enormous business and growth opportunities have emerged from the accelerated convergence of the economic environments of hong kong and the mainland, and these opportunities will give rise to unlimited international potential. hong kong should position itself to build on its strength and competitiveness to seize the greatest benefit from this positive trend, and to strive for sustainable economic growth.

we have ample human and financial resources in our various businesses to drive future growth in the mainland, hong kong and 45 countries around the globe. the year 2005 promises opportunities as well as challenges. based on the strength of our diversified businesses, global vision and excellent management team, complemented by our well-established reputation and strong financial background, we are confident that the group can meet the opportunities and challenges ahead and will continue to grow our businesses worldwide. we have full confidence in the future prospects for the cheung kong group.
