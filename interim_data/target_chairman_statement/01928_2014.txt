the company s adjusted ebitda reached a record us$2.90 billion with adjusted ebitda margin reaching 32.5% on us$8.91 billion in net revenues in the 2013 year. the venetian macao, our fl agship property on cotai, and the plaza macao each generated record adjusted ebitda during the year. the sands macao, which will celebrate its ten year anniversary in may, also delivered solid operating results for the year. strong growth in non-gaming revenue from our hotel, retail, mall and convention businesses, coupled with robust mass gaming volumes throughout our portfolio of properties, contributed to the record financial results and refl ect the inherent benefits of our integrated resort business model.
sands cotai central, our latest development on cotai and the largest integrated resort development in the companys history, opened its first phase in april 2012. we opened additional offerings and amenities at sands cotai central in 2012 and throughout 2013. sands cotai central has added approximately 5,800 hotel rooms, expansive retail shopping, food and beverage, meeting and convention, entertainment and gaming capacity to cotai and further solidified our position as the leading integrated resort developer and operator in macao.
our properties continue to generate market-leading visitation and in 2013 we welcomed nearly 63 million visitors to our properties, including over 6 million in the month of december alone. we are incredibly proud to be contributing to the increasing visitation to macao and cotai from across the region. importantly, the benefi ts of our integrated resort business model extend far beyond our own fi nancial success. the companys properties and service offerings enhance macaos appeal as a business and leisure tourism destination, helping to diversify macaos economy and to provide meaningful employment opportunities for the people of macao. looking ahead, i am confi dent that the introduction of the parisian macao, our next development on cotai, which we are targeting to open by late 2015, will meaningfully contribute to macaos position as the leading business and leisure destination in asia.
we could not have achieved our record fi nancial results without the hard work and dedication of sands chinas more than 28,000 team members. i thank them for their efforts and i look forward to their continued contributions in the years ahead.
our sands china business strategy remains straightforward: complete the successful execution of our cotai strip development strategy by leveraging our integrated resort business model and world-class amenities to generate market-leading revenue and cash fl ow growth while continuing to increase the return of capital to shareholders. we look forward to sharing the companys continued success with you and other stakeholders at the upcoming sands china annual general meeting.
