we are pleased to announce that nagacorp ltd. ( nagacorp or the company ) reported a net profit of us$25.5 million in 2009 amidst a challenging global gaming market. thanks to our management strength, solid business foundation, robust financial position and unique geographical advantage, we were able to rise above the challenges and deliver solid results in 2009. nagaworld cambodia is today a social, events, business and tourist destination, well patronized and frequented by locals and overseas customers from both public and private sectors.
stable business amidst a challenging global gaming market what is remarkable is that revenue derived from public floor tables increased by 151.3% to us$24.6 million and the revenue from gaming machine stations increased by 1,006.5% to us$34.3 million, which signifies a more stable, profitable and reliable income stream.
attainment of high gross profit margin of 60.4% in 2009 (compared with 45.5% in 2008) has been achieved at the backdrop of cost reduction measures and better business efficiency. direct costs have been cut down by 56%. non-gaming revenue has been increased by 120% as the full impact of a completed nagaworld with all of its amenities is fully functional.
an improving regulatory and supervisory environment of gaming machine stations in cambodia and the closure of slot machine outlets and sports betting stations has since witnessed a notable growth in the number of slot machines and overall business in nagaworld. the average number of slot stations in 2009 was 523, compared with 200 slot machines in 2006. to date, the number of slot stations has increased to 738.
with regard to the public floor, the improving political stability and acceptance and success of nagaworld as a social, recreational, events, business, tourists destination centre, well patronized by locals and overseas visitors, underpinned the 151.3% increase in revenue on the public floors. buy-ins in 2009 were consistently above the level in 2008 and the number of tourist visits, especially from vietnam, continued to increase.

despite a decline in the junket floor business, nagacorp is optimistic and confident in improving its junket business for two important reasons. first is nagaworld s ability to continue exercising flexibility in enhancing its commission structure to benefit junkets because of our low tax rate (for instance our commission payable today is a highly competitive 1.7%). the other key reason is our ability to offer competitive hotel casino services (such as pricing our 5-star hotel rooms at rates below our competitors, and offering superb vip casino services and gaming leisure-related entertainment under one roof). more comprehensive marketing planning initiatives have been launched by dividing our asia marketing map into 3-polar zones, i.e., indo china, china and se asia.
nagaworld has also been talking to regional airlines like shenzhen airlines, mas & caa in order to create more synergy with these carriers. the launch of the premium floors (without junket) has been generating good gaming results.
solid business foundation backed by healthy financial management and credit policy nagacorp continued to be in a net cash position with no gearing. bolstered by cash from operating income and collection from debtors, the cash position of the group was improved and the bank and cash balances were increased by 98%.
as always, we closely monitor and review the performance of our junket operators and constantly seek to maintain a win-win relationship with them. nagacorp s management team has also put in place stringent credit guidelines and supervision in order to manage trade receivables and credit risk. in particular, only bona fide operators with excellent credit records are granted credit facilities. we believe that this stringent credit policy will be beneficial to the control and management of trade receivables in the future. this has resulted in a drop in trade receivables by 15%, from us$60.2 million in 2008 to us$51.0 million in 2009.

attractive dividend yield with dividend payout ratio of approximately 60% the board has resolved to declare a final dividend of 0.40 us cents per share. together with the interim dividend of 0.33 us cents per share, it represents a total dividend payout of approximately 60%, based on net profit for the 12 months ended december 31, 2009. based on the closing market price of hk$0.83 on 8 february 2010, the dividend yield was approximately 7%, which is impressive amongst gaming companies in the world.
