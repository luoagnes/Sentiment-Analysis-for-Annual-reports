during the year, five large, highly efficient coal-fired generation units were put into operation, resulting in an increase in the total attributable operating generation capacity of 3,360 mw while three small units of total attributable generation capacity of 440 mw were shut down.
due to a slowdown in power consumption, rapid growth in hydropower generation and other factors, the average utilisation hours for coal-fired generation units in china decreased by 410 hours or 8.7% year on year. our subsidiary coal-fired generation units, which were fully operational during the year, had 4,989 hours of average full-load equivalent utilisation hours, exceeding the national average by 660 hours. this was because most of our subsidiary power plants comprise of highly efficient large generation units, and are mainly located in areas with relatively strong demand for electricity, thus having certain market advantages.
(2) renewable energy we continued to increase our investment in renewable energy projects and promote renewable development. in 2015, our approved wind power capacity and filed photovoltaic power capacity amounted to 2,920 mw and 280 mw, respectively.
as at the end of 2015, our attributable operational generation capacity in wind power, gas, hydropower and photovoltaic power totalled 4,611 mw, accounting for approximately 13.3% of our total attributable operational generation capacity and representing an increase of 0.8 percentage point versus the end of 2014. our wind power generation capacity and photovoltaic power generation capacity under construction was 1,415 mw and 130 mw, respectively.
our wind farms are mainly located in eastern, central and southern china, regions with less curtailment issues. the average full-load equivalent utilisation hours of our wind farms which were operational for the whole year was 1,988 hours, exceeding the national average by 260 hours.
(3) coal-mining business in 2015, our subsidiary and associate coal mines produced a total of 13.90 million tonnes of coal, representing an increase of 19.3% from 2014, of which 12.02 million and 1.88 million tonnes were produced by our subsidiary coal mines and associate coal mines, respectively.
due to the slowdown in china s economic growth, in particular the manufacturing sector, as well as the economic transition and industrial restructuring in the country, coal prices continued to drop. in response, we adopted a one-mine, one policy on our subsidiary coal mines. in 2015, we shut down four mines that had low production levels and four mines had ceased operation, which reduced our production capacity by approximately 0.48 million tonnes. at the same time, we further strengthened the production and cost management of our coal mines.

we have been striving to create value for shareholders. in 2015, in face of the complex and changing economic and market conditions, we persisted with the principle of development with integrity to adapt to the new economic trend. adhering to core elements of business development of centering around the 5m strategic objectives i.e., more solid, much stronger, much larger, much better and more sustainable , we operated our business in compliance with laws and in good faith. we strengthened and optimised the risk management system and established an effective and efficient operation system. by implementing lean management, benchmarking management and synergistic strategies in all business sectors, we enhanced the general management and operational efficiency and resulted in historical high major financial indicators of revenue, operating cash flows and net generation coal consumption rate in 2015, complementing the sustainable growth of the company.
