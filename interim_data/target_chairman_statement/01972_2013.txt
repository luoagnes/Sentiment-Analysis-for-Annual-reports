the increase in adjusted underlying profit from hk$4,372 million in 2011 to hk$6,932 million in 2012 principally reflects a contribution of hk$1,834 million from property trading. underlying profits from property investment also increased. this reflected positive rental reversions in hong kong, improved performance at sanlitun village and the first full year contribution from the taikoo hui development, offset in part by the loss of rental income following the disposal of festival walk and pre-opening expenses at indigo. despite improved performances from the managed and non-managed hotels in hong kong, the hotel operations recorded a lower underlying profit due to pre-opening expenses at the mandarin oriental in taikoo hui and east, beijing at indigo.
gross rental income was hk$9,015 million in 2012 compared to hk$8,557 million in 2011.
there were positive rental reversions in the hong kong office portfolio throughout the year.
occupancy levels remained high despite a slowdown in leasing activity. demand for retail space in hong kong continued to be robust during 2012.
in mainland china, the taikoo hui development in guangzhou made its first full year rental contribution in 2012, after its completion in the second half of 2011. net rental contributions from sanlitun village improved from 2011, reflecting active management of the tenant portfolio, cost reductions and capital expenditure designed to enhance footfall and circulation.
the significant profits from property trading principally arose from the completion of the sale of 98 units at the azura residential development in hong kong.
net finance charges were hk$1,367 million, a 7.5% decrease from hk$1,477 million in 2011.
the decrease reflected interest income received from a loan to our joint venture partner at the daci temple development in chengdu, a lower finance charge arising from the movement in the fair value of a put option held by the owner of the non-controlling interest at sanlitun village, beijing and lower finance charges in hong kong due to lower average borrowing levels, partially offset by higher net finance charges in mainland china on borrowings incurred to fund capital expenditure at sanlitun village, beijing and taikoo hui, guangzhou.

we are cautious about the outlook for office properties in hong kong in 2013. demand from financial services companies for office space in central is likely to remain soft, although rents at pacific place are expected to prove resilient due to high occupancy.
at island east, rents are expected to remain robust owing to very high occupancy and despite slower growth in the second half of 2012, the hong kong retail market is expected to continue to benefit from local economic growth and from tourists from mainland china.
demand for retail space, particularly at prime locations, continues to be strong. rents are expected to continue to increase.
demand for office space and rental rates are expected to remain stable in mainland china in 2013. there has been some reduction in consumer confidence and lower growth in spending in mainland china, but retailers of internationally branded goods in the few high quality shopping malls remain popular. retail rents are expected to be steady in 2013.
profits from property trading in hong kong are expected to be lower in 2013 than in 2012, but nevertheless significant, with the completion of the argenta development and the expected sale of the remaining units at the azura development. the effect of substantial increases and other changes in hong kong stamp duty on demand for luxury residential properties is uncertain. in the u.s.a., the residential market in downtown miami is expected to continue to improve gradually in 2013. excess condominium supply has been largely absorbed and new condominium developments are being built.
in 2013, the hotel operations will benefit from the fact that east, beijing will be in operation for its first full year and from a contribution from the mandarin oriental in taikoo on behalf of the shareholders and my fellow directors, i wish to express our appreciation to all our employees, whose commitment and hard work have been central to our hong kong, 14th march 2013
