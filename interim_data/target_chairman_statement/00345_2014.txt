commitment to quality and innovation consumers are changing their habits, preferences and consumption patterns with intensified focus on health and wellness. we are committed to keeping pace with the needs of our consumers and creating value added products for them. innovation remains our primary driver of growth. building on our tradition in providing affordable nutrition to the masses, we are poised to benefit from increasing consumer demand for natural ingredients and plant-based nutrition. we will adhere to our uncompromising philosophy in quality standard with food safety being the paramount in our mind.
building a strong team over the years, it is the passion, resilience and talent of our staff that have made our progress possible. during the year under review, we conducted an employee engagement survey in hong kong and mainland china with enthusiastic response rates from our staff. our colleagues have a high regard for the company and culture.
to nurture and grow our colleagues, enabling them to lead the company into the future, we have embarked on a talent management and succession planning program since 2009. we had a total of eight new management trainees from hong kong and mainland china joining the company last year for a comprehensive job attachment across different departments to equip them for future supervisory positions. we also launched the first technical trainee program in hong kong in 2013 to develop an internal pool of technical specialists in food and beverage manufacturing operations.
growing business sustainably we are committed to sustainability. it is our policy to purchase certified organic or non-genetically modified (non-gm) soybeans in every market where we operate.
we currently have contract farming operations in mainland china to supply us quality non-gm and organic soybeans. we will continue to identify appropriate new sources of supply and look for means to support farmers livelihoods by building long-term relationship that assure demand, promote knowledge sharing and encourage appropriate investment for a sustainable supply.
in addition, we seek to reduce the environmental impact of our operations with a focus on conserving and using renewable resources as well as finding innovative ways to recycle or reuse energy from our operations. we will continue to upgrade our machinery to improve the line efficiency and launch energy saving programs, such as heat recycling and recovery system, to help reduce the consumptions and to conserve resources in our plants.
we also actively engage in the communities in which we operate and help promote healthy lifestyle. throughout the year, we have participated in over 110 community events such as famine camps in hong kong and malaysia, and donated vitasoy products to charitable organisations including food banks to help alleviate hunger and poverty worldwide.
the year ahead it is our determination to continue to grow the group s profitability and build shareholder value over the long term. the outlook for the global macroeconomic growth remains mixed. commodity price increases will continue to bring challenges to our cost structure. meanwhile, there is a strong and growing environmental consciousness around the world on water consumption, waste disposal and energy usage. more consumers are strong advocates of health needs and their voices are easily heard via different channels such as the social media.
the combination of these shifts requires us to continually assess our operations. nevertheless, the demand for good-for-you products presents us with category growth opportunities. our brands are trusted in every market where we operate. with an unwavering commitment to our fundamentals of quality, innovation, infrastructure and people, we are confident that we can be more responsive in mastering the complexities of our operating environment and outperform the market.
