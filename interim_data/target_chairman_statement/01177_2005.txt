the chinese pharmaceutical market experienced steady growth in 2004. although the prc government continued to impose stringent measures towards the drug pricing and promotions campaigns, together with the widespread use of drug tendering system, the growing demand of the country s 1.3-billion population, the increasing rural-urbanisation and the new village-cooperative medical system (the system was launched in january 2003, of which designed to provide comprehensive medical insurance coverage to the entire rural population by 2010) have collectively created abundant growth opportunities in the prc pharmaceutical market. the promising market also brought up rural pharmaceutical market a rising star in the industry.
