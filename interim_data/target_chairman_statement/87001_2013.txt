beijing s retail market was active in 2012. many international retailers were eager to capture the opportunities in the enormous china consumption market.
leasing momentum at the malls at oriental plaza remained strong. during the year, we have carried out asset enhancement works and tenant mix refi nement exercises to capitalise on the business opportunities arising from the fast-changing retail environment.

offi ce portfolio beijing, the capital of china, remained a preferred city for international and domestic corporations, as well as overseas government bodies to establish their headquarters or regional quarters. we continued to see an imbalance between supply and demand for high quality offi ces in beijing, which was the key driver for rental growth in 2012.

in addition to grand hyatt beijing, the 590-room sheraton shenyang lido hotel has been integrated into hui xian reit s hotel portfolio since 1 january 2012. the average room rate per night increased 4.3% year-on-year to rmb 821. revpar was rmb 522. the average occupancy rate for 2012 was 63.6%.

as the management contract with sheraton ended on 31 december 2012, the manager appointed france s sofi tel luxury hotels as the new hotel manager. the hotel was renamed sofi tel shenyang lido on 1 january 2013.
strong financial position hui xian reit maintained a healthy balance sheet during the reporting period. as at 31 december 2012, bank balances and cash on hand amounted to rmb 2,063 million and gross debts amounted to rmb 1,964 million. debts to gross asset value ratio was 5.0%. we believe that hui xian reit has strong fi nancial capacity to pursue investment opportunities when they occur.

looking ahead to 2013, we are committed to driving organic growth from our assets through astute asset management. our priorities are to achieve rental growth, as well as to maintain high occupancy levels for all of our four business sectors: retail, offi ce, serviced apartment and hotel. this would provide us with the security of a strong and sustainable rental income.
we will continue to implement the asset enhancement programmes for grand hyatt beijing and the malls at oriental plaza in 2013. a renovation programme has also been initiated for sofi tel shenyang lido.
as we are actively seeking acquisition opportunities in china, we remain of the view that it is crucial to adopt a prudent selection strategy when pursuing quality and yield-accretive assets that are to bring long-term benefi ts for hui xian reit and unitholders.

the positive gdp performance and other economic data indicate that china s economy remains strong and the upward momentum is expected to continue in 2013. we fi rmly believe that china s economic fundamentals are sound and it will maintain the position as the key engine of global economic growth. we are confi dent that hui xian reit, with its high quality portfolio in excellent locations, solid track record, and expertise, is well positioned to capitalise on china s bright prospects.
on behalf of the manager, i would like to take this opportunity to thank the trustee and unitholders for their continued support and confi dence in hui xian reit.
