emerging economies faced the twin pressures of tempered growth and rising infl ation. international trade lost steam and international fi nancial markets fl uctuated drastically. china continued to transform its development model and the national economy maintained its smooth and rapid growth. however, there are still some obvious problems arising from unbalanced, uncoordinated and unsustainable economic development, even if china s long-term prospects are promising. the bank responded to these pressures by strictly adhering to a scientifi c outlook on development and fully implementing the state s macroeconomic policies, regulatory requirements and our own strategic development plan. the bank brought to life our principles of streamlining structure, scaling up, managing risks and sharpening competitiveness and pushed forward innovative, transformative and cross-border development. thus the bank recorded outstanding operating results.
