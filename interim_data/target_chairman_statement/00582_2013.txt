accordingly, the directors strived to improve the business operations and financial position of the group by proactively seeking potential investment opportunities that could diversify its existing business portfolio and broaden its source of income, and enhance value to the shareholders of the company.
since 2011, the property market in the prc have experienced a minor correction with surge in property prices being slowed down and decrease in transaction volume due to the austerity measures, including restriction on home purchase, imposed by the prc government. such correction resulted in a slowdown in the property market in the short term, but it helped curbing speculative activities which should be beneficial to the market in the long run. according to china and major cities real estate market report in 2012 # (2012 -n w ;n w ?b 0w "u 4x n f 1x) published by china index academy, there are recent signs of bottoming out as the total sales of property in 1st-tier cities and 2nd-tier cities during the year 2012 have increased by 24.04% and 39.32%, respectively, comparing to 2011 after the people s bank of china announced the interest rate cut. the directors believe that such monetary loosening policy is likely to continue and expect that the prc property market will begin to strong economic growth has been observed in yueyang, being a 3rd- tier city in the prc, mainly due to the development of infrastructure and completion of railway and expressway projects. in line with the economic growth, the disposable income per capita and urbanization rate in yueyang have also recorded persistent increase over the past decade. therefore, it is expected that the favorable outcome of these figures will drive the domestic demand for luxurious residential districts in yueyang as disposable income and urbanization rates are both key drivers of the property market.
