business and outlook
2008 was an eventful year. at the beginning of the year, we established another milestone in our history as we began full-time digital terrestrial tv broadcasting service in hong kong. a year later, we now provide a total of five digital terrestrial tv channels, covering over 75% of the population in hong kong.
we witnessed in may 2008 the tragic earthquake in sichuan, which brought about over 400,000 casualties and made millions homeless. as of today, the pictures of the disaster are still vivid in our mind. soon after the disaster struck, we mobilised our forces and helped organise a number of fund raising events on our channels in hong kong and overseas. the responses were over-whelming and heart warming, and we are grateful to the donors for their kindness.
then in august 2008, we celebrated the long-awaited beijing 2008 olympic games with pride and a sense of achievement. tvb once again made history by delivering round-the-clock high definition tv coverage with surround sound, rewarding our audience with real life experience of the events.
problems associated with financial institutions worldwide which began to surface in the second half of 2008 has rapidly led to a global economy downturn.
our business has been adversely affected as advertising income, a major revenue source in hong kong, began to decline, negating the growth in the earlier parts of the year. on the other hand, business in our overseas markets was less severely affected, as our licensing and subscription model helped deliver a relatively steady revenue stream.
our total costs increased in 2008, as a result of the launch of new digital channels and other special projects such as the beijing olympics. going forward, we shall vigilantly control operating and capital costs to reduce the adverse impact on our bottom line while exploring new revenue sources.
our belief in maintaining a continuous supply of quality programmes for terrestrial tv channels and international distribution remains. we will, therefore, continue to dedicate our efforts to investing in our future business for growth and, at the same time, to reinforce our position in the market.
lastly, on behalf of the board, i sincerely wish to thank all our stakeholders for their endorsement and support to the group.
