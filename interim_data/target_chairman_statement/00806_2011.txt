2011 is the first year of china s 12th five-year plan, during which strong initiatives will be taken to transform the country s economic model, from an export-led model to one that pushes domestic consumer spending and improvement of china s environment and living standards. the government in beijing remains pro-business and pro-growth but it is sensitive to any threat to stability. in this context, officials have put inflation at the top of their worry list, and they are also keeping an anxious eye on global political and economic developments, for fear of any spillover effects on china.
not surprisingly, we find the chinese investment environment for 2011 quite challenging. for the serious, long-term investor, promising opportunities remain on offer, but these have to be carefully identified through bottom-up research.
on the whole, the china story remains intact, with economic growth still pretty strong, projected at 9% for 2011, down just a bit from 2010 s estimated 10%.
our overall corporate objective is for value partners to be a temple of value investing for the asia-pacific region.
progress has been strong, and further initiatives will be taken. we want to be a world class asset management institution, not only in terms of our investment team s proven ability and resources, but also in terms of the firm s overall branding, infrastructure and support systems. what we build need to endure over the long term.
finally, we again express our deepest gratitude and appreciation to clients, employees and shareholders.
