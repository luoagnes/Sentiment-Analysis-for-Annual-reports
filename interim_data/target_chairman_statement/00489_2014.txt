secondly, the sales of japanese-brand vehicles affected by the diaoyu islands incident in september 2012 revived gradually to the pre-incident level as at the end of 2013, which stabilized the overall market and boosted its growth.
thirdly, as the general economic situation has bottomed out and stabilized, the commercial vehicles market maintained steady growth. customers purchased commercial vehicles in advance of the implementation of the state iv emission standards. fourthly, the rapid growth of various market segments, including the suv, mpv and heavy truck markets, further boosted the growth of the whole industry, and these market segments will continue to maintain their growth rates above the average industry level.

as the amendment to the international financial reporting standards in relation to joint venture arrangement has taken effect since 2013, the group adopted equity method for joint ventures instead of proportionate consolidation method to consolidate the joint ventures when preparing the consolidated fi nancial statement for the year beginning on or after 1 january 2013. for the convenience of the shareholders and investors to read and understand its fi nancial data, the group will disclose certain fi nancial data of joint ventures and simulation of fi nancial data using the proportionate consolidation method in this annual report and subsequent annual reports, except the fi nancial report. in accordance with the revised accounting standard, the sales revenue of the group for 2013 was approximately rmb37,263 million, representing an increase of approximately 511.9% as compared with the restated fi gures of the corresponding period of 2012. based on the proportionate consolidation method, the sales revenue of the group for the year would be approximately rmb161,253 million, representing an increase of approximately 30.0% as compared with the corresponding period of last year, and the sales revenues of passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles were approximately rmb116,539 million and rmb43,191 million, representing increases of approximately 21.3% and 61.0% as compared with the corresponding period of last year, respectively. in 2013, profi t attributable to shareholders was approximately rmb10,528 million, representing an increase of approximately 15.8% as compared with the corresponding period of last year.
