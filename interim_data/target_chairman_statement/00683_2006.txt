ii. logistics network kerry logistics network limited, the group s logistics division, recorded net profi t attributable to shareholders of hk$1,085 million during the year, representing an increase from hk$438 million in 2004.
the logistics division carried out extensive expansion plans in 2005. in thailand, we completed the construction of an 800,000 square-feet inland container depot in siam seaport, located near laem chabang, south of bangkok.
in europe, we expanded our operations to spain and also acquired two local companies in the united kingdom engaged in various logistics services. we entered an agency agreement with lynden international, a us-based company with offi ces in the united states, canada, mexico and puerto rico, to develop trans-pacifi c freight forwarding businesses.
in mainland china, a major milestone was marked for the division after our acquisition of a 70% equity interest in eas international transportation ltd., now renamed kerry eas logistics limited ( keas ). established for over 20 years with over 120 offi ces serving over 1,100 cities throughout mainland china, keas is now one of the leading logistics operators in mainland china. furthermore, with the completion of a 173,000 square-feet bonded logistics centre in tianjin s free trade zone in 2005 along with others strategically located in the free trade zones of yantian, beijing and shanghai s waigaoqiao, we now have a bonded logistics centre portfolio of over 1 million square feet in total.

the division recorded net profi t attributable to shareholders of hk$38 million in 2005 (2004: hk$31 million), which is mainly attributable to its investment in the western harbour crossing in hong kong. we will continue to focus on investment opportunities in the utilities, energy recycling and environmental protection-related sectors in mainland china to generate recurrent income for the group.

mainland china s economy demonstrated a robust performance in 2005, with gdp growth of 9.9%, a strong export sector and low domestic infl ation. we believe this strong performance will continue in 2006. the introduction of the state council s land tender policies has meant increased transparency and better accessibility for foreign investors to acquire land in mainland china. we believe that the central and provincial governments will continue to invest in more quality infrastructure and allocate more resources to the rural areas, as 2006 marks the fi rst year of the central government s eleventh five-year plan. under such an economic environment, we expect strong liquidity and increased affordability, fuelling the local demand for similarly, hong kong experienced a year of strong growth.
with gdp growth of 7.6%, infl ation maintained at 1% and an overall increase in wage levels, hong kong s property market experienced a rise in demand. our outlook for 2006 remains positive; this is primarily due to the aforementioned sustainable economic growth of mainland china, hong kong s niche in the trade and fi nancial services sectors and its booming tourism industry. the market s expectation of an end to the interest rate hikes will also have a positive effect on the property sector.
on the logistics front, we aim to widen our global client base and to enhance our international profi le. we will continue to venture into new markets such as india, the middle east and other parts of europe, in search of strategic alliances and investments to expand our business network. we will continue to invest in advanced technology for our logistics operations as we believe that technological innovation is paramount in maintaining our competitive advantage in in line with our mission statement of aspiring to excellence , we will continue to develop a portfolio of premium assets in the property, logistics and infrastructure sectors. with a positive economic outlook for 2006, the group will participate in development opportunities which we believe not only benefi t the communities we invest in, but also offer optimal fi nancial returns to the group and to on behalf of the board, i would like to express my sincere appreciation to the group s management and staff for their diligence, loyalty and dedication. i am grateful to the members of the board for their valuable counsel and guidance, as well as to our investors and strategic partners for their unfailing support and confi dence which has ultimately contributed towards the group s success.
