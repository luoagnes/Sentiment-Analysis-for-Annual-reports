economic transformation and structural adjustment the 12th five-year plan period is a critical one for china s transformation of its economic development pattern and structural adjustment. the fi nancial services industry is dependent on and supportive of the economy.
during the economic transformation period, the bank must actively respond to the rapidly changing regulatory environment and market trend, maintain good reform momentum and create vitality for business operation. we aimed at optimising our resource allocation, enhancing effi ciency and supporting our social development through the process of the bank s own transformation and structural adjustment. as a large commercial bank, we are fully aware of the importance of banking reform and strived to make signifi cant progress in our business, to ensure a successful start of the 12th five-year plan .
our role in supporting the economy will never change. we carefully implemented the national macroeconomic policies of our government and optimised our credit structure, with increased fi nancing support to strategic emerging industries, energy conservation and environmental protection projects, technology and innovation, and cultural and modern service industries. furthermore, we promoted coordinated development of regional economy, and put in more efforts in supporting the three rural sector and micro and small enterprises. in 2011, total lending to encouraged sectors increased by 18.41% for the bank. the proportion of loans made to domestic small to medium and micro enterprises and central and western regions of china reached 39.39% and 27.8% respectively, with continuous drop in loans made to highly polluting energy-intensive sectors and sectors with redundant capacity.
the second reform of the bank in operation and management was launched. different from the first reform driven by the conversion to a shareholding bank followed by public offering, the second reform , which started in mid-year 2011, primarily focuses on management innovation, reshaping its strength as a large scale but fl exible fi nancial institution and internal transformation. with respect to the objectives, tasks and key focuses of the second reform , we conducted various bank-wide research and analysis. by pulling strength and wisdom of our employees, we reached consensus among all departments. in addition, we are delighted to see the preliminary results of our reform in the areas of organisational structure and performance evaluation refl ecting improvements made in the related systems.
our assets and income structure had been actively adjusted. while adjusting the lending structure, we continued to expand the asset-based business by strengthening our businesses in securities investment, treasury operation and structured fi nancing. we also increased the proportion of non-credit assets and operating profi t margin of non-credit funds. in driving the transformation of our profi t model, the bank carried out business innovation on value-added services and process reengineering for cost reduction. total net fee and commission income amounted to rmb19.549 billion for the year, representing an increase of 35.02% as compared with the prior year. rate of return on securities investment continued to be among the top of listed great attention had been paid in minimising capital consumption on business development. under the guidance and support from regulators, the bank took the opportunity of applying the internal-based ratings approach to expand the application of raroc (return on risk-adjusted capital). the results from developing our internal-based ratings approach have been embedded into the existing underwriting process.
in addition, we made continuous improvement in policies, framework, process and system of the internal capital adequacy assessment, and strived to reduce capital consumption in our business development.
meanwhile, the bank lead the various business lines towards the path of capital saving and promoted the transformation of development model from high to low capital consumption through expanding the reform of performance management system and strengthening its evaluation in economic capital.
enterprise risk management and internal control strengthening risk management and internal control is always the lifetime commitment to a commercial bank.
a small negligence could lead to possible major break-downs. currently, the effects of the global fi nancial crisis have not yet completely dissipated, but the fi nancial institutions in china have experienced fast growth in their loan portfolio for several years. we also saw signs of slowdown in the chinese economy, coupled with prudent monetary policy of the government, as well as innovation in risk management ideas and risk measurement tools for international banks. as a result of these multiple intervening factors, the banking industry in china is entering into a real test period of the quality of their development achieved from the previous years.
in 2011, the bank made continuous improvement in enterprise-wide risk management and strived to achieve complete coverage on policies, procedures and risk measures. we established the 1+3+2 and 1+2 risk management committee frameworks for the head offi ce and branches respectively. new risk management tools were introduced to improve effi ciencies of risk evaluations. we also actively pushed for the compliance with the new basel capital accord, developed a series of rules and regulations, and enhanced the application of risk measurement tools in the bank s management, structural adjustment and decision-making process. the bank fully complied with the internal control standards for enterprises and the related guidelines, with solid implementation of proper internal control system, as well as engaging a professional fi rm to carry out its internal control audit.
in particular, we closely monitored the changes in macroeconomic policies, industry regulations and market trends, with focuses on key risk areas. we aimed at keeping risks to a minimum level, and enhancing the applicability and forward-looking aspects of our risk prevention activities. on one hand, we placed high importance on loans made to high risk areas, such as the local government fi nancing platforms, real estate industries and customers associated with private lending. we also carried out bank-wide special risk investigations to further strengthen our credit and operational risk management. on the other hand, the bank actively responded to the tightened monetary policy and adopted an integrated approach to group management. the bank performed stress testing on liquidity gap and further strengthened its overall risk management capabilities in the risk areas of market, country, consolidation, reputation and information technology, etc.
as a result of our solid risk management undertakings, we achieved the reductions in both the non-performing loan balance and the non-performing loan (npl) ratio by the year-end, with the npl ratio dropped to 0.86%. the provision coverage ratio increased by 70.53 percentage points to 256.37%, as compared with the prior year. we are in full compliance with the carpals set by cbrc.

we will proactively align the bank s strategy with our national strategy, strive to improve our service quality and remain committed to support the economic transformation. we will continue to optimise our lending and asset structure to enhance our sustainable development capabilities by meeting the needs arising from industrial optimisation and upgrading, expansion of consumer consumption, and coordinated regional development, as well as seizing the opportunities brought by the rapid growth of new emerging industries.
while maintaining our credit income at a strong level and leveraging our strength via the bocom strategy , together with the special features of wealth management, we will continue to adjust our income structure by increasing revenue streams generated from non-credit businesses and its proportion to total income.
we will move forward with reforms of our system and structure to generate our intrinsic power for development. we will also push for the second reform . to ensure that our reform achieves the desired objectives, we will focus on key areas such as performance measurement, front offi ce structure and operational procedures, as well as product innovation and authorisation management. we will also continue to implement the integrated management strategy of the group, with improvements made to the one bank, one customer management system, as well as accelerating the establishment of the group management framework and mechanism across various operating units, profi t centres and business lines.
