coupled with mainland china s own internal policy measures, there have been corrections in the property market. as a result, the group has not acquired any sites for property development since august 2007.

however, the group is positive about the economic prospects of mainland china. the economic growth of china will continue despite some short- term adjustments. given the central government s recent stance to implement measures to boost economic growth as their top policy agenda, this is positive to the development of property market on the mainland over the medium to long term. the group s commitment to building quality properties and providing after-sales professional property management services have been the key factors in achieving customer satisfaction and we are committed to doing the same for projects in mainland china.

as at 30th june, 2008, the group has a total of 27.4 million square feet of land bank in china, of which 26.8 million square feet are development land bank and the remaining are completed properties for investment and for sale purposes.

management would like to take this opportunity to express our heartfelt sympathy to those who suffered profound loss in the sichuan earthquakes.
the group s projects in cheng hua district of chengdu and jiang bei district of chongqing were not affected by the earthquakes and no damage has been reported as the sites were bare land at that time. the central government s programme to rebuild the affected areas will induce more investment demand nationwide associated with reconstruction and other than the matters mentioned above, there has been no material change from the information published in the report and accounts for the financial year ended 30th june, 2007.

chairman s statement (continued) 22 sino land company limited annual report 2008 as at 30th june, 2008, the group s gearing was 20.9%, expressed as a percentage of bank and other borrowings net of cash and bank balances over shareholders equity. the decrease in gearing compared with that as at 30th june, 2007 was mainly due to the receipt of the sales proceeds from the sales of residential units in vision city, one silversea, houses in st. andrews place and receipts from sales of the palazzo as well as a share placement of 220 million new ordinary shares at hk$19.57 per share on 24th september, 2007. of the total borrowings, 25.9% was repayable within one year, 38.5% repayable between one and two years and 35.6% repayable between two and five years. the group s borrowings are subject to floating interest rates. the group, including the attributable share of its associates, had cash resources of approximately hk$13,742.2 million, comprising cash on hand of approximately hk$4,719.8 million together with committed undrawn facilities of approximately hk$9,022.4 million. all the cash on hand is in the form of deposits in banks of high credit ratings. total assets and shareholders funds of the group were hk$86.2 billion and hk$58.7 billion respectively.

there was no material change in foreign currency borrowings and the capital structure of the group for the financial year ended 30th june, 2008. foreign exchange exposure has been prudently kept at a minimal level.

the group places great significance on corporate integrity, business ethics and good governance. with the objective of achieving best practice of corporate governance, the group has established an audit committee, a compliance committee and a remuneration committee. the group is committed to maintaining good corporate transparency as well as good communication with investors and shareholders through various channels such as non-deal roadshows, investor conferences, results briefings, site visits and corporate website to disseminate information about the group s latest developments.

the group reaffirms its commitment to building quality projects. in keeping with its mission to enhance customer satisfaction, the group will wherever possible ensure that attractive design concepts and features, which are also environmentally friendly, are integral elements of its developments. management continues to conduct regular reviews of its properties and where necessary makes improvements to maintain its reputation for the highest standards of quality and service.

delivering high-quality customer service has long been one of the group s key business objectives. during the financial year ended 30th june, 2008, the group s sino property services received a number of awards from the hksar government and other respected organisations in recognition of its quality of service, management capability, contributions to the community and charitable services, and the promotion of environmental protection. the group will continue to make improvements in its quality of service so as to ensure customer satisfaction and chairman s statement (continued) sino land company limited annual report 2008 23 to further the group s commitment to good corporate citizenship, our community care committee (the committee ) works closely with different charitable and voluntary organisations to arrange various community services for the needy.

on the environmental protection side, the group has collaborated on projects with a number of international organisations from promoting environmental protection to co-organising activities to inspire public interest in protecting natural resources and encourage the concept of green living.

it is also the group s belief that supporting local arts and cultural activities is important to foster creativity, reinforce public awareness and encourage hong kong people s artistic appreciation. the committee will continue to roll out activities for staff participation as well as to serve the community in the years to the financial year 20072008 was indeed a challenging year. the impact of the price inflation of commodities has spread out to a range of industries. the consolidation of the us economy triggered by sub-prime issues, the housing market, a tightening of credit in financial markets and the problems in mortgage backed securities have affected the world economic growth in general. however, government authorities have responded in a timely manner with appropriate and decisive fiscal and monetary stimulus and other measures to foster confidence and to promote a return of the economy to a sustained path.

although there has been volatility in equity markets, continuous economic growth in mainland china, infrastructure developments both within hong kong and in pearl river delta region as well as hong kong s own economic fundamentals continued to drive the economic growth of hong kong. on the other hand, the challenging global economic climate has recently caused consolidation in residential property prices this year but such consolidation is considered a short-term adjustment within a long-term growth cycle. a short term adjustment in the residential property market will bring in a healthy and sustainable growth in the medium to long run.

notwithstanding the present global economic environment, the underlying macro economic environment in hong kong remains fundamentally sound with economic growth at a reasonably favourable level, the unemployment rate staying low and vibrant trade flows between hong kong and mainland china. furthermore, the negative real interest rate environment, a broad-based increase in payrolls partly balancing out inflation, mortgage rates at comparatively low levels, improvement in home purchase affordability are all positive indicators for the property market to grow in hong kong.

chairman s statement (continued) 24 sino land company limited annual report 2008 the budget of the hksar government for the fiscal year 200809 proposing a series of incentives focusing on the reduction of certain tax rates is conducive to alleviating the burden of tax-payers. investment in infrastructure developments including the new railway links of the west island line, the south island line and confirmation of the shatin to central link as well as the upgrading programme for the hong kong international airport are positives for the hong kong economy and property market. further, the proposed hong kong-zhuhai-macau bridge will further enhance economic links among these cities and to other mainland cities which will certainly benefit hong kong s economy. as the majority of the group s assets are in hong kong, the group is well positioned to gain from positive economic and property market factors.

china, asia s second largest economy, has shown signs of stabilising with inflation gradually contained as government measures have taken effect. central government has also indicated that the national economy under macroeconomic control measures is continuing to develop in their expected direction. there have been signs that maintaining economic growth is on top of the central government s economic policy agenda. prospects for the china s economy are good over the medium to long term.

the group continues to be prudently positioned to benefit from opportunities that will arise in the future and will strive to optimise earnings, improve the quality of its properties and services, and enhance customers lifestyles. the group will maintain a policy of selectively and continuously replenishing its land bank both in hong kong and china, which will enable it to strengthen earnings and profitability, and continue to deliver shareholder value. the directors are indeed confident in the medium to long term prospects of the group.

i would like to welcome mr. ringo chan wing kwong and mr. sunny yeung kwong who joined the board as executive directors with effect from 1st january, 2008 and 1st july, 2008 respectively.

on behalf of the board, i take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation to all staff for their commitment, dedication and continuing support. i would also like to express my gratitude to my fellow directors for their guidance and wise robert ng chee siong
