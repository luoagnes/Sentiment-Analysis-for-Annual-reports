2008 is a year of tremendous challenges to the property market of china. in the first half of the year, the property market entered the stage of consolidation with the implementation of a series of austerity measures; in the second half of the year, the sub-prime woe in the u.s. triggered a global financial crisis which resulted in the euro-american economies on the verge of recession. the economic growth in china also posted a slowdown in subsequent quarters with the negative impact of export curtailment, sluggish domestic consumption and investment setback. under unfavourable policies and economic doldrums, the china property market experienced a decrease in transaction volume and stagnation in price during the first half of the year. the situation in the second half worsened, with a drop in both transaction volume and selling price. in particular, transaction volume and selling price in major first and second-tier cities reduced by 30% to 50% and 20% to 40% when compared with that in the peak of for the year under review, property transaction volume in beijing significantly reduced and ranked the first among first- tier cities nationwide. chengdu s market was hit by the sichuan earthquake on 12th may 2008, which resulted in sluggish sales of commodity housing. as beijing and chengdu are two of the group s major strategic development regions, contracted sales area and contracted sales revenue recorded year-on- year decreases. despite the negative impact brought forth by weak market sentiment, tightening of credit policy and earthquake disaster, the group maintained a smooth progress in project construction and approximate construction floor area ( cfa ) amounted to 988,422 sq. m, with key projects such as the reflections, urban town, beijing a-z town, chengdu a- z town, tianjin butchart garden and wuxi gentle house completed and delivered in a progressive manner.

the overall market was at a low ebb and led to a slowdown in the sales volume. however, the selling price of the group s key projects in beijing, including the reflections, urban town and beijing a-z towns remained relatively stable. the group also proactively introduced various measures, adjusted sales strategy and enhanced customer service standard, so as to establish reputable market image and extensive client recognition, and to be well prepared for the next round of sales in peak season.

in view of the declining macro-economic environment, the central government reiterated the importance of property industry as a pillar industry of the chinese economy. in the fourth quarter of the year, the central government promulgated a range of policies and measures in order to boost residential property consumption and to stabilize the development of the property market, generating moderate results. urbanization and the growth of per capita income will remain as the momentum for the long term development of the property market. it is expected that the central and local governments will implement more policies that are favourable to the healthy development of the market.
