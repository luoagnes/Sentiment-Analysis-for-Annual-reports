in 2002, based on past experience, the group revised the gas management standards and extended their practice to all project companies to further improve the management and operation flow of the project companies.
in addition, after the national 24-hour customer services hotline 95158 being put into use at the 24 hours call centre in langfeng xinao last year, call centres also commenced operation in huludao xinao and liaocheng xinao this year.

as at the end of 2002, the group had 3,238 employees, representing an increase of 1.8 times compared to last year. it was mainly because the number of operating project companies increased from 12 to 25, most of them being larger in scale. the group s actual manpower resources maintained at the same level as last year when taking into account the fact that the connectable population of the group also increased by 1.8 times during throughout the year, the group looked for suitable candidates by various means. quite a few of senior executives were recruited, and most of them are middle and senior management staff from the industry with extensive professional knowledge and management experience. the recruitment of such executives helps the group to cope with its rapid expansion. the group also provides intensive internal training to build up a pool of the use of natural gas, a clean and efficient source of energy, is strongly promoted by the central government, and foreign investors are encouraged to invest in the downstream gas distribution market.
the west-to-east pipelines ( w-e ) extends from xinjiang to shanghai, passing through cities in 10 provinces, such as xinjiang, gansu and ningxia. the pipelines are approximately 4,200 kilometres long and with a designed annual capacity of 12 billion m 3 . the pipelines are expected to be operational by 2004. the construction of the pipelines commenced in july 2002 and has been progressing smoothly since then. recently, the construction has been extended into gansu. starting from 1 march 2003, the construction work in gansu has been in full swing, and a trial gas supply will begin in october 2003 in provinces like auhui, henan and jiangsu. this favours the development of our project companies within such on 27 december 2002, the ministry of construction of the prc issued a memorandum on the opinion concerning the speeding up of the development of market economy in the public utilities sector requiring local authorities to open up the market for the construction and operation of public utilities according to the situation in each place. this further ensures the liberalisation of the city gas market.
under such favourable environment, we believe that the group will be able to obtain new projects without much difficulty. it is expected that the group will still be able to secure six to eight new quality projects in large and medium cities in 2003. despite the huge market opportunities, we will remain prudent and conduct detailed feasibility study on each project before making any investment decision, so as to maximise shareholders
