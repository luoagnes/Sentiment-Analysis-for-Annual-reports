the economy of china maintained its rapid growth momentum in 2003, which, however, is associated with coal and electricity famine as a result of increasing demand for energy and deteriorating environment pollutions as well. in order to change the energy structure of the country that is over-dependant on coal, and to alleviate environmental pollutions, the chinese government decides to implement structural adjustment to energy supply by increasing the proportion of use of natural gas. the proportion of use of natural gas in respect of the energy consumption of china will increase from 2.5% in 2001 to 10% in 2010. as natural gas has been stipulated by chinese government as a kind of clean energy, the future of natural gas industry is promising. according to the statistics, the per capita consumption of natural gas of china in 2000 is 16 cubic meters, which is much lower than the international average level of 408 cubic meters. the use of natural gas in china is still at a low level. the chinese government has formulated measures to encourage the use of natural gas. it is anticipated that national consumption of natural gas will increase from 50 billion cubic meters at present to 96 billion cubic meters by 2010, and the national demand for natural gas will reach 200 billion cubic meters by 2020. among them, electricity generating and city gas account for most of the growth of use and it is expected that each will account for about one third of the total demand. to cope with the soaring demand for gas, china needs to introduce a great quantity of capital to build large-scale infrastructure, long distance pipelines, city distribution networks and related equipment. according to the estimates of the energy bureau of the national development and reform commission, the natural gas industry of china is in its historic period of rapid growth. in 2002 to 2020, the natural gas infrastructure construction of china requires total investment of more than rmb220 billion, which is mainly used in the building of natural gas pipelines of 50,000 km, 10 million ton-grade liquefied natural gas stations and million ton-grade transportation capability of liquefied natural gas. in light of the vast investment scale involved, the chinese government has formulated favorable policies that encourage foreign investment in the construction and operation of projects relating to china natural gas risk exploration and development, gas pipelines, gas storage stations, natural gas power stations and city gas for large and medium cities. these policies are matched with complete law and regulations and a regulatory system for the natural gas industry, in order to establish a healthy market system that is characterized by separation of politics and enterprise, fair competition, open and orderly policies and forceful regulation and control, to form a more standardized investment environment. in particular, since the implementation of west-east pipeline project, the chinese government has in 0-nnlqqt w ytoc nwlnho 0 (regulations of the prc regarding land oil deposit exploitation in cooperation with 0-nnlqqt w ytocwm m wlnho 0 (regulations of the prc regarding petroleum resources in cooperation with foreign provisions on guiding foreign investment) and other related laws and regulations, liberalizing certain restrictions on foreign investment. the above policies enacted by the chinese government bring about enormous business opportunities for foreign investors participation in city gas projects.
the west-east pipeline project with an annual gas supply of 12 billion cubic meters is the chinese government s key project to fuel utilization of natural gas. by the end of 2003, the construction works of the eastern section of the project has completed and commenced commercial operation. in the middle of may 2004, wuhu joint venture company of the group has made gas connection to the west-east pipeline project, and has fully initiated switch to the use of natural gas in wuhu city. it is expected that the west- east pipeline project will be completed on all fronts by the end of 2004, and by that time clean natural gas will be available to the resident users and industrial and commercial users in nine provinces along the line.
gas from east sichuan project (the zhongwu pipeline project) with an annual gas supply of 3 billion cubic meters will also be completed by the end of 2004, and by that time natural gas will be available to resident users and industrial and commercial users in the two provinces, hunan province and hubei province. operating projects of the group locate mostly along the main pipelines of west-east pipeline and zhongwu pipeline. with the gas connection and ignition of the main pipelines, it is expected that all operations of the group will achieve greater development in the next financial year.
the financial year 2004 was undoubtedly a remarkable and fruitful year for the group. yet, it is a beginning and the group will continue to follow the growing path to expand the group s natural gas business. the directors are highly optimistic about the prospects of the business of the group. the group will still focus on investing in natural gas downstream business as well as other natural gas-related business that bring in steady income. as an ongoing course, we will continue to identify and invest in new quality projects in different regions of china. besides, we will constantly improve current operational efficiency, monitor the cost structure and advance the on behalf of the directors, i would like to express my sincere thanks to all of our staff, the management team and the fellow board members for their endeavors and dedication; to the shareholders, investors and bankers for their ongoing support and confidence. we will further the development of the group and have set the goal to maximize investment return for our june 25, 2004
