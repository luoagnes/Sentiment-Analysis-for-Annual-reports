on the back of a global economic downturn and subsequent it market slowdown, even chinas booming it market was adversely affected, experiencing reduced levels of growth in 2001. after several years of seeing the market develop at high speed, in which the group experienced surging market share and consistently excellent financial results, legend last year had to face a wholly different business environment which presented the new management team with major challenges. despite the unfavourable environment, the team approached their task with confidence, exploiting the difficult conditions by using them as a spur to readjust and reform the groups strategies for survival and growth. after a careful analysis of market conditions, the management team put into practice a number of measures designed to stabilise the market and sustain legends general economic health in the face of difficult conditions. these measures were successful in improving both the groups gross profit and net profit margins, and maintaining continuous growth in profits.
