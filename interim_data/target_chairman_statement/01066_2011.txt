the year 2010 was the toughest year in the history of the group. firstly, there was no major improvement in the delay of settlement from customers. it was necessary to strike a balance in terms of sales growth, resources allocation and selection of different product categories from time to time to ensure the balance between short-term interests and long-term development. secondly, the materials costs during the year were again increased significantly and the trend continues resulting in fairly low profit margin or loss making for majority of the conventional single use consumables.
the group continues to suppress such product sales so as to maintain a reasonable level of profit margin. it certainly has, to certain extent, had an impact on the growth in sales of conventional single use consumables. furthermore, during the year, the company faced drastic increase in labour cost and pressure in recruitment. due to the speed up of business expansion of multinational companies in china market and the listing of industry players which are in common business areas of that of the group in various capital markets, it has major impact on substantially speeds up the increase in salary and fringe benefits. the group considers that a stable working team is fundamental to the continuous development of the company. with this new market development in human resources, the group promptly adjusted the salary and the policy on fringe benefits to retain a stable working team. the group expects that continuous increase in labour costs and fringe benefits will be a major challenge.

looking forward to 2011, the group believes that materials and labour costs will continue to increase significantly, but with a lowered growth rate based on the huge surge in 2010. with the continuous increase of capital investment in the healthcare industry, the receivables collection should be eased to a certain degree when compared with 2010.
competition in talent recruitment will be further intensified and the continuous talents shortage situation will remain. on the basis of the significant improvement of the remuneration and welfare levels of production staff in 2010, the group will continue to face the pressure arising from the surge in remuneration and welfares for management, research and development, and sales staff in 2011. the shortage of conventional single use consumables and blood purification consumables production capacity will constraint further market development. the group will accelerate on product mix adjustment and technological improvement, as well as raising the production capacity of existing equipment to satisfy the demand of the current market. meanwhile, the group will speed up the relocation of new factories to fully relieve the pressure in production capacity. overall, 2011 will still be a tough year. the directors believe that the group will place emphasis on the following aspects in 2011: 1. continue to intensify more efforts on research and development of new products and product sales mix adjustment and consolidate the group s competitive position in the prc high-end market. the group will strengthen the medical staff training and the selection and consolidation of distributors in the middle- end market, thereby laying a solid foundation for the group s entry into the middle-end market after production capacity expansion in 2012.

2. continue to focus on domestic market. leverage on the stable development of domestic market to backup the long term process of developing and expanding overseas market. fully capitalise on the customer resource strengths in the prc high-end market, through international collaboration by ways of joint venture, co-operation, technology transfer, acquisitions and mergers, etc., thereby introducing technologies and further expanding product categories.
3. capitalize on the group s research and development strengths, continue to increase the investments in technological improvement, and increase automation with an objective of assimilating the rising labour cost and recruitment pressure in the long run. the group will speed up the study and implementation of the long term incentive scheme for employees to share the success of the group. the group will continue to offer competitive salary and fringe benefits packages to retain and expand the work force.
with the launching of more upgraded products and new product series, gradual expansion of production capacity and the entry into the middle-end market, the management believes that the group will continue to consolidate its leading position in the prc market. the group and its employees are confident to face new by leveraging on the group s in-depth knowledge of the domestic market and the application of advanced technology and the continued innovation in operation management, the group will continue to strengthen its professional management team. the group and its employees are confident to face new challenges.
