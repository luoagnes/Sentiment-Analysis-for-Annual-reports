in view of macro-economic structure adjustments and growth pattern changes, the group considers that the real estate industry, being the essential component of the economy, will inevitably face a higher requirement and its development will become more standardized and efficient. the promotion of the new urbanization and the continuous increase in income and purchasing power of the citizens will lead to enormous demand for the real estate market and offers promising prospect for meanwhile, we should also be aware that the development of the real estate industry is currently experiencing an in-depth transformation. it is obvious that china s macro-economic austerity measures have become a regular practice. the financing environment and channels are changing and market presents both opportunities and challenges. the industry showed an obvious trend of consolidation and a further concentration of the industry, as a result, industry competition became more and more diversified and multi-level. development strategy, management model, financing strategy as well as product innovation will become significant factors affecting the development of real estate enterprises in the future. the group will run in tandem with the development pattern of the industry, accommodate to the life cycle of the industry and pay close attention to the changes in industrial conditions.

3. eastern china yangtze river delta economic zone is regarded as an important hub in eastern china while shanghai is the group s core city which extends to the second-tier cities such as hangzhou and ningbo, and to the third- tier cities with vast development potential, namely kunshan, cixi and taicang. such strategy creates a reasonable business layout, where the first-tier cities in eastern china play complementary roles with the second- and third-tier cities. in 2012, with the introduction of high quality projects in the region, the group s business proportion and market share in the region have both increased, rendering it an important stronghold for the group s future business growth, contributing 41% of the group s result for the year.
shanghai, an international economic and financial center, is on the path of becoming an international metropolitan and a world city. this will not only improve its overall competitiveness, but also increase its radiating and driving forces to the cities around the yangtze river delta. in 2012, shanghai achieved steady economic development, regional gdp of the whole year reached rmb2,010.133 billion, which rose 7.5% from last year. disposable income per capita was rmb40,188, up 10.9% year-on-year.

in 2012, the group spared no effort to extend its strategic business coverage in eastern china. as the projects in the second- and third-tier cities such as ningbo, kunshan and taicang progressively mature, their contribution to the sales performance of the group will become more significant.
2. prospects of the prc real estate sector looking ahead to 2013, the domestic economy will continue to focus on seeking progress amidst stability and carrying out reform and transformation, while perking up the quality and efficiency of economic growth will be the focal points. driven by long-standing mechanism such as domestic demand expansion and urbanization construction, the macro economy will sustain its steady growth. in 2013, the real estate industry will continue to encounter control measures which have developed into normal practices. under such circumstance, restraining investment and speculative demand will become a long-term target, while reasonable consumption demand arising from residential needs and improvement of living condition will be encouraged. the china s central economic work conference 2013 stated that we will embark on a new path of urbanization, where the focus of urbanization will shift from rapid advance to quality concern , which will also impose higher requirements for the development of real estate industry.
it is expected that in 2013, china will continue to implement proactive financial policy and solid currency policy; the control measures on the real estate industry will not change in the short term. rational consumption demand will be the main pillar of real estate market and real estate speculation will be curbed by repressive measures continuously. the control measures have accelerated the maturity of the real estate industry. in the future, emerging business sectors such as real estate financing, pension real estate and industrial real estate will develop progressively, and their associated value with traditional residential and commercial properties will continuously emerge, resulting in the further expansion and emergence of value chains in the real estate 3. prospects of the group since 2012, the pattern of economic growth has continued to change. while constantly promoting the reform of the economic system, the government has also strived to ensure the balance, coordination and sustainability of the national economic development. in 2013, it is expected that the government will not waver in control of the real estate industry. various measures will be deepened which will ultimately perfect the control system of the real estate market. nevertheless, considering the continuous increase in consumption power of the general public and the further deepening of urbanization on the basis of the twelfth five- year plan , the group holds a prudently optimistic view towards the real estate market.
the group will continue to perfect its monitoring system, strengthen its risk awareness and optimize its internal management, so as to respond to the changes and challenges of the internal and the external markets. besides, the group will consider raising investment return as its highest goal, further balance its business structure, improve its product quality in order to meet market demand so as to achieve continuous and steady growth of the group s results.
perfecting the control system and strengthening the the group keeps perfecting its control system and optimizing its management structure in a scientific and highly efficient manner.
we also endeavore to raise internal management standard in order to deal with the complicated market changes in china and overseas. meanwhile, the group s informatization and systematic project constructions were strengthened and work procedures and business flows were shortened through perfecting the management structure system, which eventually improve our executive capability and ability to deal with changes.
integrating the investment structure to ensure considering the current control policies mainly target at the residential market, and in order to adapt to the market changes, the group will ensure the continued increase in sales volume of residential property and at the same time enlarge the investments in commercial property, industrial property and tourism property.
couples with financial investments, the group will guarantee the maximization of return rate per unit of area through strong and solid profitability. this diversified operating approach will on one hand spread the risk exposure of the group, and on the other hand will facilitate the group to balance its investment structure and maximize its revenue. this approach will not only optimize the group s investment structure, but also ultimately guarantee the group s financial security, which in turn provides strong guarantee for the group s long-term and stable operational development.
