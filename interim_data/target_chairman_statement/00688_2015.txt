1. business review the global economy remained complicated and fast changing in 2014. there was more favourable economic development in the united states, with improved employment. the eurozone was stagnant, triggering concerns about a new wave of european debt crisis. economic development in japan showed little improvement, even with mega quantitative easing measures; geopolitical problems in the middle east, europe and asia elevated risks in the global economy; a strong dollar coupled with a possible move to increase interest rate led to clear signs of capital outflows from emerging markets, thus increasing the risks of an economic downturn.
against the background of volatile economic environment and sluggish economic growth abroad, the chinese central government promulgated several measures for stabilising growth, including increased investment in infrastructure, moderately eased monetary policies for liquidity improvement, and a lending rate reduction in november the first in more than two years. china s foreign trade showed no sign of improvement, while the cpi and ppi continued to drop. weak momentum in the economy resulted in an annual economic growth rate of 7.4%, meeting the target of about 7.5%. the economic slowdown in europe, the united states and china meant there was only mild economic growth in hong kong and macau.
in the first half of 2014, the slowdown in china s economic growth, the tightening of liquidity and credit due to financial reforms, and the cutthroat sales arising from property businesses facing less favourable financial conditions and attempting to clear inventory, combined to result in a significant shrinkage of both house prices and trading volume, coupled with passive sentiment in the land market. the property sector strengthened gradually in the second half of the year, with notable improvements in sales prices and though facing a market environment encountering pressure from economic downturn and tight liquidity, the group achieved satisfactory growth in its sales and profits in 2014. turnover increased by about 45.5% to hk$120.00 billion, and net profits increased by 21.7% to hk$28.21 billion for the year. the profit attributable to the equity shareholders of the company increased by 20.1% to hk$27.68 billion, with hk$3.85 billion of profit after tax related to the increase in the fair value of the investment property portfolio. the group hence recorded an increase of 25.6% in its core profit (meaning net profits after deducting net income related to the increase in fair value of the investment properties and non-recurrent net income) to hk$23.83 billion. the board is pleased to report to shareholders of the company that the consolidated net profit of the company increased by more than 20% in each of the past 12 years (2003 2014). over the past five years (2010 2014), the net profit attributable to shareholders has increased at a compound growth rate of 29.3% per annum, while the average return on shareholders funds in 2014, the target for contracted property sales which was set at hk$140 billion at the beginning of the year, was exceeded, setting another record high.
