2015 market review and group following the trend in 2014, profound changes in china s real estate industry continued in 2015. as china s economy went into a new norm and policies for the real estate industry still aimed at encouraging consumption and de- stocking , numerous beneficial policies were rolled out. to boost demand for commodity housing, the central government reduced interest rates, required reserve ratio and deposit for personal home mortgage several times.
transaction tax for second-hand properties was also reduced. local authorities lowered the purchase threshold by adjusting the policies for provident funds and household registration and offered deed tax allowance and cash subsidy. on the supply side, both the central government and local authorities rolled out policies to optimize land supply, regenerate existing stock, allow conversion of finished commodity housing to settlement housing or public housing to speed up supply-side reforms .
as more favorable policies were announced, the property market was in a relaxed status never seen before. as market confidence returned, sales volume of commodity housing in china recorded high last year. data from the national bureau of statistics of china indicated that total sales of commodity housing in china in 2015 was rmb8,728.1 billion, not only exceeded that in 2014 (14.4% increase year- on-year) but also in 2013 (7.2% increase year-to-year), reaching the highest in history. total gfa of commodity housing sold was 1.285 billion sq.m., a 6.5% increase year- on-year compared to that in 2014 but 1.6% lower than in despite a record high sales volume, the imbalance in supply and demand was still a serious problem for the industry as stock of commodity housing also reached a new height.
data from the national bureau of statistics of china showed that the gfa of commodity housing ready to be sold at the year end of 2015 was 718 million sq.m, 15.6% more than that in the end of the year before and at a record high. gfa ready to be sold increased faster than growth rate of gfa sold. besides, total investment in property development in china grew 1% to rmb9,597.9 billion only in 2015 compared to the previous year, a record low growth rate but still high in amount. as a result of over-development in the past years, there was enormous pressure in shifting stock in differentiation of the property market also intensified. the strong consumption capacities of first-tier cities and some prosperous second-tier cities contributed to the strong market demand, coupled with the easing policies of the government, housing prices stayed high for the year. third and fourth-tier cities and some less prosperous second-tier cities, despite the increase in their trade volume, were still under considerable pressure from the high stock level, as a result, housing prices remained stable or slightly declined.
home prices in 100 major cities released by the china index academy showed that accumulated growth in home prices in the past year was 4.15%, among which, the growth in first-tier, second-tier and third-tier cities were 17.2%, 0.53% and -1.09% respectively. disparity between different regions and tiers continued to widen with major property developers increasingly focusing on first-tier and major second-tier in view of new developments of the real estate industry, numerous property developers made attempts in new business sectors and upgrade. on the one hand, they actively cultivated the traditional business to extend both up and down-streams, as well as created new products and business models to raise profitability. on the other hand, they explored opportunities in related areas to seek profit growth and to go towards becoming a conglomerate.
2016 market outlook under the new norm of stable growth in china s macro economy in 2016, the real estate industry is still challenged by continued stockpiling, sluggish investment and lower profitability. differentiation of market will carry on while companies continue to focus on de-stocking and encouraging spending. upgrading and transformation of companies, mergers and acquisitions, restructuring and elimination of weaker players will all be intensified.
in 2016, policies for the real estate industry will continue to relax. the central government clearly outline the objective of removing the over-piling stock, facilitating the real estate industry development. in the short-term, the monetary policy can be further flexible while reforms in the household registration system and land system will beef up urbanization and further encourage demand. driven by de-stocking and supply-side reform, the property market will remain stable.
total sales in the year both in terms of gfa and amount will be similar to last year. when the pressure of stock is eased and supply is adjusted, price in general is expected to be stable or even looking up. differentiation among cities, however, remains. economic outlook in first and major second-tier cities is comparatively stronger as they are able to attract mobility. these cities have the potential to drive up property price and thus are more favored by developers.
restrained by high stock level, third and fourth-tier cities will continue to encourage transactions with favorable prices to in the silver era, it is commonly acknowledged by the industry that changes and reforms are necessary. the golden era for property development being the principal business is in the past. real estate based financing, customer services and internet + are all emerging.
companies are competing on different platforms and are all taking on new challenges of reinvention and new ventures.
industry competition will be more fierce and diverse in the coming future. to secure a better future, developers can only follow with the trend and reinvent themselves, develop new business models and ideas for profit growth, and embrace a diversified development.
our strategy in 2016 in view of the new circumstances and changes in the industry, our group will adhere to the objectives and requirements set by the fourth phase of strategic development. we will work according to the principles of optimizing our location planning, offering new products, enhancing services and co-operating with shareholders to ensure quality, sustainable and steady growth.
