in 2011, our strategy of focusing on the development of our core consumer businesses continued to pay off as we have further consolidated the leading positions of each of our core businesses of retail, beer, food and beverage in china. for instance, our multi-format retail chain has been a leading retail chain group in china, with its turnover reaching hk$70,088 million in 2011.
snow is the world s best-selling single beer brand and had sales volume of approximately 9,172,000 kiloliters in 2011.

leveraging our extensive retail network of around 4,000 stores in china, we strive to strengthen the market position of our retail division by committing to a strategy of national expansion that emphasizes strong regional leadership and synergistic opportunities with our multi-format business platform. in 2011, we continued to expand our footprint in various markets by establishing new supermarkets and specialty stores. we also improved our competitive edge by enriching our product mix, boosting sales of our mid to high-end products and improving our customers shopping experience.

despite the increasingly intense competition in china s beer industry, our beer division continued to be a leader in the china market as the result of the establishment of new breweries, our concerted efforts in brand building and successful acquisitions.
several investments were made during the year, including the equity stake acquisitions of hangzhou xihu beer asahi co., ltd.
(the remaining 55%) and zhejiang xihu beer asahi co., ltd. (the remaining 25%). by the end of 2011, we had a market share of over 20% in china s beer market and an annual sales volume of approximately 10,235,000 kiloliters, further strengthening our position as china s largest brewer in terms of volume.
remarkable achievements were also seen in various aspects, such as increased average selling price and operating profit, thanks to our strategies of widening product mix and boosting premium product sales.
during the year under review, our food division has further strengthened its np ng fung brand, which features premium food quality and safety, by stepping up its efforts in brand promotion and marketing. to maintain our competitive edge during the year under review, we continued to enhance our integrated quality supply chain, optimize our product mix and add value to our products. the group s assorted foodstuff operation also expanded its market share in china by making inroads into a number of provinces.
with our strategy of focusing resources on developing selected target markets to form the backbone of our future nationwide distribution network, our beverage division recorded sustained growth momentum in overall sales volume and established a stronger market position in 2011. in addition, we are confident that our joint venture with kirin holdings company, limited, bringing together the group s extensive distribution capabilities in china and kirin holdings company, limited s outstanding product development capabilities, will help make the division a powerful contender in china s non-alcoholic beverage market.

looking towards 2012, we expect the operating environment in china to remain challenging, with consumer sentiment still affected by volatility in the global economy, primarily the unfolding sovereign debt crisis in europe. nevertheless, backed by a rising disposable income per capita as a result of steady economic growth and the central government s initiatives to promote consumer spending in its 12th five-year plan , we believe that the consumer market in china will continue to demonstrate relatively stronger resilience to short term market fluctuations and remain optimistic about the development of the country s retail market in the long run.
the group has successfully built its market leadership in its core businesses through strategic expansion of market share and delivering steady business growth in the past 10 years. this track record has proven the strength of our strategy of national expansion that emphasizes strong regional leadership and synergistic opportunities with our core businesses. in the coming year, we will continue to reinforce our market leading position in china by taking advantage of our strong presence both nationally and in regional markets, as well as our extensive distribution network, reputable brands and diversified product portfolio. we will also seek out investment opportunities in a prudent manner so as to further expand our business, and maintain a tight grip on expenses as we enhance the economies of scale of our building on the strong consumer business platform that we have created over the years and our proven strategy of market expansion, we are well positioned to create increasing value for lastly, on behalf of the board, i would like to take this opportunity to thank our valued shareholders, customers and business associates for their trust and unwavering support. i would also like to thank our management and staff for their dedication and
