the year 2007 saw even stronger growth in china s overall economy, with the agricultural sector on a recovery track and the industrial sector showing steady growth. riding on this improving economic environment, our group s agribusinesses showed signs of improvement while our industrial business also reported substantial progress in 2007.
during the year under review, economic development in china did not show any signs of slowdown; national fixed asset investments continued to grow at a fast pace, with growth particularly noticeable in the western region of china where market demand for heavy-duty machinery equipment multiplied. moreover, strong domestic consumption resulting from an improved standard of living also spurred domestic demand further and benefited sales of the group s food products, motorcycles as china s economy takes off, agricultural and industrial reforms have also been implemented. in an effort to augment agricultural industrialization, new laws on farmers professional cooperatives ( fpcs ) were launched in july last year to empower the fpcs with legitimate rights and to provide systems for their establishment and operation, thereby, facilitating the development of the new socialist village and the agricultural industrialization.
with the fpcs in development, the group has been researching ways of complementing new players and attaining communal benefits. successful industrialization of china s agriculture will not come quickly; domestic agriculture will have to grow and reach a level of scale, standardization, specialization and commercialization, and to do so it will need not only time to mature, but also the support and coordination from government, financial institutions and enterprises. the inherent risk associated with funding the agricultural industry combined with government decisions to implement a tighter monetary control in order to combat domestic inflation could hinder the support of the fpcs by financial institutions, complicating further policy implementation.
in recent years, food and products from china have been repeatedly exposed to safety and quality issues and corrective measures of such will be overseen both at home and overseas. coupled with a rising yuan, china s exports will certainly be impacted. regarding the group s stance on product safety and quality, the group has always run its businesses with integrity, putting the safety and well- being of our customers above all else by adhering to strict safety and quality in all products, winning credibility from our customers. indeed, sales of our cooked food products in domestic and overseas markets both recorded growth last year, with sales particularly strong in the domestic market.
