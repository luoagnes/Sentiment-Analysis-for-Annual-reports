chairman s statement in the year of 2007, kingsoft corporation limited (the company , or kingsoft ) and its subsidiaries (hereinafter collectively referred to as the group ) have made signifi cant progress in strengthening kingsoft s position as a leading developer, distributor and service provider of online games and applications software in china, based on market share. we have also demonstrated that we are a leader in creativity, sustainability and investment value.
during this year, the management of the company has demonstrated their dedication and expertise in each of their respective positions. the board of directors have also been fully involved in the business by formulating strategies, setting up goals, implementing incentive stock option plans to attract talents, and restructuring the total revenue for the year ended december 31, 2007 increased by 76% to rmb556.6 million, compared with last year. the group s total audited profi t attributable to equity holders for the year ended december 31, 2007 was rmb164.7 million, an increase of 65% compared with last year. basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31, 2007 were rmb0.1815 and rmb0.1725 respectively.
we started kingsoft by developing and selling applications software, and since 1989 when we commercially launched our fi rst offi ce application software wps 1.0, the company had overcome various market challenges in the past 18 years. today applications software still generates a signifi cant part of our revenue. revenues from our applications software, with a focus on internet security products, increased by 59% to rmb156.5 million, for the year ended december 31, 2007 compared with last year. in 2006, kingsoft internet security received the china famous brand award from the bureau of general administration of quality supervision, inspection and quarantine and the best product of the year in china award by pc magazine.
in response to changes in the market and customers demand, we have leveraged our strong expertise in applications software to transform ourselves into a successful online game developer in recent years. we used to sell applications software to our customers at retail outlets but now, a larger amount of our revenue is generated from renewable subscriptions and recurring online purchases, which is a new form of service less vulnerable to privacy. for online games, we are moving from two dimensional ( 2d ) and two point 5 dimensional ( 2.5d ) to three dimensional ( 3d ) while the revenue model shifts from pay-to-play to free-to-play and item-billing. today, kingsoft is pioneering what we believe to be the future business platform on the internet, from product to service and from retail to online subscription. according to china internet network information center ( cnnic ), china s internet population grew by 53.3% or 73 million in 2007 to reach 210 million in december 2007. the number of broadband internet users increased at a higher rate of 57.1% to reach 163 million. internet penetration rate in china was only 16%, which is much lower than many other countries, and 3.1 percentage point lower than the global average standard of 19.1%, indicating strong potential for future growth (source: cnnic, 2008). industry data shows that our online subscribers are increasing at an impressive rate and that we have a higher percentage of revenue generated by online subscribers than many of our competitors.
