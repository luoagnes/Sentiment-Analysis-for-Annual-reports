primary aluminum market in 2005, the global aluminum market experienced a noticeable price fluctuation. the lowest price of three-month primary aluminum futures on london metals exchange ( lme ) was us$1,682 per tonne.
however, the price at the year end surged to us$2,289 per tonne, staying around a 17-years all time high, while the average price was us$1,900 per tonne, representing an increase of 10.3% compared to last year. in 2005, prc s aluminum market was relatively weak in the first three quarters with the price of three-month aluminum futures on shanghai futures exchange ( shfe ) ranging from rmb16,000 to rmb17,000. this was attributable to the abolishment of the tax refund of 8% along with the imposition of a 5% tariff on primary aluminum export by the chinese government. since october 2005, aluminum price on lme started to rise again upon market rumours of the decrease in aluminium output which led to the increase in domestic aluminum price. the highest price of three-month primary aluminum futures on shfe was rmb19,870 per tonne, recording a new ten-years high. the annual average price was rmb16,848 per tonne, representing a slight increase of 4.8% compared to last year.
the global output of primary aluminum for 2005 was 31.93 million tonnes, representing an increase of 7.0% compared to last year. prc s primary aluminum output continued a fast growth to 7,810,000 tonnes, representing an increase of 16.7% compared to last year. the global consumption of primary aluminum was 31.87 million tonnes, representing an increase of 5.9% compared to last year. the chinese economy recorded continuous growth has maintained the various extent of increase in consumption of primary aluminum maintained in different industries. the total domestic primary aluminum consumption was approximately 7,070,000 tonnes, representing an increase of 18.0% compared to last year.

in 2005, the global production of alumina was 61.24 million tonnes. however, global alumina consumption has continued to grow relatively fast and as only a few alumina projects have commenced production, the existing alumina production and the existing alumina production capacity continues to fall short of global demand.
the slight short-supply of alumina continued as the global refining capacity could not satify the global demand. the consumption volume of alumina reached approximately 62.38 million tonnes with a shortfall of approximately 1.14 million tonnes. in 2005, the gap in demand and supply of domestic- made alumina remained sharp. the annual domestic output of alumina products recorded continuous steady increase, amounting to approximately 8.51 million tonnes, representing an increase of 20.9% over the previous year, while the demand for alumina continued to grow to approximately 16.62 million tonnes, representing an increase of 18.7% over the previous year. in 2005, the prc imported approximately 7.02 million tonnes of alumina, representing an increase of 19.0% over the previous year. the prc market s reliance on imported alumina was approximately 50%.
