for client base and market expansion, in addition to further strengthening our sales channels in japan, korea and europe etc, we also dedicated efforts in securing new international markets, thereby enlarging our market share in the global market. in 2008, whilst increasing our supply ratio for our existing clients, we have extended our reach to notable brands such as nikon, sanyo, continental and lg. this clearly reflected that the quality of our products, advancement of our technologies and standard of our services were recognised by more international renowned customers.
our three major business segments, optical components, optoelectronic products and optical instruments, accounted for 45.8%, 43.9% and 10.3% of our revenue respectively. we have upgraded our existing products in the three segments. for optical components, we successfully developed 3.05.0 mega 3x zoom handset lens sets and 2.0 mega, 3.0 mega and 5.0 mega autofocus ( af ) handset lens sets. for optoelectronic products, we invented 2.0 mega and 3.0 mega autofocus ( af ) handset camera modules. for optical instruments, we completed the r&d in upgrading optical instruments such as the metallurgical microscope, jewelry microscope and uv spectrophotometer. our efforts in upgrading our products further strengthened the leading positions of our products in the industry.

while demand for our optical, optoelectronic components and optical instruments remained steady, we did see pressures from the unfavourable factors such as decline in average selling price, rise in labour cost, appreciation of rmb and increase in effective tax rates.
the group s revenues decreased by 8.3% during the financial year 2008 to approximately rmb1,267.1 million. profit attributable to equity holders of the company decreased by 65.2% to approximately rmb78.4 million, while basic earnings per share decreased by 68.0% to approximately rmb0.08. the board of directors (the board ) has proposed a final dividend of rmb0.020 per share.

the year of 2008 was a challenging year in the development history of sunny optical. we encountered some adversities under the microeconomic environment. fortunately, our operations were not materially affected and our financial position remained strong. we excelled our counterparts in terms of results performance. looking ahead, although there are new opportunities for the group in 2009, our product mix has been improved and many new products will be on the production stage shortly, but the group is cautious in estimating its 2009 results since the market demand is highly uncertain. in 2009, while consolidating our existing market share, we are dedicated in exploring international market and new applications.
directors will closely monitor the changes in relevant markets and procure the management to adopt corresponding strategies to implement the initiative of transformation from quantity expansion to quality improvements. meanwhile, we will further broaden our income sources and reduce expenditures by taking advantage of our experience in surviving the asian financial crisis in 1997, so as to ride out the challenging period in a stable manner and accumulate strengths for our development in the long run.

the many accomplishments we achieved in 2008 were the direct result of the combined efforts of our hard-working staff. therefore, i wish to sincerely thank my fellow directors and our group s employees for their dedication throughout the year, which has helped us overcome difficult market circumstances. also, i wish to extend my gratitude for the continued support of our shareholders, customers and suppliers.
we are committed to bringing solid financial returns to all our stakeholders by delivering future sustainable business growth.
