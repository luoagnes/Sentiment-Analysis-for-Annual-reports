chairman s statement on behalf of the board, i am pleased to present my report on the operations of the group for the financial year ended 31 december 2015.
profit attributable to shareholders the group s reported profit attributable to equity shareholders for the year ended 31 december 2015 amounted to hk$21,326 million, representing an increase of hk$4,574 million or 27% over hk$16,752 million for the previous year. reported earnings per share were hk$6.46 (2014: hk$5.11 as adjusted for the bonus issue in 2015).
excluding the fair value change (net of non-controlling interests and tax) of investment properties and investment properties under development, the group s underlying profit note attributable to equity shareholders for the year ended 31 december 2015 was hk$11,009 million, representing an increase of hk$1,191 million or 12% over hk$9,818 million for the previous year. underlying earnings per share were hk$3.33 (2014: hk$2.99 as adjusted for the bonus issue in 2015).
note: in order to fully exclude the effects of changes in fair value from the group s underlying profit, any cumulative fair value change of investment properties disposed of during the year (which has been included in calculating the net gain on disposal of investment properties and hence the profit attributable to equity shareholders of the company during the year) was added back in arriving at the underlying profit.
the comparative underlying profit and underlying earnings per share for the previous financial year have been restated to conform to the presentation basis for the year under review.
dr the honourable lee shau kee, gbm chairman and managing director net asset value attributable to shareholders as at 31 december 2015, the net asset value attributable to equity shareholders amounted to hk$251,247 million, translating into a net asset value per share of approximately hk$76.00.
in accordance with the group s current accounting policies, the non ip interests revaluation surplus (see note below) and the listed associates market value surplus (see note below) have not been, and will not be, reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the group. to provide shareholders with further understanding of the net asset value of the group, the following data are provided for for the group s land holding of about 11 million square feet in the new development areas of fanling north, hung shui kiu and ping che, the future development returns were not taken into account in dtz valuation. with such extensive land holding, their future contributions are promising.
note: non ip interests revaluation surplus: in accordance with the group s accounting policies on property interests of the group, only interests in investment properties and investment properties under development are stated at fair value at the end of the reporting period. all other property interests ( non ip interests ) are either stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses or at the lower of cost and net realisable value. in order to provide further information to shareholders, an independent firm of professional valuers, dtz was engaged to carry out an open market valuation of the non ip interests as at 31 december 2015.
if the non ip interests were to be stated at their open market valuation as at 31 december 2015, there would be an attributable unrealised surplus (net of tax) over the attributable book value of the non ip interests as at 31 december 2015 of approximately hk$50,592 million ( non ip interests revaluation surplus ).
listed associates market value surplus: another asset that carries a significant value in the consolidated financial statements of the group is its long-term investment in the listed associates, namely the hong kong and china gas company limited, hong kong ferry (holdings) company limited and miramar hotel and investment company, limited. if these listed associates were to be stated at their respective market values (being their closing market prices on the stock exchange of hong kong limited as at 31 december 2015), the attributable market value of the group s interests in these listed associates would give rise to an excess over their attributable book value in the consolidated financial statements of the group of approximately hk$29,095 million ( listed associates market if the above non ip interests revaluation surplus and the listed associates market value surplus, totalling approximately hk$79,687 million, were to be added to the net asset value attributable to equity shareholders as at 31 december 2015, the adjusted net asset value would become hk$330,934 million or approximately hk$100.10 per share.

supported by stable external economic conditions and strong housing demand, the property market in hong kong remained buoyant in the first half of 2015 notwithstanding a new round of mortgage-tightening measures launched by the hong kong monetary authority in early 2015. however, growing concerns over the us interest rate normalisation and an expected increase in the near-term supply of first-hand residential properties resulted in a wait-and-see attitude among homebuyers, which rendered a slowdown in the property market towards the year end.
during the year under review, the group s overall property sales performance was satisfactory. projects launched during the year included double cove grandview (phase 4 of double cove ) in ma on shan and an array of urban redevelopment boutique residences under the h collection (namely, jones hive in causeway bay, parker33 in shau kei wan, axis in hung hom, the zutten in ma tau kok, as well as high park grand and eltanin" square mile in mong kok). developments re-launched for sale such as 39 conduit road in mid-levels, double cove (phases 1-3) in ma on shan and the reach in yuen long were also well received. in addition, four deluxe apartments at 39 conduit road in mid-levels, which were previously held for leasing, were also disposed of during the year under review. together with the disposal of certain quality industrialcommercial space, the group sold hk$11,472 million worth of hong kong properties in attributable terms for the year ended 31 december 2015.
after the end of this financial year, the group continued to release various properties under development for sale, including the launching of harbour park in cheung sha wan and wellesley in mid-levels in january 2016 and double cove summit (phase 5 of double cove ) in march 2016.

in june 2015, a residential site in so kwun wat, tuen mun located in close proximity to harrow international school with stunning sea views, was acquired through public tender at a consideration of hk$3,628.9 million. it is planned to be developed into a high-end residential development, providing about 1,900 housing units. furthermore, the group s urban redevelopment projects with 80% to 100% of their ownerships acquired increased to 45 in number, representing about 3.8 million square feet in total attributable gross floor area.
the group has made use of multiple channels to expand its development land bank in hong kong. purely through acquisition of old tenement buildings for urban redevelopment (excluding conversion of new territories land, as well as public auction and tender), abundant land resources have been made available to the group for property development. together with the development projects which are sourced from land-use conversion of new territories land and public tenders, with the exception of a few projects earmarked for rental purposes, sizeable areas will be available to the group for property sales in the coming years (details are shown as follows).
(table 1) unsold units from the major development projects offered for sale there are 23 development projects available for sale: (table 2) projects pending sale in 2016 in the absence of unforeseen delays, the following 7 projects will be available for sale in 2016: (table 3) existing urban redevelopment projects the group has a total of 4 existing projects under planning for redevelopment or land-use conversion and the dates of their sales launch are not yet fixed. as outlined below, they are expected to provide about 1.1 million square feet in attributable gross floor area in the urban areas based on the buildings department s approved plans or the government s latest town planning: (table 4) newly-acquired urban redevelopment projects ownership fully consolidated there are 17 newly-acquired urban redevelopment projects with ownership fully consolidated. in the absence of unforeseen delays, most of these projects are expected to be available for sale or leasing in 2017-2018 and their expected attributable gross floor areas, based on the buildings department s approved plans or the government s latest town planning, are as follows: (table 5) newly-acquired urban redevelopment projects with over 80% ownership secured there are 28 newly-acquired urban redevelopment projects with over 80% ownership secured and their ownership will be consolidated by proceeding to the court for compulsory sale under the land (compulsory sale for redevelopment) ordinance . in the event that no court order is granted, the group may not be able to complete the consolidation of the ownership for development. if legal procedures go smoothly and in the absence of unforeseen delays, most of the projects set out below are expected to be available for sale in 2018-2020.
on the basis of the government s latest town planning, the expected gross floor areas are shown as follows: (table 6) newly-acquired urban redevelopment projects with over 20% but less than 80% ownership secured the group has other acquisitions in progress, involving 34 projects located in prime urban areas in hong kong and kowloon. currently, ownership of each project ranging from more than 20% to less than 80% has been achieved. the attributable land areas of these projects total about 230,000 square feet. if and when their ownerships are successfully consolidated, based on the government s latest town planning, the total estimated attributable gross floor area would be about 2.1 million square feet upon completion of redevelopment.
based on the respective ownership currently secured by the group for each project, the total pro-rata attributable gross floor area is about 900,000 square feet.
successful acquisitions of the above projects bear uncertainty. the group may not be able to consolidate ownerships of all projects.
redevelopments can only be implemented upon acquisition of the full ownership of the relevant projects.
among the aforesaid development projects, the following are the relatively sizeable ones, especially those with the prospect of assembling adjacent properties for combined development. supplementary information such as the estimated land cost and construction cost per square foot of gross floor area in relation to these projects are provided below: in june 2015, the group won the bid for a residential site in so kwun wat, tuen mun, with the particulars as follows: meanwhile, the group continues to replenish its land bank by acquiring old tenement buildings for redevelopment and applying for land-use conversion for its portfolio of new territories land. such dual approach to land banking has proven to be a reliable source of land supply with a lower acquisition cost, which is beneficial to the group s development returns in the long term.
during the year under review, the group finalised the land premium procedure for its commercial and residential development project at yuen long town lot no. 527 through the pilot scheme for arbitration on land premium, which was the first arbitration case successfully concluded under such pilot scheme in hong kong. this development project, having a site area of 6,131 square feet, will provide a total attributable commercial and residential floor area of approximately 16,954 square feet.
the urban redevelopment project of eltanin" square mile at mong kok, which was launched for sale recently, is a manifest example.
in terms of saleable area, the average selling price for the units sold for this project is about hk$17,000 per square foot, whereas the acquisition cost of the land site was about hk$4,300 per square foot (excluding construction cost and other expenses). as for double cove grandview (double cove phase 4) at ma on shan, which was sourced from land-use conversion, the average selling price for the units sold stands at about hk$15,000 per square foot, whereas its acquisition cost (including the cost for acquisition of new territories land and the land conversion premium) was only about hk$4,100 per square foot (excluding construction cost and other expenses). hence, it is evident that profit contributions from urban redevelopment projects, as well as new territories projects sourced from land-use conversion, are highly satisfactory.
the group currently has a land bank in hong kong comprising a total attributable gross floor area of approximately 24.4 million square feet, made up as follows: land in urban areas as aforesaid, there are currently 45 urban redevelopment projects of old tenement buildings with entire or over 80% ownership acquired, representing a total attributable gross floor area of about 3.8 million square feet, which are expected to be ready for sale or leasing in 2017 or beyond. the total land cost of such projects is estimated to be about hk$24,300 million (in spite of the inclusion of pricey street shops and the project at the prestigious seymour road in mid-levels), translating into a land cost of approximately hk$6,400 per square foot of gross floor area.
during the year under review, the group completed the acquisition of the entire interests in the projects at 69-83 fuk lo tsun road, kowloon city, 1-3 chung ching street, sheung wan and 31-33 whampoa street, hung hom. the sites for the project at 206-212 johnston road, wanchai, as well as two projects at 6-28 gillies avenue south76-78 baker street and 18-22a bulkeley street46-50 gillies avenue south in hung hom, were all enlarged following the completion of the acquisition of the for the industrial site at 18 king wah road, north point, it is planned to be redeveloped into an office building pending an appeal to the government on the amount of assessed land premium. meanwhile, the residential-cum-commercial project at yau tong bay is also in the process of application for land new territories land at the end of december 2015, the group held new territories land reserves amounting to approximately 45 million square feet in land area, which was the largest holding among all property developers in hong kong.

however, the group s retail portfolio, which comprises many large-scale shopping malls in the populous new towns catering to local consumption, recorded satisfactory rental income growth with nearly full occupancy (except those under renovation or realignment of tenant mix) at the end of december 2015. such satisfactory results were mainly due to the group s various initiatives to enhance the appeal of its malls so as to maintain their competitiveness. for instance, kolour has been established as a new brand comprising a series of cosy and chic shopping malls under the group s retail portfolio. during the year under review, citimall in yuen long and city landmark i and ii in tsuen wan were re-branded as kolour" yuen long and kolour" tsuen wan i and ii respectively. kolour" yuen long , after refining its tenant mix and upgrading its position, recorded considerable growth in rents and shopper traffic.

henderson investment limited ( hil ) hil s consolidated profit attributable to equity shareholders for the year ended 31 december 2015 amounted to hk$449 million, a significant turnaround from the loss of hk$7 million as recorded in the previous year. it is mainly due to a one-off gain of hk$355 million arising from the final arbitral award in relation to the toll fee collection right of hangzhou qianjiang third bridge during the year under review, as well as the full-year profit contribution of hk$103 million from citistore, which was acquired by hil on 1 december 2014.
commencing from 20 march 2012, payment of the toll fee in respect of hangzhou qianjiang third bridge to hangzhou henderson qianjiang third bridge company, limited ( joint venture company ) was provisionally suspended. an arbitration application (the arbitration ) was thus filed by the joint venture company on 17 september 2012 with china international economic and trade arbitration commission ( cietac ). on 30 april 2015, the arbitral tribunal of cietac issued the final arbitral award, which had legal binding effect on all parties to the arbitration. hangzhou municipal people s government shall pay to hil an amount of rmb376 million ( compensation payment ) within 90 days following the issue of the arbitral award. all tax payable in respect of the above payments ( prc tax ) in mainland china shall be borne and paid by hangzhou municipal people s government, which shall arrange for the prc tax clearance formality. as a result of the above arbitral award, hil recognised a profit in the amount of hk$215 million, which is equal to the compensation payment of rmb376 million as converted to hong kong dollars (net of hil s share of expenses relating to the arbitration) of hk$471 million and after (i) deducting hil s impairment loss on toll bridge operating right and related net assets of the joint venture company of hk$379 million (the joint venture company impairment ); (ii) recognising the reversal of the exchange reserve attributable to the joint venture company of hk$138 million; and (iii) deducting the operating loss of the infrastructure business in the aggregate amount of hk$15 million during the period from 1 january 2015 to 30 april 2015. adding back hil s non-controlling interests attributable share of joint venture company impairment and operating loss in the aggregate amount of hk$140 million, a one-off gain was recognised by hil attributable to equity shareholders which amounted to hk$355 million. as the entire compensation payment was duly settled by hangzhou municipal people s government on 29 july 2015, the collection agreement and joint venture contract were discharged and hil has no further obligations, responsibilities and payment obligations for expenses whether as a shareholder of the joint venture company or in relation to the joint venture company or hangzhou qianjiang third bridge, and is no longer entitled to any income sharing and distribution rights as a shareholder of the joint retailing has become the sole business of hil. due to a slowdown in inbound tourism, as well as weakened consumption sentiment arising from an uncertain economic outlook and exceptionally warm winter weather, retail sales in hong kong slackened distinctly in the fourth quarter of 2015, leading to a 3.7% drop in the value of total retail sales for the whole city during the year under review.
nevertheless, by serving the daily household needs of local consumers, hil s citistore operation recorded only a slight decrease in the total sales proceeds (which were derived from the sales of own goods, as well as the consignment and concessionaire sales) of 0.7% for the year ended 31 december 2015 with its breakdown as follows: citistore s sales of own goods retreated in the fourth quarter of 2015 due to the exceptionally warm weather in hong kong.
however, its total sales of own goods for the year under review amounted to hk$443 million, representing an increase of 3% over hk$431 million for the previous year. the household & toys category made up approximately 53% of the annual revenue from sales of goods, the apparel & accessories category contributed approximately 34% and the balance of approximately 13% came from the categories of cosmetics and food.
citistore regularly reviews its merchandise mix. having regard to market trends and consumer preferences, a wide range of highly sought-after products with better profit margins were introduced during the year under review. through keen promotional efforts and improved customer services, a stable gross margin of 36% was achieved along with increased sales.
citistore s concessionaire sales are conducted by licensing portions of shop spaces to its concessionaires for setting up their own concession counters to sell their products, whilst consignment sales comprise the sale of a consignor s own products on or in designated shelves, areas or spaces. these consignment and concessionaire counters are charged on the basis of revenue sharing or basic rent (if any), whichever is higher, which are recognised as citistore s rental income. during the year under review, the total rental income derived from these consignment and concessionaire counters was flat at hk$429 million compared with the previous year, despite the slight year-on-year drop in the total sales proceeds from these counters.
in summary, due to (i) the decrease in profit contribution in the fourth quarter of 2015 as a result of the exceptionally warm weather in hong kong; (ii) rental charges in the accounts being higher than the actual rental expenses in the early part of the tenure as a result of amortised rental expenses during the year based on the new 9-year tenancy lease agreements, which became effective in october 2014, with rent escalation for each 3-year period, and (iii) a one-off net gain of hk$17 million in the previous year from the reversal of rent-free amortisation upon early termination of the preceding lease agreements, citistore s profit after taxation for the year ended 31 december 2015 amounted to hk$103 million, representing a decrease of 27% or hk$39 million as compared with the previous year.
