the link reit has achieved another year of strong operating results for unitholders.

total distributable income rose by 13.5% to hk$1,819 million. the board has recommended a final distribution per unit of hk43.13 cents which, together with the interim distribution per unit of hk40.86 cents, gives a total distribution per unit of hk83.99 cents for the year, representing an increase of 12.9% over last year.

during the year under review, the link reit continued to implement business strategies designed to realise the potential of the portfolio and to rejuvenate a number of shopping centres. we recognise that our success rests with working together with both our tenants and shoppers. accordingly, we have continued with our investment programmes across a range of asset enhancement projects. the improvements in physical structure, trade and tenant mixes, and customer service, are enhancing the shopping environment thus boosting footfall, providing a more enjoyable shopping experience to shoppers and generating strong returns to continuous sales and marketing programmes during the year have also brought about increased shoppers patronage in our centres and increased business opportunities to tenants, through consistent retail sales.
all these efforts are reflected in this year s results which support stated business strategies and initiatives. the defensive nature of the trade mix and business has made us more resilient to the economic downturn. we continue to be committed to these strategies which we believe will not only benefit tenants and shoppers, but also the communities we serve.

apart from providing returns to unitholders, the link reit continues to support a range of charitable causes, cultural and artistic activities and environmental initiatives to enhance a harmonious community relationship. our efforts have been recognised through a number of business and charitable awards. we take our social and corporate responsibilities seriously and will continue to work with all our stakeholders for the benefit of the communities we serve.
