business and prospects the group s turnover dropped slightly as compared to the last year. it is the mixed result of the complete close down of the food manufacture operation in the people s republic of china (the prc ) and the increase of rental income for the year.
following the economic recovery in hong kong and the continued strong economic growth in the prc, both the occupancy rate and rental improved moderately as compared with last year.
the annual rental for the year has slightly increased by 8% to approximate hk$3,884,000.
as it is widely expected the economic growth of the prc will continue to outperform other market, the management has proposed to further explore business opportunity in the prc that provides strong and stable asset base and reasonable return. currently, the company is negotiating with he fu international limited, the controlling shareholder of the company to acquire its assets and inject into the company. however, no agreement has been reached.
the company believes that if the agreement is reached between both parties, the assets to be injected will largely widen the asset base of the company and also provide long-term stable revenue to the company.
