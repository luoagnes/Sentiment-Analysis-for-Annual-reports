we will stay alert and be confident about overcoming difficulties as we strive for a greater market share and scale new heights in a centralized management system, economies of scale, diversification and internationalization with the solid ground of our vinda international holdings limited
chairman s statement on behalf of the board of directors (the board ) of vinda international holdings limited ( vinda international or the company , which together with its subsidiaries is referred to as the group ), i am pleased to present the group s annual report for the year ended 31 december 2014.
2014 was a challenging year as china s economy, retail consumer market and household paper industry have all shifted down from rapid to steady growth. the group s profitability has been put to the test as it is navigating the country s household paper market with the tailwind of growing and inelastic demand and against the headwind of periodic overcapacity in the industry. the market conditions, which have prompted the industry to step up its efforts to promote sales, were complicated by rapidly rising labor costs and the weakening renminbi.
during the year, the group stood up to the challenges, with its revenue increasing by 17.5% to hk$7,985.2 million (2013: hk$6,798.0 million) and gross profit rising by 22.2% to hk$2,408.7 million (2013: hk$1,971.7 million). profit attributable to equity holders increased by 9.3% to hk$593.5 million (2013: hk$542.9 million), and basic earnings per share were 59.4 hk cents (2013: 54.3 hk cents). as a token of gratitude for shareholders long-term support, the board proposed payment of a final dividend of 12.0 hk cents per share for the financial year ended 31 december 2014.
