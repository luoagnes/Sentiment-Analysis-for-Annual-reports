there is a large number of pharmaceutical companies in china, resulting in fragmented market share. many of the companies have the problems of limited resource, shortage of capital and no competitive advantage. as the government authorities are more rigorous on regulating the industry, there is a clear trend of consolidation among the pharmaceutical companies. while carrying on with organic growth, the group is seeking for m&a targets to enhance its market power and reputation. the group will focus on tcm, looking for m&a opportunity in all areas in the sector.
the group will face both opportunities and challenges in the year of 2014. it is the first year for the group to produce fully consolidated financial statements after acquiring tongjitang. following the completion of the consolidation, synergy from all aspects of the business will be revealed gradually. on the other hand, the ongoing change of government policy and the intense competition during the process of industry consolidation impose challenges toward the organic growth and m&a strategy of the group.
with a solid business foundation, numerous market opportunities, efficient and flexible financing channels, and strong support from its shareholders, the group will be the leader of tcm industry, achieving ongoing growth of revenues and profits and creating value for all shareholders.
