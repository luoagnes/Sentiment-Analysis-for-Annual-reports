chairman s statement on behalf of the board, i present the fifteenth annual report of shangri-la the year ended on a satisfactory note for the group in terms of its financial performance. the group s hotels and investment properties have experienced year-on-year increases in yields for three years in a row since 2004. supported by this trend, the consolidated profit attributable to equity holders for the year ended 31 december 2007 was us$340.9 million (earnings per share us12.76 cents) compared to us$202.2 million (earnings per share us7.97 cents) for the year 2006. profits were also enhanced by net credit from non-operating items in 2007 of us$142.6 million compared to us$52.2 million in 2006.
the board recommends a dividend of hk12 cents per share. with the interim dividend of hk15 cents per share paid in 2007, the total dividend for 2007 is hk27 cents per share.
the group has an aggressive programme for the development and operation of new hotels both owned and managed for third parties. as at 31 december 2007, the group s portfolio comprised 57 hotels (27,175 rooms) owned and or managed by the group. its development plans will see this number exceed 100 hotels (43,000 rooms) by 2012, requiring the deployment of considerable financial and managerial resources to this task. in this connection, the group successfully completed a rights issue on 12 september 2007 through which it raised net proceeds of us$663 million. it had available lines of credit from banks of us$1,363.4 million on 31 december 2007 which, when supplemented by operating fund flows from its growing portfolio of owned hotels, should be adequate to fund its obligations on its development programmes. the group is aggressively increasing the range and depth of its training programmes to nurture and promote talents from within to service its growth plans. the group is firmly committed to maintaining its dominance in the luxury hotel segment in asia and is establishing a presence in key high profile, gateway locations around the world which are of strategic business interest.
while most asian economies have experienced unprecedented rates of gdp growth these past few years and the strengthening of their local currencies relative to the us dollar, the crisis that has manifested itself these past few months in the financial markets in north america and to some extent europe, is creating increasing uncertainty about its effects on the health of the global and regional economies. thus far the group s hotels have not experienced any slow down in their businesses from these important source markets. further, the staging of the olympics in beijing in august 2008 will clearly positively impact the performance of the group s hotels in mainland china as travel volumes (both overseas arrivals and domestic travelers) continue to surge in the run-up to this major event. in general, the group remains cautiously optimistic about its financial performance for 2008.
on behalf of the board, i would like to thank the management and staff of the group for their dedication and hard work.
