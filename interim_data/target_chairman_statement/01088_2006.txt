1. international market the international monetary fund has forecasted that global economic growth in 2006 will be 4.3%, of which that of japan, korea and china taiwan will be 2%, 5% and 5% respectively, which is equal to or slightly higher than that of 2005. it is expected that demand for coal will continue to increase gradually. in 2006, coal supply in the asia-pacific region is also expected to present a gradual upward trend. increase of coal production in australia is expected to be 4 to 5 million tonnes and that in indonesia will be about 10 million tonnes, while the export volume of china is expected to remain stable.
2. domestic market according to the 2005 statistics on national economy and social development issued by the state statistical board and the preliminary forecast of the ndrc, the prc gdp in 2005 was rmb18,232.1 billion, representing an increase of 9.9% on a year-on- year basis; industry added value was rmb7,619 billion, representing an increase of 11.4%; raw coal production volume was 2.19 billion tonnes, coal consumption was 2.14 billion tonnes and gross power generation was 2,470 billion kwh, representing year-on-year increase of 9.9%, 10.6% and 12.3% (1) coal market according to the preliminary forecast of the ndrc, domestic demand for coal in 2006 will be about 2.17 billion tonnes, of which coal for power generation will account for 1.21 billion tonnes. in addition to an export volume of about 80 million tonnes, the aggregate demand will be approximately 2.25 billion tonnes. in respect of coal production capacity, according to statistics provided by the ndrc, the aggregate capacity of all coal mines licensed to produce coal was 2.26 billion tonnes as at april 2005. on 27 december 2005, the ndrc issued a notice on the coordination of the production and transportation among key coal mines in 2006, which stated that, subject to a generally stable condition of thermal coal prices, the prc government will terminate its measures taken to interfere with thermal coal prices adopted at the end of 2004. transaction prices will now be decided by contracting parties and new measures will be implemented accordingly. the prc government has been increasingly concerned about the production safety of coal mines, as well as protection for and reasonable mining of coal resources, and therefore tightening the requirements in respect of coal mine operations.
as a result, more than 5,000 small coal mines without basic conditions for safe production have been closed down. this will in turn affect coal production volumes to a certain extent. the ministry of land and resources has promulgated that small coal mines located within the base of large-scale mines will be reduced by 70% by 2010 and will generally cease to operate by 2015. in respect of coal transportation capacity, daqin rail line has gained 50 million tonnes of transportation capacity through infrastructure upgrades, while houyue rail line has gained about 5 million tonnes of transportation capacity in 2 0 0 6 . h o w e v e r, t h e transportation capacities of major rail lines such as shitai, taijiao and longhai have reached their full transportation capacity, which will be difficult to increase. the capacity expansion project of qinhuangdao port coal phase iv was completed, and coal phase v will be completed in the first quarter of 2006, thus adding 65 million tonnes of throughput capacity in total. in conclusion, the total demand and supply of coal in the prc in 2006 is generally expected to be the same, and the market coal price is basically expected to remain stable without significant changes.
(2) power market in 2005, the installed capacity in the prc reached 508,410 mw, representing a year-on-year increase of 14.9%, of which 384,130 mw were coal-fired power, accounting for approximately 75.6% of the total capacity, or a year-on-year increase of 16.6%. gross power generation in the prc reached 2,470 billion kwh, representing a year-on-year increase of 12.3%, of which coal-fired power generated was 2,018.0 billion kwh, representing approximately 81.5% of the aggregate power generated. the utilisation hours of power generation units were 5,411 hours, of which that of coal-fired power units were 5,876 hours. the coal consumption rate for nationwide power supply was 374gkwh. the total power usage was 2,468.9 billion kwh, representing a year-on-year increase of 13.5%, of which daily urban power usage was 283.8 billion kwh, representing a year- on-year increase of 16.2%.
on 15 december 2004, the ndrc issued a policy to index thermal coal price to power tariff, allowing power generation companies to pass through 70% of increase in thermal coal prices to end users through increases in on-grid tariffs. in may 2005, the prc government implemented this policy for the first time.
the state grid corporation estimates that in 2006, the installed capacity of power generation units in the prc will increase to about 81,170 mw and the total installed capacity will reach 590,000 mw. power consumption in the prc is expected to reach 2,750 billion kwh, representing a year-on-year increase of about 11.8%. the largest power supply shortage in the prc will amount to 10,000 mw, located mainly in guangdong, zhejiang and hebei (v) future outlook in future, coal demand for power generation is expected to continue to increase steadily as a result of sustained global economic growth. in addition, the demand for power in the prc is expected to increase, thereby accelerating the growth in coal demand for power generation.
these favourable factors could provide a positive business environment for the company.
with our continued efforts in expanding and upgrading our coal and power generation businesses, the company will be well-positioned to capture opportunities arising from the increasing demand for energy in the company has determined, after prudent study of its business environment and market trends, its strategies for development for the next five years as follows: committing to industry modernisation, using coal as the foundation of our coal and power businesses with the support of scientific management techniques and continuous innovation, we are seeking, through motivation, innovation and expansion, an annual increase in coal production and sales of more than 15 million tonnes, and our annual coal production capacity to reach 200 million tonnes by 2010 so as to become a key player in the global energy industry with a competitive edge in the international market by building intrinsically safe operations, maintaining the quality of its products, remaining maintaining a high resource recovery rate and developing sustainably. to this end, the company will implement the following in 2006: " to strengthen and enlarge our businesses with the aim of becoming an enterprise with a global competitive edge to join the ranks of the top " to practise the concept of and emphasise on quality " when appropriate, to acquire the quality assets of the coal and power businesses of shenhua group corporation limited " to seize every opportunity and participate actively in the integration of coal industry in china by mergers and acquisitions in a prudent manner so as to increase our market share and coal reserves; " to actively source foreign coal resources to improve our global market share; " to improve the corporate governance structure of the group, capitalise on t he f u nc t io ns of independent directors, and strengthen our internal control systems so as to reduce operational risks; " to increase innovation in our key operating areas.
