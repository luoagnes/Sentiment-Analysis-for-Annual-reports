iam pleased to report the results of hopewell highway infrastructure limited and its subsidiaries for the financial year ended 30 june 2011.
the group s net toll revenue rose by 17% to hk$2,275 million compared to the previous year, while the net profit from toll road projects decreased by 5%, from hk$1,017 million to hk$967 million. this was mainly attributable to a significant rise in the amount of tax payable as the result of a step-up in the enterprise income tax rate applicable to gs superhighway, plus a loss incurred by phase ii west during its first full-year of operation. profit attributable to owners of the company increased by 6%, from hk$956 million to hk$1,018 million, owing partly to a net exchange gain resulting from the appreciation of the renminbi and an increase in interest income. basic earnings per share for the year increased by about 7% from the previous year s hk32.28 cents to hk34.39 cents.

the group maintained a strong financial position throughout the year. its proportionate share of the net toll revenue for the year ended 30 june 2011 increased by 17% year-on-year, from hk$1,940 million to hk$2,275 million.
in accordance with the group s financing strategy and against the backdrop of credit-tightening in the prc, a total of rmb1.98 billion was raised by issuing rmb bonds twice during the year; the first tranche of rmb1.38 billion in july 2010 and the second tranche of rmb600 million in may 2011. the proceeds from these will be applied mainly to finance the development of phase iii west in the form of equity investment and shareholder s loans. up to 30 june 2011, the group had injected a total of rmb496 million into the west financial year 2010 2011 % change gs superhighway (at jv company level) average daily traffic (no. of vehicles 000) 352 392 11% average daily toll revenue (rmb 000) 9,576 10,114 6% phase i west (at jv company level) average daily traffic (no. of vehicles 000) 31 37 18% average daily toll revenue (rmb 000) 436 463 6% phase ii west (at jv company level) average daily traffic (no. of vehicles 000) 20* 44 122% average daily toll revenue (rmb 000) 333* 756 127% * phase ii west opened on 25 june 2010 route jv as registered capital for the development of phase iii west. it had also advanced shareholder s loans in the total amount of rmb500 million to the west route jv for the same purpose. these shareholder s loans helped to broaden the jv s financing sources. it is planned that further shareholder s loans amounting to rmb600 million will be advanced to the west route jv for the same purpose, subject to approval by the the group s cash and bank balances, which were nearly all in rmb, amounted to hk$3,439 million as at 30 june 2011, including the yet-to-be-utilised proceeds from rmb bond issues. net cash on hand at hhi corporate level (excluding jv companies) was hk$1,030 million.
the group will continue to keep most of its cash in rmb in the future, in line with its policy to adopt rmb as its functional currency. interest income for the year increased significantly, owing to the leap in the average cash balance and an increase in bank deposit interest rates. the group will continue to reinforce its treasury management and evaluate the available options with the aim of improving the yields on its ample cash deposit portfolio in the future.
the group s project debts are well covered by project cash flows. expressed in terms of project interest coverage the ratio of the group s proportionately shared project ebitda for fy11 to the corresponding project s interest expenses it is approximately 10.9 times.
the group s cash inflow for the year was mainly derived from dividends declared by the gs superhighway jv and proceeds from rmb bond issues. following approval by the relevant prc authorities, the group has been able to remit its share of the profits from the gs superhighway jv and west route jv to hong kong directly in rmb since april 2010, without having to convert them into hk or us dollars first.

during the year under review, the global economy remained fragile with the pace of economic recovery being uneven in different regions, and stagnant in some. despite various quantitative easing measures, the united states economy has not yet started to rebound. the contagious sovereign debt crisis among member countries of the european union has put intense pressure on the interest rate spreads of sovereign debt. although substantial steps have been taken to address this crisis, the successful implementation of long-term plans to reform tax and fiscal policies in the region still has a long way to go. in asia, efforts to curb inflation which is being driven by the strength of emerging economies and abundant global liquidity have hampered growth to a certain extent.
the prc s economic and financial strength, its increasing share of global gdp and its rising credit quality and currency have combined to create a strong case for long-term investment in its assets.
increasing investment in fixed assets and burgeoning domestic consumption continue to drive china s property and financial markets. despite various measures to curb soaring inflation and tighten credit, the gdp of guangdong province in the first half of 2011 increased by 10.2% while the import and export trades maintained a strong growth of 26.0%, boosting the prd region s transportation industry and benefiting the group s toll road business.
reflecting the growth in car ownership, the number of class 1 small cars using our toll roads in the prd and the toll revenue derived from them continued to increase. on the other hand, the number of class 4 and 5 commercial trucks and the toll revenue from those vehicles continued to recover as the prd region s import and export traffic rebounded.
as a consequence of the aforementioned growth in traffic of the gs superhighway and the opening of phase ii west in june 2010, the aggregate average daily traffic rose by 23% to 473,000 vehicles year-on-year.
meanwhile, the aggregate average daily toll revenue climbed by 13% to rmb11.3 million and the average daily toll revenue of the gs superhighway exceeded rmb10 million on a yearly basis. the average daily toll revenue of phase ii west jumped by over 70% from july 2010 (its first full-month of operation) to june 2011.
the combined revenue for the year from phase i west and phase ii west accounted for about 11% of the total revenue from the group s toll roads.
construction work on phase iii west is making good progress, and it is now planned for completion during the first half of 2013, earlier than originally scheduled.
the total investment in this project is currently planned to be approximately rmb5.6 billion. hhi s 50% share of the registered capital of this investment and a certain amount of shareholder s loans therefor have been and will continue to be funded by proceeds raised through its rmb bond issues.

traffic on phase ii west has grown steadily since it opened in june 2010. its average daily traffic volume rose by 89%, up from 29,000 vehicles in july 2010 to 55,000 vehicles in july 2011. meanwhile, its average daily toll revenue surged by 85%, from rmb500,000 in july 2010 to rmb925,000 in july 2011. the synergy between phase i west and phase ii west and the development of the highway network is expected to continue to generate growth in the traffic volume and toll revenue of both.
in respect of the maintenance works being done at the yajisha bridge of the guangzhou east-south-west ring road since january 2010, intensified measures have been put in place since mid-july 2011 to prohibit heavy trucks weighing over 15 tons from entering and exiting the east-south section of the guangzhou east- south-west ring road via the nanya interchange of phase i west. as the maintenance works are expected to be completed by january 2012, the impact from such arrangement on phase i west is short-term. its impact on the group s total traffic and toll revenue should be following the completion of widening work on the 3.5-kilometre section between the wudianmei and taiping interchanges of the gs superhighway in june 2011, the jv company will further expand the approximately 2-kilometre busy section between the hezhou and fuyong interchanges to 10 lanes in dual directions in the coming months. the group believes the gs superhighway will maintain its leading position as guangdong province s main artery, despite anticipated competition from the coastal expressway from 2012 onwards.
the broader financing sources now available for phase iii west have secured the project s progress. its completion in first half of 2013 earlier than scheduled and the target completion of the hong kong-zhuhai-macau bridge in 2016 will further enhance the prd region s highway network. the opening of all three phases of the western delta route will serve as a platform for the long-term growth of the group s toll road business.

i would like to take this opportunity to thank the group s managing director, my fellow directors, the management team and all staff members for their hard work, dedication and commitment during the past year. i would also like to thank all our shareholders, financiers and business partners for their continuous support and confidence in the group, which contributed greatly towards the group s success during the past year.
