statement from the chairman after a long period of economic growth in hong kong, we are now operating in an environment made difficult by the global financial turmoil and the prospect of a prolonged international recession.
since the last quarter of 2008 we have witnessed a marked slowdown in market activities, which exert considerable pressure on our businesses. without any signs of the economy reversing the present downward trend, operators in hong kongs highly competitive telecommunications market are expected to be under continuous challenges in the year ahead.
fortunately, we enter this period of uncertainty with a degree of financial and operational strength, as well as a distinctly strong brand, thanks to the efforts of a skilled and talented team that has produced a succession of innovative services for our customers in both the private and public sectors in hong kong and overseas.
furthermore, i am pleased to report that we completed a corporate restructuring last year. the groups operational efficiencies will improve as a result of this restructuring, which has grouped our telecoms services, media and it solutions businesses under a new company, hkt group holdings limited.
pccw is hong kongs premier telecommunications provider. going forward, we will continue to work hard to consolidate our leadership position in the industry via enhanced innovation and service quality, and with optimization of operating and capital expenditures. to achieve these goals, all staff must work together with determination to continue to provide our customers with pccws high quality products and services.
these are challenging times, and we look forward to the unwavering support of our shareholders and customers.
