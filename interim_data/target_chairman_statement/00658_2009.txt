in view of the sustained and fast business growth of the group and its full confidence towards the future, the company issued convertible bonds in may 2008 and entered into an equity swap contract with a term of three years with the lead manager to hedge the risks brought by the share price increasing to a level above the initial price. the issue was beneficial to the business growth of the group under the then prevailing market condition. however, the financial tsunami together with the fact that some companies suffered losses from their investments involving derivatives aroused market concerns over the activities of enterprises in this regard. to remove investors worries and for the best interests of the group and the shareholders, the group decided to further purchase bonds through over-the-counter transactions at a time when the market valuation of bonds was attractive. currently, the company has purchased approximately 42.5% of the bonds. during the period under review, by virtue of its strong strengths and sound financial condition, the group successfully turned crisis into opportunities and recorded a revenue of approximately rmb107,941,000 from the repurchase of convertible bonds, which helped to redeem the market in addition to the confidence vote cast by investors, the company also received support form state leaders with a number of state leaders paying visits to the plants of the group, details of which are: " on 10 january 2009, premier wen jiabao paid a visit to the plants of the company during his inspection tour to jiangsu " on 2 february 2009, vice premier wang qishan paid a visit to the plants of the company with a group of officers.
