the qingyuan industrial estate is planned to produce more digital consumer electronic products. however, with the initial launch of new digital products, the production facilities in qingyuan are yet to operate at optimum levels. during the year, sales of these new products did not provide significant contribution to the group s turnover.
during the year, the group has also determined to enhance its automation in the production process. the group acquired additional sets of plastic injection and surface mounted machines, stamp presses and dies and cnc machinery for moulding operation. the group also installed swing robots and autospraying equipment with c10,000 cleaning room standards. all these measures will contribute to our overall production efficiency and quality. on top of its existing four power generators in dongguan ngai lik electronics industrial city, the group acquired an additional 4,000 kw power generator to further reduce its power costs. as a result, the group s capital expenditure for fy2005 reached a peak level of hk$328 million (2004: hk$218 as the capex was on the nature of fixed assets, it will benefit the group in the long run. it is considered that the qingyuan industrial estate will provide competitive advantages for the group in the development of digital product business. in particular, the group is equipped with new production facilities, together with a high extent of during the year, america remained its largest market followed by europe. hk$2,361 million and hk$621 million of the group s products were sold to america and europe, accounting for 69.1% and 18.2% of the group s total turnover respectively. in prior year, approximately hk$2,038 million and hk$813 million of the group s products were sold to america and europe respectively. the group maintained good relationship with the major reputable retailers, in particular the group committed to fulfill the customers orders despite of the rising raw materials prices during the year. the group also successfully acquired certain reputable distributors during the year which further helped expanding the distribution of its products to america.

every company from time to time encounters different kinds of challenges. when we do, we face them and endeavour to deal with them. challenges and difficulties will continue to arise in the coming financial year 2006 ( fy 2006 ). the current business condition becomes even more difficult. the general trend in interest rate is uprising and it is generally anticipated that rmb will appreciate in near future. moreover, the prices of oils and plastic have climbed to new heights which may slow down global economic growth. together with shortage in labour and electricity supplies, the business environment in china is getting less favorable to the manufacturers.
thanks to the well-developed production platforms and strong financial standing of ngai lik, ngai lik still continue to implement its business strategy, which is low-cost production of a wide variety of quality consumer electronic products targeting at the mass market.

maintaining good relations with customers will also ensure sizeable orders to maximize the usage of the qingyuan industrial estate.
with the global trend of digitalization of consumer electronic products, the group expects the sales of traditional audio products to decline in the future. top line will be affected moderately and a drop of about 10% to 15% in sales of traditional audio products is anticipated for the coming year. in anticipation of this market trend, the group will actively promote its new higher value digital products including a series of mp3 and portable dvd players to customers. the initial response from customers for these new products is positive. the group aims to change the product mix and increase the sales of such digital products to not less than 10% of sales revenue in the immediate future. as such, the group expects the fy2006 will be a year for product transition.
looking ahead, the group will try its utmost best to improve the position with its long-term mission to become a leading player in consumer electronic products market. the group will expedite the pace of product launch to enhance its gross margin with an aim to improve profitability.
