during the year under review, the trust performed strongly, delivering its expected growth during 2016, and achieving a record high 
in 2016, unexpected events such as the uks brexit vote in europe and the us presidential election outcome have raised uncertainties in the global economy, causing volatilities in currency, stock markets and interest rates. against this background, the trust's distributable income increased distribution per unit("dpu") achieved a solid growth of 15.7% to hk$0.2295 (2015: hk$0.1983), which was driven by rental income increase from three garden road and cost savings due to its improved 
total rental income for 2016 was 
11.5% compared with hk$2,063 million for 2015. the solid growth was mainly due to higher average occupancy of three garden road. as major leases committed previously started to have a full year impact, occupancy of the property was maintained at above 90% during 2016. rental income of the property went up by 19.7%. on the other hand, innovative marketing campaigns enabled the langham place mall to show resilience against the retailing downturn and recorded stable growth.
the higher average occupancy in three garden road helped reduce the trusts overall operating costs and the net property operating expenses ratio thereby improved to 11.8% in 2016, compared with 13.5% in 2015. the higher rental income and lower net property operating expenses resulted in an increase of 13.6% in net property income.
net property income for 2016 was 
hk$1,784 million for 2015.
while the refinancing undertaken in june 2016 has reduced interest margin and removed all refinancing risks over the next few years, the rising interest rate environment will put pressure on funding costs. to mitigate the impact of interest rate rises, a more proactive approach has been taken to increase the fixed rate portion of total debt.
the trust has also tapped the bond market to lock in long-term funding costs via private placement under the medium term note program. in addition, the trust has also commenced a hedging program to swap part of the floating-rate loan into fixed-rate. as at 27 february 2017, the trust has effectively fixed the interest rate of hk$500 million of our bank loans by entering into interest rate swap contracts at an average interest rate at 1.735%. our fixed rate portion accounts for 25% of total debt outstanding for the time being, we are watching the market closely for opportunity to fix more.
the appraised value of the trusts properties was hk$66.8 billion as at 31 december 2016, an increase of 3.2% compared with hk$64.8 billion as at 31 december 2015, driven primarily by higher rental rate assumptions. net asset value per unit was hk$8.72 as at 31 december 2016, an increase of 3.8% compared with hk$8.40 as at 31 december 2015. the gearing ratio decreased marginally to 21.7% as at 31 december 2016 from 22.1% as at 31 december 2015.
the world in 2017 would be an uncertain place. globally, the uncertainty surrounding the new us administration has the potential to create trade disputes and problems to the worldwide economy, and several elections in europe later this year may potentially add surprises to the market. closer to home the uncertain china economic outlook and the control on capital flow will require us to be vigilant and prudent. strong us dollar might dampen the recovery in tourist numbers and spending in hong kong. all these macro factors together with higher interest rates in the interest rate hike cycle could 
looking ahead, the market is facing a lot of uncertainties.
an uncertain market presents challenges. however, it also leads to opportunities and the trust will be looking closely for these. we will confidently apply all our knowledge, expertise and innovation to meet the challenges of the operating environment and we will seek out any opportunities arising in the current market that will assist us to optimize unitholders value in the long term. most importantly, prudence must be observed.
