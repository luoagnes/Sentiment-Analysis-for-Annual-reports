sands cotai central, our latest development on cotai and the largest integrated resort development in the companys history, opened its fi rst phase on april 11, 2012. sands cotai central adds approximately 5,800 hotel rooms, expansive retail shopping, food and beverage, meeting and convention, entertainment and gaming capacity to cotai and further solidifi es our presence as the leading integrated resort developer and operator in the market. on december 20, 2012, we opened a fully enclosed climate-controlled footbridge with escalators and moving walkway to enhance the inter-connectivity and accessibility between our cotai strip properties.
our properties continue to generate market-leading visitation and in 2012 we welcomed over 46 million visitors to our cotai strip properties, including over 5 million in the month of december alone. we are incredibly proud to be contributing to the increasing visitation to macao from across the region. importantly, the benefi ts of our integrated resort business model extend far beyond our own fi nancial success. the companys properties and service offerings enhance macaos appeal as a business and leisure tourism destination, helping to diversify macaos economy and to provide meaningful employment opportunities for the people of macao. looking ahead, i am confi dent that the introduction of the parisian macao, our next development on cotai, which we are targeting to open by late 2015, will meaningfully contribute to macaos position as a leading business and leisure destination in asia.
importantly, we could not have achieved our record fi nancial results without the hard work and dedication of sands chinas more than 25,000 team members and i look forward to their continued contributions in the years ahead.
our sands china business strategy remains straightforward: complete the successful execution of our cotai strip development strategy and maximize return for shareholders by leveraging our integrated resort business model and world-class amenities to generate market-leading revenue and cash fl ow. we look forward to sharing the companys continued success with you and other stakeholders at the upcoming sands china annual general meeting.
