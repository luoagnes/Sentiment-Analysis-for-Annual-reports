the business focus of our wealth management services gradually recognised by the market, the differentiated competitive advantages starting to emerge. the core service brands such as oto fortune , win to fortune and bocom fortune have been widely recognised by the rising number of middle-and-high-end customers. the group was rewarded several major awards including the best supply chain finance bank , the best china private wealth management bank , the best china cash management bank and so on. the concept of one bocom, one customer was integrated into the whole process of product development and services, effectively meeting diversifi ed, personalised, innovative wealth management demands of customers.
a determined goal is the starting point of all achievements. since the implementation of the bocom strategy , the group s cross-border, cross-industry, and integrated operation capabilities have been signifi cantly improved and its business collaboration and synergy development have become a signifi cant competitive advantage. we believe, the bocom strategy will continue to lead the pace of the bank s supporting the real economy the banking industry would achieve the real growth stability only if it serves the real economy, participates in the development of national economy, and connects with customers in various industries. during the year of 2012, the bank conscientiously implemented the state s macroeconomic control policy, actively responded to the transformation of the economic development pattern and the industrial restructuring and upgrading. through the proper adjustment to the lending structure and loan extension pace, and the optimisation of the allocation mechanism of its existing and incremental credit resources, the bank is able to provide more solid and effi cient fi nancial services to the real economy.

id-depth execution of the second round of reform looking head, the reform of the bank will be confronted with three urgent tasks. first, the bank will need to maintain a steady growth pace and uphold its existing industrial position in an ever changing operating environment. second, the bank will need to accelerate its pace of transformation to meet the demands of future market competition as its traditional operation model faces great challenges. third, the bank will need to strengthen its capacity of innovative services to enhance its unique development in an environment of intensive industry competition.
there is an old saying in china that change leads to solution rather than obstruction; change leads to prosperity rather than recession; change leads to renascence rather than fall . different from the first round of reform driven by the conversion to a shareholding bank, the second round of reform , which was offi cially initiated in 2011, primarily focused on the dual advantages of management innovation, reshaping its strength as a large scale but fl exible policy and internal transformation development. the emphasis of reform turns from system optimisation to mechanism innovation.
the bank has recognised that strengthening the core competitiveness through releasing management vitality and deepening operational reform is the solution to addressing to the challenges and for the bank s future development. in 2012, the year of reform of the bank, we focused on reform in certain key aspects, such as performance assessment and management, the structure of front offi ce, operational process, products innovation and authorisation management. through relentless efforts, we have achieved periodical progress in the second round of reform , such as the successful establishment of sector management model, more rational and competitive incentive evaluation mechanism, better-positioned service network, the preliminary establishment of trinity operation pattern, the successful initiation of 531 project in certain branches and the banking department at the head offi ce, and the preliminary establishment of an it system based on accelerating business transformation the chinese banking industry is facing many challenges, such as china s economy slow-down, the substantial initiation of interest rate deregulation, the emergence of certain regional and industrial risks and the acceleration of fi nancial disintermediation. meanwhile, the regulators put forward stringent regulatory requirements towards the business growth, capital adequacy and risk management of commercial banks.
confronting multiple challenges, the bank proactively took the path of development driven by innovation and business transformation so as to seek growth via structural optimasation, improve competitiveness via growth and enhance growth vitality via innovation, and successfully developed new profi t sources such as the fi nancial market, custody services and offshore business. in 2012, the bank actively conducted innovative business activities in fi nancial market with a higher profi t margin in non-credit asset business compared with other banks. the bank also enjoyed a rapid growth in asset custody service. the scale of asset custody increased by 78.98% from the beginning of the year to rmb1,500 billion, among which the scale of pension custody exceeded rmb500 billion, making the bank the largest pension management bank in china. in terms of indicators of offshore business such as total assets, total profi t, lending balance and international settlement volume, the bank all ranked the top in the banking industry in china. in the future, the bank will accelerate its management transformation, continue to optimise its asset structure, business structure and income structure, and realise low-capital consumption and low-cost operation, and further upgrade the quality and effi ciency of its growth.
