prudent financial management has always underpinned the group s longterm success. the group s endeavours to maintain this pivotal fundamental principle are well reflected by its low gearing and healthy interest coverage ratio. as at 30 june 2016, the group s net debt to shareholders funds recorded a low 10.8% and its interest coverage achieved a high 12.5 times.

challenges including brexit and geopolitical tensions in many parts of the world are likely to continue weighing on the global economy and lead to volatility in the financial markets. however, the downside for the world economy is likely to be mitigated by policy actions, including the more accommodative monetary policies of most major central banks and positive fiscal measures in selected economies.
the group is confident about the medium- to long-term outlook of the mainland economy and its property market. economic momentum will be underpinned by the anticipated expansionary monetary and fiscal initiatives in the short term. moreover, the ongoing structural economic reforms will continue to proceed, lifting the overall productivity over time. these, together with continuous urbanization, will benefit property markets in key cities despite respective property control measures implemented in selected cities.
healthy labour market conditions and an improved residential market should underpin the hong kong economy amid a number of challenges in the year ahead, including sluggish external demand. the central government s supportive initiatives for hong kong, such as the recent approval of the shenzhen-hong kong stock connect, will further strengthen the city s long-term prospects as an international hub for finance, wealth management, business, trade and logistics. in the meantime, low interest rates, growing household income and the relatively high levels of new marriage and birth will continue to drive end-user demand for hong kong residential properties.
