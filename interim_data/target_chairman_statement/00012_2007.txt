miramar hotel and investment company, limited (44.21%-owned by the company) for the year ended 31 march 2007, miramar s turnover was approximately hk$1,434 million. excluding the contribution from its land-sales project in the us and the net increase in the fair value of its investment properties, the profi t before tax generated from its core businesses was hk$404 million, an increase of 18% over the previous year. profi t attributable to shareholders was approximately hk$688 million (hk$1,169 million for the previous miramar owned andor provided management services for eight hotels and serviced apartment complexes, whose aggregate turnover increased by 13% over the previous year and accounted for 34% of miramar s total profi t for the year. its fl agship, hotel miramar, maintained an occupancy rate at 90% with an increase of 17% in the average room rate. beginning from august 2007 and running through to the middle of 2008, a large-scale renovation plan will be carried out in phases, transforming hotel miramar into an upscale business hotel with an atmosphere of stylish miramar s property business reported an 8% growth in turnover in relation to its hong kong and china property assets (i.e., excluding its us property activities) and contributed around 60% of the total profi t for the company as a whole. a major contributor was its miramar shopping centre, which was in the process of improving its rental return following the completion of renovations and a realignment of the tenant mix. older leases drawn up during the property downturn expired during the year and were replaced with new ones refl ecting current market values. benefi ting from the improved economic climate, miramar tower (the offi ce tower above the miramar shopping centre) maintained an occupancy rate of around 90% with the rental increment achieved on new and renewed leases at around 70%. as the us property market slowed considerably during the year, miramar s overseas land- sales project in placer county, california was placed on hold, with no transactions recorded during the year. consequently, 80 acres (290 lots) of residential land and 70 acres of commercial land remain available for sale there.
during the year, miramar reengineered some aspects of its established food and beverage operations, moving into new areas that would generate greater public interest and patronage. its initiatives to build up the high-performing restaurant duo cuisine cuisine and lumiere were successful, while effi cient cost controls enabled other less high-profi le miramar outlets to accomplish returns in line with expenditure. as a result of these initiatives, aggregate turnover of its continuing food and beverage outlets over the year rose by around 8% despite keen competition.
as part of the restructuring of its travel business, successful travel professionals were recruited from within the industry and various new initiatives were launched. miramar travel, created in 2006, succeeded in boosting the customer numbers for its tour business by adding a number of new package tours and itineraries. miramar express, now responsible for commercial ticketing, car hires and cruise business, achieved a satisfactory performance as a result of its keen marketing efforts to the government and commercial sectors. it was also appointed by two leading international cruise lines, oceania and crystal, as their offi cial general agent in hong kong. turnover for the travel business grew by 44% over the previous year with a signifi cant shift back towards profitability.
the mtr corporation s recently announced plans to build a pedestrian subway linking the tsim sha tsui mtr station with the hotel miramar, the miramar shopping centre and their direct neighbour was a major coup for miramar. the new direct link will help to merge miramar s adjacent properties in a way that will enable the different components to fully complement each other, creating a truly mixed-use environment that will enhance returns.
the improved accessibility to tourists and shoppers will also serve to position the miramar site as a unique and prominent tsim sha with its approach focused on continuous modernisation, expansion and a readiness to explore new and exciting possibilities, the outlook for miramar is positive.
sunlight real estate investment trust in december 2006, the group disposed of its interests in eleven offi ce and retail (including car park) properties to sunlight real estate investment trust ( sunlight reit ) at a total consideration of approximately hk$1,099.3 million. units of sunlight reit were then listed on the main board of the stock exchange of hong kong limited on 21 december 2006 with approximately 4.5% of sunlight reit being held by the group as a result. sunlight reit currently owns a portfolio of 20 offi ce and retail properties in hong kong with an aggregate gross rentable area of approximately 1.29 million square feet. proceeds from the transaction were made available for use by the group in its operations and for new investment opportunities. this disposal also led to the group s business being further diversifi ed with the addition of a stable income source as its wholly-owned subsidiary, namely, henderson sunlight asset management limited, was appointed as the manager of sunlight reit.
issue of new shares on 10 november 2006, pursuant to a placing agreement, a subsidiary of henderson development limited (the controlling shareholder of the company) sold 128 million existing shares of the company at the placing price of hk$43.05 per share. pursuant to the placing agreement, the company then issued 128 million new shares to henderson development limited at the placing price adjusted for this purpose by the expenses incurred in relation to the placing and the subscription, raising net proceeds of approximately hk$5,508 million. the new shares represented approximately 7.05% of the company s then existing issued share capital and about 6.59% of its issued share capital as enlarged by the subscription. with an enlarged capital base, the group is in a better fi nancial position for future expansion, both in hong kong and mainland china.

the group has always adhered to sound and prudent financial management principles. at the end of the year, the group maintained a gearing ratio of net bank borrowings to shareholders funds of 9.5%. the group does not make use of any derivative instruments for speculative purposes. in respect of the group s operations in mainland china, apart from its capital and, in some cases, loan contributions to projects which are denominated in renminbi and are not hedged, the group endeavours to establish a natural hedge by maintaining an appropriate level of external borrowings in renminbi. apart from this, the group does not have any material foreign exchange at the beginning of the year under review, the group capitalized on the very favourable loan market conditions by concluding a hk$13.35 billion syndicated revolving credit facility carrying a fi ve-year maturity at an extremely attractive interest margin. this fi nancing transaction established a record in the local syndicated loan market at the time as the largest transaction for private sector borrowings ever raised in hong kong dollars, refl ecting the support and confi dence of the banking community in the group. also during the year, in respect of the international finance centre project jointly owned by the group, a non-recourse term loan facility carrying a fi ve-year maturity was signed in march for another record-breaking amount of hk$17.35 billion raised in the local syndicated loan market with very favourable terms.
to diversify the source of its funding, the group made an approach to the debt private placement markets in the united states and europe which resulted in the successful conclusion of a debut note issuance transaction in july 2007 for a total transaction size equivalent to us$425 million, with tranches carrying maturities of 7 years to 15 years. pricing for this transaction, which carries a weighted-average maturity of just over ten years, was benchmarked against the interest rate levels prevailing for comparable public bonds issued by hong kong top credit-rated companies. the transaction has contributed to lengthening the debt maturity profi le of the group. except for these notes totalling us$425 million (equivalent to approximately hk$3,312.4 million) which bear fi xed interest rates, the group s borrowings bear fl oating interest rates.

boosted by ongoing increases in both its external trade and domestic consumption, mainland china is expected to maintain robust economic growth. by capitalizing on its continuing and increasingly close ties with mainland china, the hong kong economy will grow from strength to strength. having benefi ted from the enormous business opportunities offered by the closer economic partnership arrangement (cepa), hong kong recently also served as the fi rst arena outside the mainland to initiate a renminbi bond market. with mainland asset management companies now allowed to operate in hong kong while mainland investors also permitted to invest directly in hong kong securities under the newly announced pilot scheme, hong kong s status as an international fi nancial centre will be further entrenched. the property market, as well as other business sectors in hong kong, will also benefi t from the improving economic fundamentals.
improved employment prospects, rising household incomes, favourable mortgage terms and reduced government stamp duty will boost the demand for housing. completion volumes for private residential units, however, are forecast to stay low for the years ahead. all these factors suggest that residential property prices will pick up steadily. in response to growing market demand, the group will embark on sales launches for a number of its development projects such as the sparkle and 33 lai chi kok road. some of its other popular projects including grand waterfront, the sherwood and the beverly hills will also be re-launched for sale. together with the sale of non-residential projects including midas plaza, 9-11 sheung hei street and 52 hung to road, these activities are expected to bring signifi cant revenue to the group.
rentals for shopping centres are expected to rise on the back of buoyant local consumption and tourist spending, while the strong demand for quality office space from the service sectors, in particular the fi nance sector, and from multinational corporations will also fuel further growth in offi ce rental rates. kwun tong 223, the landmark development in kowloon east equipped with state- of-the-art facilities and comprising over 1.0 million square feet of grade-a offi ce space, will be completed in the coming months, expanding the group s investment property portfolio in hong kong to 9.6 million square feet in terms of gross fl oor area. with higher rents for both new lettings and renewals, revenue for the group s existing property investment portfolio will continue to grow, whilst the gradual completion of the new rental properties will give an added boost to the group s recurring rental income.
also, amid the increasing visitor arrivals in hong kong, newton place hotel at kwun tong commenced business in july 2007, whilst the remaining three newton hotels have also completed the renovation for most of their guest rooms. the hotel operation is thus expected to provide greater contribution to the group.
in mainland china, the group s investment property portfolio is also set to expand. the cesar pelli designed world financial centre, an international grade-a offi ce complex in beijing, will soon be completed, in time for the opening of 2008 beijing olympics. in shanghai, four offi ce-cum-retail complexes, two of which have been designed by the acclaimed architects, kenzo tange associates of japan, are also scheduled for completion by 2009 or early 2010, ahead of the opening of world expo 2010 in shanghai. together with the higher revenue from existing rental properties such as offi ce tower ii of the grand gateway, rental income from the group s investment properties in mainland china is expected to grow strongly in the years to come.
hengli wanpan, a quality property development in guangzhou, achieved overwhelming success in its pre-sale and is expected to bring signifi cant returns to the group when it is completed in 2008. in view of the strong appetite for quality housing in mainland china, as well as the confidence of mainland homebuyers in the group s brand name, the group intends to expand its land bank in mainland china to a total attributable gross fl oor area of about 150 million square feet by the end of 2007. at the same time, the group will take active steps to develop the sites that it has already acquired. its objective is to ensure that the projects are not only well designed, but are completed on time, within budget and according to our quality standards, thereby further reinforcing henderson land s already strong reputation. the establishment of a mainland head offi ce in shenzhen and the strengthening of the construction team will provide further back up for the group s rapid business development on the mainland.
the group has built up a substantial investment property portfolio.
rising rental income from this portfolio together with increasing contributions from the group s listed associates have time and again provided a stable income base for the group. in addition, investment in mainland china, which has increased rapidly in the past two years, will become another important profi t driver. with the strategy adopted to develop the group s business in hong kong and mainland china concurrently, the market horizon for the group has broadened. this has resulted in further diversifi cation in the stable and growing income source of the group, positioning the group to face the future with confi dence. in the absence of unforeseen circumstances, the group will achieve satisfactory results in the coming fi nancial year.
