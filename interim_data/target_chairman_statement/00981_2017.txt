in 2016, we also commenced the construction of new fabs in shanghai, tianjin and shenzhen to prepare for the next phase of growth. this will bring sufficient flexibility to the group to meet the possible rapid growth in demand in the future. the actual expansion of production capacity will be determined and implemented based on prudent planning and a comprehensive consideration of three aspects, including customer demand, technology readiness and sustainable profitability.
the company announced a ten-to-one share consolidation during the second half of 2016 in order to reduce share price volatility and attract more interest from long-term investors. we believe that in the long run this will help attract more investors and further amass a broader shareholder base for the company.
