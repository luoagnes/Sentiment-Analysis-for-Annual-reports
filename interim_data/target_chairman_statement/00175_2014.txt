the performance of the group s export sales, however, was below our expectations, due to political instability in some of our major export markets and the weakening of emerging market currencies against both us$ and rmb. despite this, the group s sales performance in most of our export markets had been better than our competitors, enabling us to achieve higher market shares in most of our major export markets in 2013, reflecting the improved competitiveness of our products. the group s exports sales volume achieved a respectful 17% growth in 2013, boosting our total sales volume growth to 14% in 2013, compared to our original target of 16% growth and the 15% overall sales volume growth we achieved in 2012.

chairman s statement
chairman s statement geely automobile holdings limited annual report 2013 despite increasing challenges and fierce competition in both our domestic and export markets, we have significantly progressed the restructuring of our product development and sales and marketing functions, aiming at further enhancing the quality of our products and services and improving the efficiency of our sales and distribution capabilities. i have no doubt that the successful execution of these changes should bring about a much stronger geely in the near future.

the technological cooperation between the group and volvo car corporation ( volvo car ), which is majority owned by the group s parent zhejiang geely holding group limited ( geely holding ), has achieved significant progress during the year, enabling the group to further optimizing resource utilization, and speeding up the implementation of platform strategy, standardization, and shared modularization in product development, and thereby giving the group a strong and unique advantage over its competitors. i am confident that the synergy benefits for both companies could become increasingly obvious in the coming years, thus boding well for the group s competitive strength in the areas of technology, quality and brands.

although consumers in china have become increasingly demanding, thus putting tremendous pressure on automobile manufacturers to raise quality and improve customer satisfaction, there has been an interesting change in their mentality and consumption behavior recently, signaling a shift from excessive and brand-driven consumption to low- key and rational consumption. the chinese car buyers are now putting more focus on the contents, performance, specifications, environmental impact, energy efficiencies and safety of the vehicles they plan to purchase, i believe the trend could offer huge opportunities for the group s products in the future.

i firmly believe that the group is well positioned to achieve its long-term target of becoming a leading international automobile group with good reputation and integrity, winning respects from its customers. finally, i would like to pay tribute to all our staff for their hard work and achievements during 2013 and to our shareholders for their support.
