ebitda and ebit in 2015 were hk$1,637 million and hk$976 million respectively, an improvement of 9% and 11% respectively, compared to those in 2014. service ebitda (2) in 2015 improved by 9% to hk$1,329 million from hk$1,224 million in 2014 with corresponding service ebitda margin percentage (2) improved to 32% in 2015 from 26% in 2014, mainly as a result of continued focus on operational efficiency.

fixed-line service revenue in 2015 was hk$3,973 million, a decrease of 3% compared to hk$4,102 million in 2014. the decrease was mainly due to a 5% reduction in revenue in the international and local carrier market and 7% reduction in the residential market. the decline in revenue from the carrier market was mainly due to reduced demand for international direct dialing which was partially offset by gradual increase in data demand as a result of growing popularity of over-the-top ( ott ) applications and internet-of-things ( iot ) related devices. the decreases were partially offset by a 3% increase in revenue generated from the corporate and business market as a result of growth in demand of high speed data connectivity.
ebitda and ebit in 2015 were hk$1,274 million and hk$577 million respectively, reduced by 3% and 5% respectively, compared to those in 2014. ebitda margin maintained at 32% as a result of continued focus on the provision of high margin solution based offerings as well as savings from operational efficiency.
the group anticipates a strong need for sophisticated and advanced telecommunications network solutions to meet the customer demand in carrier, corporate and business markets. the group continues to focus on enhancing residential coverage and expanding wi-fi presence in coming years in order to cope with customers growing infotainment needs. with further technology development and a state-of-the-art network infrastructure including high speed optical fibre backbone network, advanced wi-fi presence and cloud-based platform, the group is in a solid position to capture further data demand and growth from the increasing popularity of ott applications and iot related devices.

against a backdrop of uncertainties in both local and international economies, the group is cautiously planning ahead. with the increasing popularity of viewing infotainment contents on smart devices, there is a growing need for one-stop lifestyle solutions. the group serves customers at home, on the move and in the workplace by integrating mobile, fixed-line and wi-fi networks to offer mobility, broadband, digital entertainment and fixed-line connectivity, at the same time expanding indoor and outdoor coverage in a seamless manner to generate more revenue, while enhancing shareholder value.
finally, i would like to take this opportunity to thank the board and all staff members for their dedication, professionalism and determination to succeed.
