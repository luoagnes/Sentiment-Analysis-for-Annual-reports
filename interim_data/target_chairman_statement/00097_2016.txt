discontinued operation infrastructure business hangzhou henderson qianjiang third bridge company, limited (the joint venture company ), a 60% owned subsidiary of the company, was engaged in the infrastructure business in mainland china with hangzhou qianjiang third bridge in zhejiang province as its core asset. hangzhou qianjiang third bridge, a major trunk route linking beijing and fujian province, is located on national highway no. 104 in zhejiang province, spanning approximately 5.8 km over the qiantangjiang river in hangzhou and connecting the urban parts of southern hangzhou, xiaoshan and binjiang.
the toll bridge is also an important nodal point for access to major roads leading to the hangzhou airport.
commencing from 20 march 2012, payment of the toll fee in respect of hangzhou qianjiang third bridge to the joint venture company was provisionally suspended. an arbitration application (the arbitration ) was thus filed by the joint venture company on 17 september 2012 with china international economic and trade arbitration commission ( cietac ) against mg]@slqqqp4x -|vu-n_ (hangzhou city urban public carpark construction & development centre, formerly known as mg]w v ] zs}t6e{tu or hangzhou city sizi engineering & highway general toll fee administration office, alias the hangzhou toll office ) as the first respondent and hangzhou municipal people s government ( hangzhou municipal government ) as the second respondent for an arbitral award that, inter alia, the first respondent and the second respondent should continue to perform their obligations under the agreement dated 5 february 2004 entered into between the joint venture company and the hangzhou toll office (the collection agreement ) by paying toll fees of hangzhou qianjiang third bridge to the joint venture company and be liable for the relevant outstanding toll fees together with the legal and arbitration costs incurred.
with the arrangement made by cietac, a mediation meeting was held in hangzhou at the end of march 2015. nation team development limited ( nation team , a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company) and mg]"_l nkj}t}qlqs ( prc jv partner ), with respective 60% and 40% interests in the joint venture company, had joined as additional parties acting as the second applicant and the third respondent to the arbitration respectively. on 30 april 2015, the arbitral tribunal of cietac issued the final arbitral award, which had legal binding effect on all parties to the arbitration and contains, among others, the following principal items: (i) hangzhou municipal government shall pay to nation team an amount of rmb376 million ( compensation payment ) within 90 days following the issue of the arbitral award. all tax payable in respect of the above payment ( prc tax ) in mainland china shall be borne and paid by hangzhou municipal government, which shall arrange for the prc tax clearance (ii) upon receipt by nation team of the compensation payment, the collection agreement and the agreement (-nyt}qmg]rw"_l nkj gplqst t) dated 8 january 1997 made between, amongst other, nation team and prc jv partner ( joint venture contract ) shall be discharged.
(iii) within five days following the receipt of the compensation payment, nation team shall pay to the joint venture company rmb2.2 million representing the legal expenses incurred by the joint venture company (subject to adjustment as to the final sum incurred by the joint venture company) in relation to (iv) nation team and hangzhou municipal government shall bear in equal shares the arbitration fees of approximately rmb2.5 million, and certain other mediation expenses of the arbitral tribunal amounting to approximately rmb25,000. nation team and hangzhou municipal government shall be responsible for the fees and expenses of the relevant arbitrator as a result of the above arbitral award, the group recognised a profit in the amount of hk$215 million (2014: loss of hk$54 million), which is equal to the compensation payment of rmb376 million as converted to hong kong dollars (net of the group s share of expenses relating to the arbitration) of hk$471 million and after (i) deducting the group s impairment loss on toll bridge operating right and related net assets of the joint venture company of hk$379 million (the joint venture company impairment ); (ii) recognising the reversal of the exchange reserve attributable to the joint venture company of hk$138 million; and (iii) deducting the operating loss of the infrastructure business in the aggregate amount of hk$15 million during the period from 1 january 2015 to 30 april 2015. adding back the group s non- controlling interests attributable share of the joint venture company impairment and operating loss in the aggregate amount of hk$140 million, the group recognised a one-off gain attributable to equity shareholders of the company in the amount of hk$355 million.
as the entire compensation payment was duly settled by hangzhou municipal government on 29 july 2015, the collection agreement and the joint venture contract were discharged and nation team has no further obligations, responsibilities and payment obligations for expenses whether as a shareholder of the joint venture company or in relation to the joint venture company or hangzhou qianjiang third bridge, and is no longer entitled to any income sharing and distribution rights as a shareholder of the joint venture continuing operation retailing business with the acquisition of the citistore business completed on 1 december 2014, its retailing operation has become the sole business of the group. currently, the group operates a department store business in six densely-populated residential districts under the name of citistore , whilst a specialty store has also been established in the tsim sha tsui shopping hub, offering a collection of apparel brands from japan and korea under the brand of id:c : due to a slowdown in inbound tourism, as well as weakened consumption sentiment arising from an uncertain economic outlook and exceptionally warm winter weather, retail sales in hong kong slackened distinctly in the fourth quarter of 2015, leading to a 3.7% drop in the value of total retail sales for the whole city during the year under review. nevertheless, by serving the daily household needs of local consumers, the group s citistore operation recorded only a slight decrease in the total sales proceeds (which were derived from the sales of own goods, as well as the consignment and concessionaire sales) of 0.7% for the year ended 31 december 2015 with its breakdown as follows: sales of own goods and gross margin citistore s sales of own goods retreated in the fourth quarter of 2015 due to the exceptionally warm weather in hong kong.
however, its total sales of own goods for the year under review amounted to hk$443 million, representing an increase of 3% over hk$431 million for the previous year. the household & toys category made up approximately 53% of the annual revenue from sales of goods, the apparel & accessories category contributed approximately 34% and the balance of approximately 13% came from the categories of cosmetics and food.
citistore regularly reviews its merchandise mix. having regard to market trends and consumer preferences, a wide range of highly sought-after products with better profit margins were introduced during the year under review. through keen promotional efforts and improved customer services, a stable gross margin of 36% was achieved along with increased sales: rental income from consignment and concessionaire counters citistore s concessionaire sales are conducted by licensing portions of shop spaces to its concessionaires for setting up their own concession counters to sell their products, whilst consignment sales comprise the sale of a consignor s own products on or in designated shelves, areas or spaces. these consignment and concessionaire counters are charged on the basis of revenue sharing or basic rent (if any), whichever is higher, which are recognised as citistore s rental income. during the year under review, the total rental income derived from these consignment and concessionaire counters was flat at hk$429 million compared with the previous year, despite the slight year-on-year drop in the total sales proceeds from these counters as follows: in summary, due to (i) the decrease in profit contribution in the fourth quarter of 2015 as a result of the exceptionally warm weather in hong kong; (ii) rental charges in the accounts being higher than the actual rental expenses in the early part of the tenure as a result of amortized rental expenses during the year based on the new 9-year tenancy lease agreements, which became effective in october 2014, with rent escalation for each 3-year period, and (iii) a one-off net gain of hk$17 million in the previous year from the reversal of rent-free amortization upon early termination of the preceding lease agreements, citistore s profit after taxation for the year ended 31 december 2015 amounted to hk$103 million, representing a decrease of 27% or hk$39 million as compared with the previous year.

at 31 december 2015, the group had no bank borrowings (2014: nil) and its net cash and bank balances amounted to hk$791 million (2014: hk$402 million).
considering that (i) for the discontinued operation, the above- mentioned compensation payment of rmb376 million was already fully converted into hong kong dollars and kept in leading banks in hong kong, and (ii) for the continuing operation, citistore solely focuses on the local market with less than 6% of its total purchases settled in foreign currencies, fluctuations in exchange rates are not expected to have any significant adverse impacts on the group s financial as the overall economy is expected to soften in the financial year ahead, the group will keep sourcing new merchandises, and improving the interior decoration and display of citistore so as to offer a fresh shopping experience to customers. the group will also continue to launch an array of innovative promotions and exercise stringent cost controls, thereby further enhancing the overall results of citistore.
