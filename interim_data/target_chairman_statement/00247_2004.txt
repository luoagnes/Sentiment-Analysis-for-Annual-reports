the hong kong economy has shown encouraging signs of a strong recovery since mid 2003, with gdp growth of 6.8% recorded in the fourth quarter of 2003, which rose by a further 12.1% in the second quarter of 2004 with full-year forecast of 7.5%. the high unemployment rate of 8.6% recorded in the quarter between may and july 2003 had fallen to 6.9% by the second quarter of 2004 with the deflationary spiral over. better economic and employment prospects coupled with low interest rates provided the necessary impetus to cause a resurgence of home- buyer confidence in the property market. against this backdrop, the demand for private residential housing has been strong. due to a combination of strong liquidity in the banking sector and the favourable mortgage interest rates offered by banks, property prices have experienced double-digit growth since the second quarter of 2003.
in july 2004, the hong kong mortgage corporation launched a new mortgage insurance programme which enables home buyers to obtain mortgage financing of up to 95% of the value of a property. this programme will further facilitate home purchase in the private housing sector.
retail sales and tourism and hotel industries also recorded encouraging growth as a result of better market sentiments and the implementation of the individual travel scheme by 30 cities in mainland china. visitor arrivals to hong kong have risen from its low level of slightly over 720,000 per month in june 2003 to an average of 1.6 million per month between july 2003 and june 2004. it is expected that visitor arrivals will reach 20 million for the full year of 2004 compared with 16.5 million and 15.5 million in 2002 and 2003 respectively.
as a result, our shopping malls such as china hong kong city, olympian city 1 and 2 and tuen mun town plaza,(which account for the substantial portion of total gross rental income), have experienced a substantial increase in shopper a total of approximately 600,000 square feet of retail space, following the completion of five major projects in tsuen wan town centre redevelopment site, yeung uk road (tsuen wan) site, west kowloon reclamation site, ho tung lau site and oceania heights (tuen mun) in the next three financial years will add to our already substantial rental portfolio, enhancing future rental income.
given the strong economic fundamentals, healthy sustainable growth in the property market and our development land bank of 11.5 million square feet mainly acquired between 2000 and the first half of 2004 (not including our completed investment properties and properties held for sale), we are confident that the group stands poised for yet further growth in the coming years.

on behalf of the board, i would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation to all staff for their commitment, dedication and continuing support.
i would also like to express my gratitude to my fellow directors for their guidance and wise counsel.
