review for the year a continuing deceleration in growth of the global economy in 2015, with the pace of growth varied across different economies, means the road to recovery remained bumpy. on one hand, steady global price level, improving employment environment and an active merger and acquisitions market were seen; on the other hand, the world was prevailed with an intensifying volatility in global financial markets, a record- high debt level across the board, subdued commodity prices, and the prevalence of trade protectionism and currency competition. in its latest world economic outlook report published in january 2016, the international monetary fund ( imf ) suggested that global economy grew by 3.1% in 2015, down 0.3 percentage point from that in 2014, within which advanced economies rebounded by 1.9% with a slowing pace, while developing economies grew by 4.0%, down 0.6 percentage point year-on-year. world trade volume (including goods and services) grew by 2.6% in 2015, 0.8 percentage point lower than that in 2014.
entering into the new normal, china s economy showed a generally steady trend in 2015, with an overall stable growth and an improvement in both economic structure and quality of growth. china s gdp grew by 6.9% for the year, which was broadly in line with the target set at the beginning of the year. in tandem with the soft external demand and the decline in commodity prices, negative growth was seen in china s total export and import value, with total trade value amounting to us$3.96 trillion, a decrease of 8.0% over that of 2014. container throughput handled by chinese ports of significant scale totaled 210 million teus during 2015, representing a year-on-year increase of 4.1%, or a decrease of 2.2 percentage points over that of 2014 in growth rate.
generally speaking, 2015 was a year presented with a muted and slowing growth picture for the global ports industry, yet the group s ports operation was able to outperform the industry by registering a total container throughput of 83.66 million teus, which represented a 3.5% year-on-year rise.
bulk cargo handling operations recorded a throughput of 353 million tonnes, a decrease of 2.8% year-on-year. looking into the regional performance, container throughput handled by the group s ports in mainland china totaled 61.47 million teus, up 3.2% year-on-year, a growth rate higher than that of foreign trade-derived container throughput handled by china s ports. ports in hong kong and taiwan handled a combined container throughput of 6.14 million teus, a decrease of 15.0% year-on-year, while overseas operations was showing a solid growth of 14.2% on a year-on-year basis, delivering a container throughput of 16.05 million teus. among the major ports in the group s portfolio, shanghai international port (group) co., ltd., handling a container throughput of 36.54 million teus, or a year-on- year increase of 3.6% in 2015, continued to be the world s largest operator for six consecutive years. attributing to the decline in domestic volume as a result of the facilitation of business upgrade and transformation, container throughput handled by the group s terminals in west shenzhen was 10.75 million teus, down slightly by 2.5% year-on-year. in the overseas arena, cict in sri lanka delivered a noticeable growth of 127.5% year-on-year, handling 1.56 million teus, while lom container terminal s.a.

the phase 2 work of tonggu channel involving its further widening, to be completed by early 2017, progressed as planned, and is expected to become a fulcrum for west shenzhen port zone in accommodating mega-vessels.
operating efficiency of the port has been enhanced with the improvement of its customs environment, which came along with the amalgamation of custom zones and introduction of innovative custom supervision modes within qianhai-shekou free trade zone. synchronization of operations within chiwan and shekou port zones was further facilitated, which went one step further by integrating the container operations of china merchants port services (shenzhen) co., ltd. the transformation of shenzhen haixing harbor development co., ltd. into a container terminal, with preliminary work completed and with construction commencing in 2016, will also be crucial in the establishment of a modern port zone that is automated, intelligent, green and low carbon; the building of a smart port ecosystem; the improvement in asset s efficiency and the promotion of business innovation of the group s homebase port.
as for the group s port network in china, aiming towards optimising existing assets, extending market influence and enhancing synergies , the group has been proactively seeking to identify new investment and cooperation opportunities by capitalizing on the potential consolidation and reforms among coastal ports in china, as signified by the share subscription agreement entered into between the group and dalian port on 12 january 2016, allowing the group to become the second largest shareholder of dalian port, which represented a great leap forward by the group in optimising its port network and consolidating port assets in as for overseas strategies, leveraging on the historic opportunities offered by the one belt, one road strategy promoted by china, a tripartite consortium formed between the group, cosco pacific and cic capital has acquired a 65% equity interest of kumport in turkey in december 2015, complementing the group s global port network layout, whilst enabling the group to pre-position for the economic development brought about by the implementation of china s one belt, one road strategy. during the year, the group s overseas projects, contributing 19.2% of its total container throughput, or an increase of 1.8 percentage points over that of last year, has become a core growth driver of the group.

in 2016, global economy is expected to demonstrate a slow pickup in growth, with the presence of several unfavourable cyclical and structural factors adding further uncertainty.
according to the latest forecast published by imf, global economy is forecasted to grow by 3.4% in 2016, up 0.3 percentage point from that in 2015, while world trade volume (including goods and services) is projected to grow by 3.4% in 2016, an increase of 0.8 percentage point from 2015. growth pace in china s economy is expected to be milder in 2016 as structural economic adjustments and against the backdrop of a feeble global economic recovery and the chinese economy entering into the new normal, the global port industry is again anticipating a picture of slow growth in 2016 with performance varying across regions.
on top of all these, the persistence of a supply glut in the shipping industry, the deployment of mega-vessels, the prevalence of shipping alliances and the intensifying regional competition of ports all pose challenges to the port industry.
thanks to the stability displayed at the ports in china and the impetus from the faster growth at existing overseas projects, compounding with the additional contributions from potential acquisitions and new growth drivers through nurturing innovative business, the group s ports operation is expected to remain steady in 2016.
