the euro-zone debt crisis sent the world economy reeling, whilst the geopolitics in the middle east and northern africa regions remained fragile. the economy of japan was hardly hit by the earthquake and tsunami, whilst the pace of recovery in the united states appeared to be slow. meanwhile, the tightened monetary policies and the macroeconomic control measures to cool off the real estate sector hampered the growth of china s economy.

looking ahead, china, being the second largest economy in the world, will undoubtedly play a more important role in the global economy, although china s own economic development is still subject to a lot of uncertainties and instabilities both externally and internally. china will lead the developing and emerging economies to drive the recovery and growth of the global economy in the years ahead.
it is the chinese government s long-term objective to maintain a relatively fast economic growth. in the meantime, the government will use its best endeavors to restructure the economy. in light of this, the contribution from domestic consumption to china s economic growth will continue to play an important role in the foreseeable future. a series of measures such as increasing income levels, reducing taxation and perfecting social security system with an aim to expand domestic consumption are gradually achieving results. the rise of the middle class and the acceleration of the urbanisation process will further facilitate the growth of the overall retail industry.
