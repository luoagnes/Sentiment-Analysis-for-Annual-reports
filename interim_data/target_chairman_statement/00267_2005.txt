our company not only made a significant gain in terms of profit growth in 2004, but also made progress in implementing our long term plans to expand our growing investment in the key sectors of the chinese economy in which we have particular skills.

in january 2004 c itic pacific purchased 20% of north united power corporation, which generates power for inner mongolia and the surrounding provinces and has ready supplies of coal nearby. through 2004 construction of the ligang power station phase iii (2 x 600mw) and phase iv (2 x 600mw) and the zhengzhou phase iii (2 x 200mw) progressed according to plans leading to commercial operation in 2006 and 2007. in addition, an equal partnership of c itic pacific and china huaneng power group acquired a 40% stake in the hanfeng power plant (2 x 660mw) located in hebei province in 2004.
today, c itic pacific has 2,916mw of attributable generating capacity, which will rise to 5,083mw on completion of the plants under the substantial increase in electricity generated by our power plants in 2004 compared with 2003 is evidence that demand for electric power remains strong in mainland china. our belief is that as the chinese economy continues to grow, the current low per capita consumption of power will rise, requiring a considerable increase in generating capacity.
with our many years of experience and expertise in building and operating power stations in mainland china, c itic pacific is ideally placed to contribute to meeting the demand.
during 2004 there was a significant increase in the price of coal and obtaining a sufficient supply was a challenge to which management responded well by securing long-term supply contracts.
special steel manufacturing demand for high quality special steel products remain strong and our jiangyin xingcheng steel plant produced a record 1.76 million tonnes in 2004, 1.58 million tonnes was for domestic consumption and 182,040 tonnes was exported. jiangyin xingcheng continues to be a leader in the manufacture of special steel in china. to enhance its leading position in the special steel industry, jiangyin xingcheng is proceeding to cooperate with sumitomo metals kokura to produce high-grade special steel primarily substituting existing imported auto-component grade steel.
in october 2004, c itic pacific acquired a 95% stake in the hubei xin yegang co. (formerly dongfang iron and steel co.) in huangshi, hubei province,through which other assets were acquired including an interest in the shenzhen stock exchange listed daye special steel co..subject to regulatory approval, our interest in this company will increase to approximately 58%. in 2004,these plants manufactured approximately 1.73 million tonnes of steel.these acquisitions will strengthen our leading position in china s special steel market by expanding our product range and geographical coverage.
our major customers are in the auto-component, power equipment, and machine tool industries where underlying demand is expected to grow considerably in the coming decade giving confidence in the future of the special steel sector.

air china cargo began official operation in january 2004 and had a profitable first year.
