employee and remuneration policies as at 31 december 2011, the group had around 1700 full-time employees which included management and administrative staff and production workers. most of them were stationed in mainland china while the rest were in hong kong. the remuneration, promotion and salary increments of employees are assessed according to the individual s performance, as well as professional and working experience, and in accordance with prevailing industry practices.

in view of (i) the escalating awareness for a more stringent environmental protection and product safety laws and regulations pertaining to the group s manufacturing facilities and products in the prc; (ii) the public perception of the pollutive nature of the paint and coating manufacturing industry; (iii) increase in price of crude oil, other key raw materials and labour costs, growing market competition of paint and petrochemical products worldwide; (iv) an increase in the capital expenditure for replacement of ageing production facilities; (v) escalating labour and production costs as a result of the difficulty in hiring staff for the environmentally sensitive paint manufacturing business; (vi) increase in cost in order to ensure the coating business complies with relevant laws and regulations, in particular those regarding hazardous substances and environmental safety and (vii) the substantial capital outlay and maintenance costs for the relocation of the existing manufacturing and storage facilities from shenzhen to a more remote location at zhong xin town, zencheng, guangzhou, and as well as the worsening economic environment, the management expects future results and cash flow of the paint and petrochemical products will be adversely affected. as the result, the management considers to dispose of the paint and petrochemical products segment and re-allocate the existing resources of the group (including but not limited to disposal) to the led and semi-conductor lighting business.

the lighting business is considered as one of the fastest growing industries worldwide. it has strong support from the prc government and the local demand of led products is increasing drastically. however, given the technology of led is becoming more common nowadays, the technology barrier is lower than before and more new competitors have entered into the led market in the prc causing persistent decrease in the level of prices of led related products. to cope with the foreseeable potential competition from new competitors, the group will try its best endeavour to reduce the production costs of the led related products in the followings aspects: i) to expand its production scale and obtain the cost advantage; and ii) to reduce costs through technological innovation. the group is considering to allocate additional resources on research and development of new led related products and technology such that the group can lower the production costs and differentiate itself from its competitors in the led market. furthermore, the group will carry out marketing campaign to strengthen its brand image for lighting business to attract new customers. as the acquisition of the lighting business was just completed on 17 march 2011, additional time is required to improve its operating performance in order to achieve satisfactory results in the long run.
meanwhile, the group will from time to time seek for other investment opportunities in other business streams with promising prospect and companies with profitability track record such that the income base of the group could be broaden. as at the report date, the group has not yet identified any suitable investment opportunities. besides, the company will keep looking for fund raising opportunities to further strengthen the financial position of the group as and when necessary. as at the report date, other than the open offer announced by the company dated 13 february 2012, the company has not yet identified any fund raising opportunities.
