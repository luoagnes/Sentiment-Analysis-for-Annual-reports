to our shareholders, subsequent to the unprecedented capital accumulation and technological advancement in major economies around the world resulting from the industrial revolution, many traditional enterprises found their further development stumbled by difficulties involved in sustainably developing, soundly organising, effectively controlling and managing such rich resources. under the epochal theory of scientific management proposed in the nineteenth century by frederick taylor, an american scholar in classical management, a scientific and standardised management system may be applied to review the existing workflows of an enterprise, identify the rules for operations and actions, formulate scientific manufacturing processes, and use standardisation as a way to streamline procedures and systems. additionally, employees are trained so that they grow in their respective areas to enhance the production efficiency of the enterprise as a whole. this will in turn form the basis on which employers and employees build up their wealth together, and the organisation will become highly united, thereby achieving its goals and targets.
such notions proposed by frederick taylor contributed significantly to the key stage of transition of enterprise management from small-scale and hereditary to largescale for many successful enterprises in a traditional chinese or oriental society, exceptional visions and personal talents may make an outstanding leader the core cohesive force driving the whole organisation to move forward.
however, a model of management dominated by personal success as such may give rise to the key concerns of perpetual development and sustainability of efficiency of an enterprise. any leader of any great vigor must face the passage of time and change of era. this is the universal truth and necessarily challenges the development of such 6 new world development company limited chairman s statement an incompetent leader makes the best out of his own ability; a fair leader makes the best out of others efforts; a brilliant leader makes the best out of others wisdoms , said han feizi, an ancient chinese philosopher. in other words, a good leader shall be good at pooling together wisdoms in addition to efforts, to drive motivation for the sound management of a country with collective mental competence. the western style of management of modern enterprises in a scientific approach further enlightens the traditional chinese wisdoms on management.
based upon statutory powers, a modern enterprise establishes its internal management system with clearlydefined functions. workflows are handled in a standardised and scientific way, to stress accuracy, perpetuity, disciplines, sternness and reliability within an organisational structure using the golden rules of division of labour and hiring of the best talents. as such, each and every segment of an enterprise is led to the same direction, and employees are therefore steered to the same clear goals and values, delivering the best performance under the spirit of unity, and sharing the fruits of accomplishments of the enterprise. this lays a solid foundation for the longterm development of an enterprise, to support its ongoing since its establishment in 1970, new world group has accumulated extensive experience and established a strong base in different areas of property development.
