beijing oriental plaza celebrated 15th anniversary since its opening in 2000, beijing oriental plaza has established itself as the landmark of beijing. located in wangfujing, the 800,000-square metre mixed-use development comprises a 130,000-square metre shopping centre, eight grade a offi ces towers, two serviced apartment towers, and a fi ve-star hotel, grand hyatt beijing. these four components are part and parcel to the success of the property complex, refl ecting the world within a world self- contained community concept.
in the past 15 years, beijing oriental plaza has a track record of high occupancy rates and solid fi nancial position.
these achievements have laid a strong foundation, enabling beijing oriental plaza to maintain growth momentum.

acquisition of chongqing metropolitan plaza on 2 march 2015, the acquisition of chongqing metropolitan plaza was completed. located in jiefangbei s central business district, the 164,000-square metre mixed-use project has immediately contributed to hui xian reit s revenue. it has been offi cially rebranded as chongqing metropolitan oriental plaza , the second project under hui xian reit s oriental plaza brand.
following the acquisition, areas under hui xian reit s management have now increased to over one million square metres across three cities in china, namely beijing, chongqing and shenyang.
rmb exchange rate in 2015 in 2015, rmb exchange rate saw signifi cant fl uctuation. the rmb exchange rate against hong kong dollars dropped approximately 5.8%* compared to a year ago.
all of hui xian reit s existing projects are located in china, generating revenue in rmb. hui xian reit s fi nancial statements are presented in rmb and the distribution to unitholders is also in rmb. rmb exchange rate volatility does not have a signifi cant impact on the performance of hui xian reit s projects. however, hui xian reit s current borrowings are in hong kong dollars. the rmb exposure may appear when the exchange gain or loss is realised upon loan repayment.
investment sentiment, nonetheless, could be adversely affected by rmb s exchange fl uctuation. according to hong kong monetary authority, the rmb deposits in hong kong as at the end of december 2015 shrank to approximately rmb851 billion, representing a drop of 15% compared to the amount as at the end of december 2014.

at the macro level, china s luxury retail sector continued to face strong headwinds throughout 2015. the central government s anti-extravagance campaign continued. meanwhile, popularity in online shopping and overseas shopping continued to grow.
hit by slumping sales of luxury goods, some international brands consolidated their shop networks and closed down stores in some cities. retailers have taken a more cautious approach towards store opening. this affected the occupancy rates and rental reversions of many shopping malls in china. some landlords even turned retail premises into offi ce leasing space.
