chairman s s tatement the year s results the performance of the group s gas business in hong kong remained steady in 2013. in comparison, the group s city-gas businesses in mainland china thrived, continuing to record good profit growth; concurrently energy businesses are being developed at a fast pace. the group s overall recurrent businesses recorded good results in 2013.
profit after taxation attributable to shareholders of the group for the year amounted to hk$6,854 million, a decrease of hk$858 million compared to 2012. earnings per share for the year amounted to hk71.7 cents. exclusive of the group s share of a revaluation surplus from investment properties and a one-off net gain, the group s profit after taxation for the year increased by hk$767 million to hk$6,680 million, an increase of 13 per cent compared to 2012 mainly attributable to a rise in profit from the group s local businesses and mainland utility businesses.
during the year under review, the group invested hk$5,294 million in production facilities, pipelines, plants and other fixed assets for the sustainable development of its various existing and new businesses in hong kong and mainland china.
gas business in
the local economy continued to grow moderately in 2013. tourism, restaurant and hotel sectors, all still benefiting from an increase in the number of inbound tourists, continued to prosper. as a result, commercial and industrial gas sales achieved good growth in 2013. however, as the average temperature in the first quarter of 2013 in hong kong was slightly higher than the same period in 2012, residential gas sales were affected. overall, total volume of gas sales in hong kong for the year increased slightly by approximately 0.7 per cent to 28,556 million mj whereas appliance sales increased by approximately 3.3 per cent, both compared to 2012.
as at the end of 2013, the number of customers was 1,798,731, an increase of 22,371 compared in mainland china the group s mainland businesses progressed well in 2013 in respect of the number of projects and the mainland economy continued to grow steadily during 2013 maintaining an annual growth rate similar to that of 2012. the group s city-gas and natural gas businesses, benefiting from both on-going economic advancement of the country and a significant increase in production, import volume and consumption of natural gas on the mainland, recorded continuous growth during 2013. the group s development of emerging projects and related research and development of new technologies, through its wholly-owned subsidiary eco environmental investments limited and the latter s subsidiaries (together known as eco ), are progressing well. a number of projects are now at various stages of investment, construction and gradual commissioning which is laying a new foundation for the long-term development of the group s businesses.
the chinese government is proactively advocating urbanisation which is favourable to the development of utility businesses.
with regard to environmental protection, a natural gas utilisation policy, formulated to improve air quality, is encouraging faster exploration and utilisation of natural gas. therefore it is expected that there will be increasing demand for clean energy in mainland china in the long run.
this, coupled with increasing upstream natural gas supplies, is creating good prospects and investment value for the group s mainland city-gas and emerging energy businesses. in addition, following the development of its telecommunications businesses in hong kong and the mainland over the last few years, several data centre and telecommunications conduit system project companies have since been established, which are now contributing to ever-more diversification of the group s businesses.
overall, inclusive of projects of the group s subsidiary, towngas china company limited ( towngas china ; stock code: 1083.hk), the group had 173 projects on the mainland, as at the end of 2013, 23 more than at the end of 2012, spread across 22 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities. these projects encompass upstream, midstream and downstream natural gas sectors, water sectors, applications, energy resources exploration and utilisation, as well diversification and an increase in the number of projects are gradually transforming the group from a locally-based company in hong kong centred on a single business into a sizable, nation-wide, multi-business corporation with a focus on environmentally-friendly energy ventures and utility sectors.

in mainland china the group s city-gas businesses are progressing well with a total of 15 new projects added to its portfolio in 2013, including one located in economically vibrant hangzhou city, the provincial capital of zhejiang province and a world famous tourist city with great potential for growth in the number of customers and increase in gas consumption.
as at the end of 2013, inclusive of towngas china, the group had a total of 119 city-gas projects in mainland cities spread across 20 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities. the total volume of gas sales for these projects in 2013 was approximately 13,400 million cubic metres, an increase of 13 per cent over 2012. as at the end of 2013, the group s mainland gas customers stood at approximately 17.29 million, an increase of 17 per cent over 2012.
the group continues to be a large-scale city-gas enterprise with outstanding performance on the a rise in the gate price of natural gas for non-residential use, following the implementation of natural gas price reform on the mainland in july 2013, has impacted demand in the commercial and industrial gas market in the short term. however, in the medium to long term, natural gas is still projected to be the clean energy of choice on the mainland for reducing pollutant emissions to improve foggy atmospheric conditions. with gradual commissioning of the country s large-scale natural gas projects including transmission pipelines from sichuan province to eastern and southern china and phase two of the west-to-east pipeline, and pipeline projects for importing natural gas from central asia and burma coming on stream, as well as a rise in the quantity of imported and domestic liquefied natural gas ( lng ), supply of natural gas on the mainland is increasing. thus, with increasing sources of gas supply, expanding pipeline networks and the public s aspiration for greater environmental protection, the group anticipates its mainland city-gas businesses will continue to thrive in the future.
the group s midstream natural gas projects are making good progress.
these include natural gas pipeline projects in anhui province, in hebei province and in hangzhou city, zhejiang province; natural gas extension projects in jilin and henan provinces; the guangdong lng receiving terminal project; and towngas china s midstream pipeline project located in wafangdian, dalian city, liaoning province. these kinds of high-pressure, natural gas pipeline projects generate good returns and help the group develop its downstream city-gas markets.
the group has so far invested in, and operates, six water projects, including water supply joint venture projects in wujiang district, suzhou city, jiangsu province and in wuhu city, anhui province; a whollyowned water supply project in zhengpugang xin qu, maanshan city, anhui province; an integrated water supply and wastewater joint venture project, together with an integrated wastewater treatment project for a special industry, both in suzhou industrial park, suzhou city, jiangsu province; and a water supply project in the starting area of jiangbei concentration zone, wuhu city, anhui province, acquired in december 2013. with increasing demand for clean water resources across the country, the group s water projects are progressing well, with steady growth in volume of operation and management of businesses encompassing city-gas, city-water and midstream natural gas projects create positive synergy and mutual advantages.
furthermore, these businesses generate stable income and provide good environmental benefits, with room for expansion. the group will therefore keep on looking for opportunities to invest in high-quality utility projects on eco s two major businesses in hong kong an aviation fuel facility servicing hong kong international airport, and dedicated liquefied petroleum gas ( lpg ) vehicular filling stations are operating smoothly. total turnover for the aviation fuel facility for 2013 was 5.56 million tonnes, providing a safe and reliable fuel supply to hong kong international airport and continuing to contribute to eco s steady profit growth. profit margins for the lpg refilling station business for 2013 were significantly higher than those of 2012.
haze and air pollution on the mainland are a growing concern.
the chinese government is therefore increasing its efforts to promote the utilisation of natural gas with the aim to improve air quality. developing refilling station networks supplying lng as a fuel for vehicles and vessels, and gradually replacing diesel as a fuel for heavy-duty trucks, are gaining momentum. in response to this trend, eco has started to reinforce its lng supply capacity with unconventional gas resources such as coalbed gas and coke oven gas. eco s coalbed methane liquefaction facility, located in jincheng city, shanxi province, is operating smoothly and its liquefied products selling prices have risen significantly, benefiting from a recent upward adjustment of the gate price of natural gas on the mainland, thus creating good prospects for this business. eco is now seeking more natural gas and coalbed gas supply sources on the mainland in order to expand its liquefaction capacity and extend its in addition, eco has recently endeavoured to speed up its negotiations with several coking plants to conclude long-term supply agreements of coke oven gas to be used for producing lng through methanation and then liquefaction.
preparatory work for eco s first project of this kind, located in xuzhou city, jiangsu province, has commenced; commissioning is expected in the first half of 2015.
a similar project located in jiexiu city, shanxi province, is also expected to be concluded in the near future; construction will then when eco extended its business into the mainland in 2008, its first project was the construction of a compressed natural gas refilling station for heavy-duty trucks in shaanxi province. after several years of development, a network of eco natural gas refilling stations has gradually taken shape in provinces including shaanxi, shandong, shanxi, henan and liaoning. eco is also now planning to provide lng refilling facilities for incoming and outgoing heavy-duty trucks and river transport vessels at the logistics port of jining city, shandong province a port which links an upstream railway with the nearby downstream beijing-hangzhou canal. all in all, eco currently has 25 refilling stations in operation, under planning or construction, and further expansion of this business into other provinces is actively in progress. as the number of refilling stations increases, the eco brand name will gradually become more well-known in the market.
in view of a worldwide shortage and rising prices of petroleum, the country is developing alternative substitutes at a faster pace in order to reduce its reliance on importing crude oil. eco is proactively studying the utilisation of innovative resource conversion technologies to produce high value-added, and environmentallyfriendly, energy. it is making progress with converting low-value raw materials into high value-added energy and related research and development work has shown promising results recently, which could help strengthen eco s competitive edge in this new energy sector in future. eco has completed testing verification for upgrading plant fatty-acids (palm oil residue) to petrol or diesel and has applied for a patent for this technology.
the company s first project in this field, with an annual capacity to upgrade 150,000 tonnes of plant fatty-acid and to be located in the chemical industrial park of zhangjiagang city, jiangsu province, will be an important step forward in developing eco s biomass energy eco s methanol production plant in inner mongolia finished trial production in late 2013 and has been running smoothly since commissioning. methanol, a good chemical feedstock, can be further processed into the high value-added products of olefin and paraffin using cracking and polymerisation techniques. eco s self-developed technology can upgrade methanol into high value-added products which can substitute for gasoline, and this has also led to the commencement of a new project in inner mongolia to upgrade methanol into 140,000 tonnes of high-quality gasoline substitute, an important milestone for eco s methanol upgrading business.
this project is expected to be commissioned before the end with regard to eco s upstream resources business, the operation of the oilfield project in thailand is relatively stable, now mainly focusing on stepping up exploration activities so as to optimise oil drilling plans. in contrast, coal mining businesses in inner mongolia have suffered as the decrease in demand for coal on the mainland has adversely impacted direct sales. however, the group s investment in coal mine exploration is not substantial. in the long term, such businesses will help towards stabilising material costs in the group s utilisation of coal for clean energy.

(stock code: 1083.hk) towngas china, a subsidiary of the group, continued to record good growth in profit after taxation attributable to its shareholders, amounting to hk$1,106 million in 2013, an increase of approximately 32 per cent over 2012. as at the end of december 2013, the group had an approximately 62.31 per cent interest in towngas china.
towngas china is also progressing well with project development. it acquired 14 new piped-gas projects in 2013 located in zhengpugang xin qu modern industrial zone, maanshan city, in fanchang county, wuhu city and in bozhou-wuhu modern industrial zone, bozhou city all in anhui province; in cang county, in mengcun hui autonomous county and in yanshan county, all in cangzhou city, and in shijiazhuang southern industrial zone all in hebei province; in the economic development zone, boxing county, binzhou city and in shiheng town, feicheng city both in shandong province; in mianzhu city, sichuan province; in dafeng city, jiangsu province; in fengxi district, chaozhou city, guangdong province; in jianping county, liaoning province; and zhongwei piped city-gas project in guangxi zhuang autonomous region.
to capture investment opportunities resulting from both the mainland s commitment to promote the utilisation of natural gas during the period of the twelfth five-year plan (2011 2015) and from related national policies which facilitate sustainable growth of city-gas businesses, towngas china will continue to both increase its investment in city-gas industries and proactively develop new town gas network and facilities in hong kong the network supply capability of the company is expanding at a good pace in line with market growth.
several network development projects are in progress to meet laying of a 15 km pipeline to bring natural gas from tai po to ma tau kok gas production plant, to partially replace naphtha as feedstock for the production of town gas, was substantially completed in 2013. modification of associated stations and ma tau kok plant s facilities is progressing to cope with the natural gas supply.
commissioning of the pipeline is expected in the third quarter of 2014. construction of a 9 km pipeline in the western new territories to strengthen supply capability and reliability is more than halfway complete. in tandem with the government s development of west kowloon and south east kowloon, network planning, design and construction in these locations are underway. the gas supply pipeline to the kai tak cruise terminal was commissioned in mid-2013. construction of pipelines to supply a large housing development at anderson road in east kowloon, which is now at the planning stage, has commenced.
construction of a new submarine pipeline from ma tau kok to north point is progressing well with commissioning expected in the coming year.
the group will constantly allocate resources towards renovating hong kong s town gas network to ensure safety of the whole system and a reliable supply.

the company predicts steady growth in the number of customers in hong kong during 2014.
restaurant, hotel and retail sectors in hong kong are all benefiting from a prospering tourism industry.
nevertheless, the local economy is expected to continue to be affected by the uncertain global economic outlook. in hong kong, operating costs for all business sectors are increasing. however, an increase in the standard gas tariff with effect from 1st april 2013 is offsetting some of the company s own rising operating costs. the company will continue to enhance its operational efficiency so as to maintain stable development of its gas business in in mainland china, the government is advocating increasing urbanisation and is endeavouring to optimise its energy mix and to promote energy conservation, emission reductions and utilisation of clean energy to improve air quality. combined with the state s advocate of expanding domestic consumption of goods and services to boost economic growth, it is anticipated that there will be a continuing rise in demand for utility services and energy.
recent natural gas price reform better reflects the market situation on the mainland and favours a healthier development of the natural gas business sector in the long term. the group s city-gas and natural gas businesses on the mainland are therefore expected to continue to achieve good growth. in respect of emerging businesses, following the chinese government s move towards greater energy diversification, environmental protection and the creation of a more circular economy, there is a trend for the continuous development of new application technologies and use of low-sulfur, high-quality oil and natural gas as fuels for vehicles and vessels, to reduce atmospheric pollution. this trend is beginning to ignite a new light illuminating the way for the group s long-term development of its emerging energy businesses and business with the group s solid foundation in hong kong and its diverse business sectors spread across extensive areas on the mainland, together with its successful corporate brand names and sales channels built there over the last 20 years, and the mainland s rising concern over air quality and an anticipated rising demand for clean energy, coupled with a sizeable customer base of over 19 million in hong kong and mainland china for its piped-gas business amid an expanding business coverage ensuring a promising return, the group predicts good prospects and an even broader and better future for all its businesses in the years lee shau kee
