economy remained on the recovery track and sustained growth momentum on the back of lower energy cost and reflux of global funds. the eu economy turned stable amid a downtrend but was plagued by such issues as high unemployment, low inflation, structural conflicts and its battered economic and trading ties with russia, in turn dampening the region s recovery.

the country has become a key player in the global arena and the central government has proactively kicked off infrastructure projects around the world, in particular cross-border express rail projects as a move to develop a worldwide express rail network. under the strategic idea of the maritime silk road of the 21st century , the one belt and one road initiative will be an excellent channel for outflow of funds from china, in turn easing the overcapacity concern in the mainland and supporting its export. in addition, the set up of the asian infrastructure investment bank will place china in the leading position among the national development banks of the bric countries and the asian investment banks. the move is propitious to the going global strategy of mainland enterprises and also to china s economic growth. in terms of external investment, china has doubled the scale to over us$100 billion within 5 years and its marshall plan is currently at play in the whole world.
