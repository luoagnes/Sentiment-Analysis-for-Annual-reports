chairman and president
2009 witnessed the most difficult period for gome electrical appliances holding limited (the company ) together with its subsidiaries (collectively known as the group or gome ) to date since its initial listing. amid the contraction of china s economy and the shattering of consumer confidence during the global economic crisis, an unfavorable event involving the founder of the company unfolded as we marched into 2009. gome was put to the test in the harshest of ways and had to prove whether the company could survive and grow again. a year later, i am glad to say that gome triumphed over this adversity and set out on a path of healthy development. despite the impact this severe corporate crisis had on our company, we moved on and passed the test with flying colors, ending up with a stronger, more professional and united management team. we also realized how many diligent and committed staff members we had in our midst, staff who worked with great integrity to forge and deepen relationships with our business partners.
in response to the changing market conditions and evolving consumers needs, the group adopted a transformation strategy and achieved initial success. in the course of solving the crisis, the company successfully raised a total of more than rmb5.3 billion from new strategic investors as well as from the issuance of new shares and convertible bonds, the combination of which provided the company with sufficient working capital and an appropriate capital structure. gome not only strengthened its fundamental capabilities and improved its operating efficiency, but also maintained its leading position in the home appliance retail industry in china, with a 34.45% growth in profit attributable to owners of the parent over the previous year. the company has already weathered the impact of these crises and is now well-positioned to enter a phase of consistent and in response to the change in and demand, the company fully implemented its strategy of transformation, focusing on network rationalization and individual store profitability improvement. the company ensured that large-scale stores were opened in premium locations to accommodate large inflows of customers, while we closed down 189 underperforming stores. as a result of this rationalization, the revenue of the company for the reporting year dropped approximately 7.02% as compared to that of 2008.
at the same time, however, we are pleased to note that the 532 comparable stores recorded same store sales of rmb34,816 million, an increase of 2.81% as compared to rmb33,864 million of last year.
through a series of measures to enhance the profitability of individual stores, including d i f f e r e n t i a t e d p r o d u c t management, and provision of value-added services like extended warranty service and after-sales service, our consolidated gross profit margin increased to 17.32% from 16.94% last year.
in 2009, the group recorded a 12.35% decrease in operating profit from rmb1,944 million in 2008 to rmb1,704 million.
however, the decrease in operating profit narrowed and improved on a quarterly basis thanks to the setting and achievement of precision management targets. profit for the year attributable to owners of the parent amounted to approximately rmb1,409 million, a sharp rise of 34.45% compared to that of last year. the basic earnings per share ( eps ) were rmb0.103, a rise of 25.61% as compared to rmb0.082 last year.
as of 31 december 2009, cash and cash equivalents were rmb6,029 million. this satisfactory cash position and sound capital structure laid a solid foundation for our future development. however, in may 2010, the redemption rights of the 0% coupon convertible bonds due in 2014 (the old 2014 convertible bonds ) will become exercisable. we also need to prepare for potential requirements for capital to develop second tier markets and rural areas and to upgrade our internal information systems. therefore, we recommended the board of directors of the company (the board ) not to pay a final dividend for 2009.
g o m e s h i f t e d i t s f o c u s a n d d e v e l o p m e n t 2009 marked a new stage of realignment in the company s history. previously, during rapid economic growth we focused only on aggressive territorial expansion and our business depended on consignment from vendors. in 2009, gome shifted its internal focus and development toward to be aligned with the trends we obser ved in consumer demand. due to measures taken in accordance with our new growth model, including network rationalization and differentiated product management, major operating indicators such as consolidated gross profit margin, operating profit margin and net profit margin all showed during the previous year, we repositioned our relationships with suppliers and gradually moved from maximizing benefits to ourselves, which had been our mode of operation in the preliminary development stage of the industry, to a model of win-win cooperation, using the integrated service platform and economies of scale of gome to operate jointly for mutual benefit. we appreciate our suppliers for the understanding, trust and support they offered us during the crisis. when the crisis subsided, the cooperation between gome and its suppliers increased to unprecedented high levels.
