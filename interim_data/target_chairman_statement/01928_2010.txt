we operated very effi ciently to control our overall cost 
we maintained an experienced management team with a proven track record in both operations and 
we derived significant benefits from our on-going relationship with las vegas sands corp.
these business strategies resulted in strong financial and operating performance for our group in 2009. the venetian macao welcomed 23.8 million visitors during 2009 and generated us$554.8 million (hk$4,302.3 million) in adjusted ebitdar, an increase of 11.6% compared to the us$497.2 million (hk$3,853.5 million) in 2008. the sands macao welcomed 6.9 million visitors and generated us$243.4 million (hk$1,887.5 million) in adjusted ebitdar in 2009, an increase of 13.5% compared to the us$214.4 million (hk$1,661.7 million) generated in 2008. in its fi rst full calendar year of operation, the four seasons hotel and plaza casino welcomed 4.5 million visitors and generated us$40.3 million (hk$312.5 million) in adjusted ebitdar.
the introduction during the year of our paiza mansions, luxurious accommodations of 3,50017,000 square feet, contributed to a signifi cant increase in adjusted ebitdar at this property in the latter half of the year.

our cost savings and efficiency programs remained an important component of our operating strategy throughout 2009, and i am pleased to report that we were successful in implementing all of our identifi ed cost savings initiatives by december 31, 2009. i believe that these initiatives will allow us to expand our adjusted ebitdar margins in the future and will provide enhanced operating leverage in the months and years ahead.
we hosted 15 trade shows in 2009, which attracted more than 320,000 visitors to macao and cotai. in addition, we hosted 388 corporate groups, which brought an additional 60,000 delegates to macao. given current trade show and group booking trends, we are confi dent of strong growth in mice visitation in 2010.
we substantially completed the construction of our four seasons-branded apart-hotel tower in the fourth quarter of 2009. we feel that market conditions in macao are favorable for the execution of our strategy and expect to begin to monetize this important asset in 2010.
in november 2009, the macao government awarded a concession by lease for parcels 5 and 6. we are now waiting for publication of the land concession in the offi cial gazette.
after receiving commitments of us$1.75 billion of project financing in november 2009 (which we expect to close in april 2010), we were able to mobilize to recommence the construction of parcels 5 and 6 of our cotai strip developments. we also expect to get into high levels of actual construction starting in april. we expect that it will take approximately 16 months to complete construction of phase i, which will include 3,700 rooms from the shangri- la, traders and sheraton hotel brands, and an additional six months to complete the adjacent 2,300 room sheraton tower hotel in phase ii.
the macao government granted us an extension of the development deadline under the land concession for parcel 3 on cotai on september 29, 2009. under the terms of the land concession, we must now complete development of parcel 3 by april 17, 2013.
our cotaijet tm ferry operation was issued a new 10-year license on january 14, 2010. the new license not only permits us to continue operating ferries between macao and hong kong, but also permits us to offer additional routes to macao from hong kong, including from the china ferry terminal in kowloon and the hong kong international airport. opening these new routes and increasing capacity from hong kong to macao will facilitate the growth of our mice business by seamlessly linking hong kong to cotai.
the process of becoming a listed company in hong kong was completed during the year, and provides the opportunity for asian investors to participate in our future success through the ownership of shares in sands china. our business strategy is to continue to successfully execute our cotai strip developments and to leverage our integrated resort business model to create asias premier gaming, leisure and convention destination. our business strategies and development plans allow us to achieve strong growth and fi nancial performance in the future. we look forward to reporting to shareholders at the annual general meeting and in the next interim and annual reports on the effective management of our companys business and assets, and upon the continued delivery of value to you and
