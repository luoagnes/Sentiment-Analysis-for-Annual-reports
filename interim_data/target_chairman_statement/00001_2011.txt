2010 in review hong kong s economy continued to improve solidly in 2010. gdp growth was 6.8% in real terms primarily supported by the strong recovery of private consumption and external trade, while inflationary pressure has begun to accelerate due to rising global commodity and food prices.

the local property market registered an increase in transactions throughout most of 2010 as compared to the previous year, supported by solid demand from flat buyers. in view of the government s various measures introduced to stabilise prices over the past few months, future market developments are expected to be affected not only by demand but also by the government s initiatives targeted at the property sector. nevertheless, given continuing inflation, and the solid support from market demand amid improving labour market conditions and the resultant low unemployment rate, the property market is expected to continue to be healthy, barring unforeseen adverse changes.

the group generated strong turnover from property sales last year. we will continue to strengthen our market presence and revenue base through a steady provision of diversified, high quality properties to meet market demand. meanwhile, we will seize suitable opportunities for quality land acquisitions to replenish our well established land bank and to support further expansion of the property portfolio.

in 2010, the group recorded a satisfactory increase in contributions from property sales and property rental, while the contribution from hotels and serviced suites increased significantly compared to the previous year. the fair value of the group s investment property portfolio has increased as it evolved towards maturity following the growth in the amount of rentals and enhancement in the quality of tenants.

in 2010, the group s property business continued to perform well on the mainland, with good progress in both project development and land bank expansion. the introduction of new tightening measures reflects the central government s policy to promote the healthier growth of the property market, and such measures will be fundamental in guiding the market s future developments.
continuing inflation, the current favourable employment conditions, robust economic growth and strong market demand will continue to underpin the strength of the mainland s property market over the long run.
