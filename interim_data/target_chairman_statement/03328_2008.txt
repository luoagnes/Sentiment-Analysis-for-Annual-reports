return to the a share
as the oldest commercial bank in the history of china, the bank s development has been deeply rooted in mainland china.
it had always been our dream to share the benefits from the bank s rapid development with domestic investors by returning to the a share market at an appropriate time. with this wish in mind, the bank successfully issued 3.19 billion a shares on the shanghai stock exchange and raised about rmb25 billion at the turn of spring and summer in 2007. the bank s a shares were enthusiastically pursued by domestic investors and the frozen fund ranked the highest on record for the a share market, which was an exceptional the successful a share listing set a new milestone in the group s development history following the h share listing in hong kong. the a share listing of the group not only solved the share redesignation issue, but also completed our joint-stock reform. in addition, we have expanded our shareholder base, enabled more domestic shareholders to enjoy the benefit from the bank s rapid development and created favorable conditions to further improve our corporate governance and boost market image. more importantly, with the establishment of a financing platform in the a share market, the group is better positioned to take advantage of the rapid growth of china s economy and grasp golden opportunities for further in the era of disintermediation in the finance industry, a comprehensive operation is critical for all banks. a successful comprehensive operation connects various financial markets and achieves orderly linkage between banking, insurance, funds and securities businesses. extended business scope, cross-sale of financial products as well as reform of our management structure contributed to the expansion of business scale. banks can fulfill the objective to diversify its operational risks through the involvement in various financial markets.

the wise do not always follow the same method as folks say. when creativity is an attribute which only individuals with outstanding performance share, then conforming to the rules can be tolerated.
but when creativity is an essential factor for survival, relying on the status quo is definitely not the way forward. looking at today s financial industry, the long-term rapid development of china s economy has led to the explosive growth of corporate and personal wealth. with the frequent changes in the economic environment, we believe that there will be enormous market demand for professional wealth management services. wealth management will become one of the core businesses of modern financial services, which will eventually lead to changes in business patterns of commercial banks.
based on the above analysis, we have proposed a strategic concept to build the best wealth management bank in china in 2007. our network is mainly concentrated in china s most developed regions and wealthy cities with a great concentration of large and medium-sized companies and medium to high-end individual customers. we have taken advantage of this feature to vigorously promote the reform of our network and centralized the use of our network resources for the delivery of wealth management services to our customers.
we have constantly introduced new wealth management products including oto fortune (l_[), bocom fortune (nt) and win to wealth ( [ ) targeted at medium to high-end individuals and corporate customers.
through the integrated use of various financial instruments, the management of corporate and individual customers assets, liabilities, income and finance were centralized, thereby achieving an integrated, one-stop customers wealth in 2007, we have made great progress in the field of wealth management. the number of medium to high-end wealth management customers exceeded 1 million, the custodian asset from individual customers reached rmb300 billion, of which 75% of the total business has been contributed by medium to high- end customers, representing 5% of total customers. wealth management for corporate customers developed steadily as well. investment banking businesses, such as financial advisory and consulting, have become a new area of profit growth.

as a commercial bank which conducts a risk business, making profit is bound to be an important goal even though it is not the only purpose. we believe that a banking operation also requires the art of management as banks must strike the best balance between risk and profit. therefore, it is important to establish a healthy and compliant management system.
based on this concept, we have continued to focus on the development strategy of priority of management, stability of operation and achieved sustainable maximum return for shareholders and the continuous optimization of our internal management will continue to be the most important task. we have gradually established a risk management system with checks and balances by vertical management and parallel operations, accelerated the development and application of risk management tools, and transformed risk management from relying on experience to the disciplined usage of information, data and modern risk assessment tools. we have cooperated in the building of the process bank and centralized the processing of credit authorization, audit, accounting and documentation in our back office. we have greatly enhanced the degree of professionalism and centralization in our operational management. this led to the improvement in our system processing ability and enhanced controls in operational risks, which contributed to significant cost savings and achieved sustainable value growth.
what is particularly exciting is that we have completed the launch of our internal grading system for our corporate business in 2007, which made us the industry benchmark for the implementation of the new basel capital accord. this further strengthened our controls over credit risks in an environment of tightening macro- control. we are very pleased that our key management projects, including the retail business internal grading system, reform of human resources management and management accounting system, have all made satisfactory progress.

it has always been our goal to enhance our corporate governance and add more value to our shareholders. in order to comply with the requirement of a share listing in 2007, we have comprehensively amended the bank s article of associations, procedures for shareholders general meetings and board of directors meetings, and constituted rigorous authorization policies in relation to the authorization approvals from shareholders general meetings to the board of directors, from the board of directors to the president of the bank, and other relevant authorization management procedures. these procedures have ensured the rules and regulations of our corporate governance strictly comply with domestic and overseas supervisory guidelines and standards. we have frequent communication with world-wide investors through different methods and channels, to share our operational strategies and material progress in reform and development, and to implement changes based on feedback and suggestions from shareholders. this enabled our stakeholders to participate in the bank s operational management in a proper way. we have continued to be an industry leader in the area of information disclosure. in addition to the disclosures to meet external supervisory requirements, we have initiated the timely disclose of other information that may have a practical impact on the strategic decision-making of shareholders and other relevant stakeholders. what deserves a special mention is that the contents of our quarterly reports, which were prepared based on the standards for interim financial statements, were informative and accurate and were well received by the terms of office of the fourth session of the board of directors expired in 2007.
pursuant to the bank s articles of association, the fifth session of the board of directors was elected at the shareholders general meeting. the service period of the fourth session of the board of directors coincided with the critical time when the bank actively promoted the trilogy of reorganization , fund raising and listing and we have achieved a favorable reform on its institutional mechanism. all directors worked earnestly and diligently, demonstrated profound professionalism and outstanding ethics and made great contributions to strengthening our corporate governance and improving operational management. please allow me to hereby express my deep gratitude to all our directors. in the new session of the board of directors, most of the directors from the fourth session have been re-elected, with mr. qian wenhui, mr. gu mingchao, mr. yang fenglin and mr. timothy david dattels joining the board. they are all elite individuals in their fields, who are full of wisdom and professional experience. we believe that the new session of the board of directors can inherit the bank s outstanding values and operational strategies in order to continuously create value for all in 2007, we also welcomed new joiners to our senior management team. ms. yu yali was promoted to vice president and concurrently serves as chief financial officer. mr. yang dongping was employed as the chief risk management officer of the bank. they have both served in the bank for a long time and have had a profound understanding of its history, culture, system, structure, operational management and development strategy.
after their joining the team, our senior management team has become more professional and effective. we believe the team is capable to implement all the decisions of the board of directors more effectively and promote the bank s operational management to a new stage.

we always consider social responsibility to be a crucial factor in establishing an outstanding corporate image. as the organization moved from a mere sense of legal responsibility to striving towards the higher-level moral principles, it allows the business to become more attractive and social responsibility becomes the cornerstone of successful enterprise based on this belief, we became one of the first institutions among the domestic listed companies to establish a social responsibility committee under the board of directors and to issue a corporate social responsibility report . this enabled us to balance the needs in profit- making and benefiting the community during the process of business development. we have identified various opportunities to grant loans to national key development projects, to economic undeveloped areas and to small enterprises in their early development stage as a way to share our economic prosperity. in 2007, we have supported the china disabled persons federation to launch to the future bocom disabled youth scholarship program and is expecting to donate rmb100 million within the next 10 years to support more disabled youth to acquire more techniques. we believe this will not only improve their living conditions, but also contribute to the building of a harmonious cooperation with hsbc the strategic cooperation between bocom and hsbc has reached 3 years by the end of 2007. in the past three years, an efficient and smooth communication and coordination mechanism has been established, which has continuously strengthened our cooperation. according to the technical support and cooperation plan, hsbc has provided valuable support to the bank in the aspects of operating concepts, management tools, products and techniques. this has enabled us to share the excellent brand and experiences of hsbc as a world-class international bank and to improve our operational management skills and market influence.
both parties cooperated in the credit card business, international business and rmb fund business, and created a series of well-known financial service brands. in order to better handle the potential competing interests arising from the cooperation and further integrate both parties resources advantages, we have jointly developed an innovative key customers joint-marketing program and have already successfully led several going forward, we will handle the competing interest arising from the cooperation properly and continue to strengthen our strategic cooperation.
