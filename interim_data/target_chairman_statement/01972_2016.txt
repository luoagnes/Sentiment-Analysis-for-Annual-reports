in hong kong, demand for office space improved in 2015. in 2016, high occupancy and limited supply will put upward pressure on rents in central despite a slowdown in demand for office space by mainland chinese entities. high occupancy is expected to result in rents in taikoo place and cityplaza being reasonably resilient despite increased supply in kowloon east and other districts. in guangzhou, office rents are expected to be stable in 2016 despite a substantial supply of new office space. in beijing, office rents are expected to weaken in 2016 as substantial amounts of new office space become available and demand falls.
