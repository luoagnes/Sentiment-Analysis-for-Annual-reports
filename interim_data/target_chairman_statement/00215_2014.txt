mobile business hong kong and macau mobile business turnover was hk$9,359 million in 2013 compared with hk$12,383 million in 2012. revenue from mobile hardware sales dropped by 39% to hk$4,221 million as a result of lower demand for new handset models during the year. mobile service revenue fell by 6% to hk$5,138 million of which 2% drop was due to the transition from a subsidised handset business model to a non-subsidised handset business model. the transition began in 2010 and was completed in the first half of 2013.
all our postpaid customers under handset bundled contracts as at the end of 2013 were on the non-subsidised handset business model. mobile service revenue decreased by a further 4% as customers migrated to lower-tier service plans. ebitda and ebit in 2013 were hk$1,570 million and hk$961 million respectively, representing a drop of 25% and 35% respectively.
as of 31 december 2013, our total number of customers in hong kong and macau was maintained at approximately 3.8 million (2012: 3.8 million). over 60% of our 3g and 4g lte postpaid customers in hong kong and macau were smart device users.
the financial performance of our mobile business is expected to stabilise and improve in subsequent periods due to the completion of transition to the non-subsidised handset business model in the first half of 2013, which had a dilutive effect on service revenue, and the removal of unlimited local data offering and introduction of additional tier-pricing in late 2013. with the continued competitive landscape in the mobile market in hong kong, the mobile business will focus on strengthening customer loyalty by introducing more customer-oriented services and applications.

the growth momentum of fixed-line business is expected to continue, especially in the corporate and business markets, which were the key growth drivers in 2013. continued effort and focus will be put into new product development and providing better customer experience via speed and service upgrade.

in 2013, the improvement in the performance of our fixed-line business partially offset the fall in the mobile business. we expect that the performance of the mobile business will be improved in 2014, albeit an increase in deferred tax expenses which would affect the overall results is anticipated. as an integrated telecommunications solution provider, we will continue to develop innovative and customer-oriented mobile, fixed-line and integrated services and products for new customers. we will also look for opportunities to provide our existing customers with additional services to meet their total telecommunications needs. our fundamentals, with state-of-the-art network infrastructure and financial strength, will serve us well as we continue our pursuit of service excellence. i have confidence in the prospects of the group.
finally, i would like to take this opportunity to thank the board and all staff members for their dedication, professionalism and determination to succeed.
