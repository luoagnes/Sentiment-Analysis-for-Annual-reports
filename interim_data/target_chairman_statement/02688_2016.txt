chairman s statement
the group will seize every opportunity, leverage on its strengths to adapt to any market changes and meet results of the year in 2015, the global economy slowly recovered amidst the volatile market.
during the year, china continued its structural reform and its annual gross domestic product ( gdp ) growth dropped from 7.4% in 2014 to 6.9%. the weak macro-economic environment dampened energy demand in the industrial sector.
in addition, as the international oil prices continued to hover at low levels, the price of substitute energy also remained under downward pressure. facing these headwinds, the growth of downstream natural gas consumption in china also slowed. according to figures from the national development and reform commission ( ndrc ), national apparent consumption of natural gas in 2015 was only up 5.7% year-on-year.

in such a challenging market environment, the group, upholding its customer- oriented philosophy and driven by reform and innovation, was able to sustain an excellent operational performance. the group further developed the potential of its traditional businesses, while fully utilising the internet and technological means to vigorously expand new businesses. with the concerted effort of its employees, the group continued to maintain remarkable growth. total natural gas sales volume increased by 11.5% to 11,286 million in light of the company s solid profit base, the board has recommended a final dividend of hk$0.76 (equivalent to rmb0.64) per share, payable to shareholders registered in the register of shareholders on 8 june 2016. the total amount of dividend was around rmb690 natural gas pricing reform in recent years, china has accelerated the pace of its reform on the marketisation of natural gas pricing. on 1 april 2015, to comply with the three-step reform plan formulated in 2013, the ndrc reduced the city-gate price of incremental volume by rmb0.44 per cubic metre and increased the city-gate price of existing volume by rmb0.04 per cubic metre. as a result of such measures, the city-gate prices of existing volume and incremental volume had converged. on 18 november 2015, the ndrc issued a notice that the maximum city-gate price for non-residential users was reduced by rmb0.7 per cubic metre, effective from 20 november 2015. moreover, according to the latest notice, city-gate price would no longer be the ceiling price but it would become a benchmark price, meaning that it could be subject to negotiation between suppliers and buyers, and any upward adjustment not exceeding 20% or floorless downward adjustment could be made. such move by the ndrc further relaxed price control and offered flexibility in pricing, leaving more room for price negotiation between suppliers and buyers.
in addition to restoring the price advantages of natural gas over substitute energy such as gasoline, diesel and lpg, these two price cuts lowered the average gas procurement cost for the group s gas projects. as of the end of 2015, part of the city-gas projects and cng refuelling stations affected had finished downstream tariff adjustment.
the group passed through the reduced cost to end-users in order to reduce their energy consumption costs. a lower gas price stimulated downstream demand and facilitated development of new clients, which had a positive impact on the group s gas sales growth. the company will continue the pass-through process and take into account various factors including different customers affordability and the price of substitute energy to adjust the selling price for end-users with a flexible pricing strategy, so as to maintain a balanced development between gas sales volume growth and stable dollar margin.

the natural gas pricing reform in november 2015 also expressively required the acceleration of trading of gas for non-residential usage through shanghai petroleum and natural gas exchange ( shpgx ). it aimed at creating a fully open and transparent market for non- residential gas trading within two to three years, where the exact transaction price would be determined by the suppliers and buyers through open transactions.
the shpgx was put into trial operation on 1 july 2015, an important step taken by the ndrc towards an in-depth reform of natural gas trading and pricing. the shpgx not only help accelerate the setting of a fair market price for natural gas and create suitable condition for the liberalisation of it, it can also strengthen our global influence when the domestic natural gas market practice is in line with that of the international market. the shpgx heralds a new page in china s natural gas reform and will pose significant positive impact on the industry development. as one of the shareholders, the group actively participated in the trading of piped gas and lng on the shpgx during the year, and acquired competitive gas sources at market prices to develop new customers.
