over the past 10 years, bmw brilliance has achieved remarkable performance by riding on the dynamic growth of the chinese economy, and has successfully built up bmw as one of the most desirable premium auto brands in china while establishing a world-class production base in shenyang. the joint venture has continued to refine its business model and product strategy to cater to the needs of the chinese consumers, leveraging on the strong support and amicable cooperation of its shareholders. however, bmw brilliance is not complacent with its achievements so far. in preparation for further competition in the premium segment, the joint venture is currently implementing various operational measures and changes, while the shareholders are reviewing potential future opportunities for further growth of bmw brilliance, all in an effort to attain long-term sustainability and to properly position the joint venture to meet future market changes and challenges.
as for the minibus business, the new premium mpv model co-developed with our strategic partners and external consultants is targeted for market launch at the end of 2014. therefore, the year 2014 will remain challenging for this business, and it is likely that the minibus operation will pose a negative financial impact to the group s overall performance for the year. in addition to the new model being developed, we are concurrently studying various options to augment our minibus portfolio over time.
apart from the above, the group continues to look for ways to further streamline our operation and to strengthen our corporate structure as our operations continue to grow. the group is also on the lookout for new business opportunities as a means to further expand our income base.
last but not least, i would like to express my sincere appreciation to our shareholders, business partners, management team and employees for their continued support and dedication to the wu xiao an (also known as ng siu on) 27th march, 2014
