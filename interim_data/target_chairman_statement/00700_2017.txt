business review and outlook
1. company strategic highlights in 2016, we strengthened our connection strategy by making our social platforms more interactive for users to share and communicate, and by connecting our social platforms to a broader range of online and offline services. we increasingly sought to differentiate user experience between our qq and weixin platforms.
qq increasingly catered to a younger user base by enriching and optimising its entertainment-oriented functionalities. from a social perspective, qq introduced a series of features to make chatting and sharing experience more entertaining, such as facial beautifying tools, painting-styled photos, and animated video stickers.
from a content perspective, qq stimulated user activities with entertainment-oriented content such as literature, cartoons, and short videos.
weixin focused on providing more convenience to users daily life. during the year, weixin enriched its content ecosystem around official accounts and boosted merchant and user adoption for weixin pay. in january 2017, weixin launched mini program that we believe over time should help us broaden and deepen our service offering in low-frequency use cases, connect more offline services to online users, and provide more venues for users to sample functionalities offered by apps and thus increase the conversion rate for app downloads.
we also sought to deepen connection between our users and our core business engines: online games: our online games business delivered another year of solid growth. through data mining, we improved performance of our existing titles and gained deeper insights into player behaviours. in china, several of our self-created games such as honour of kings, legend of yulong mobile and naruto mobile achieved significant success, and we reinforced our position as the preferred china publisher for local and overseas game developers.
