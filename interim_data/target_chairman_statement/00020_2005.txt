during 2004, following the progressive extension of the individual traveller scheme (its) in the second half of 2003, the local retail market made a swift rebound that boosted both retail rentals and capital values. meanwhile, rentals for office space also soared on the back of strong demand as a result of acceleration of business activities brought by the cepa effect and china s continued vibrant economic development. in addition, the labour market continued to show signs of improvement with the unemployment rate gradually declining. all in all, the hong kong economy experienced a solid, broad-based upturn. last year, hong kong s gdp increased by 8.1 per cent, the highest year- on-year growth since 2002.
