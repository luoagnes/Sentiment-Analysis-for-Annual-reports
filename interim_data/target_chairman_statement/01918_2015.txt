concentrating on existing regions while prudently replenishing with quality land in 2014, it became a consensus to most of the industry players to determine that the real estate market was on a trend of differentiation since a large amount of capital was being poured into tier 1 and 2 core cities to compete for new lands, which kept the land prices in these cities at a high level and contributed to a rising land price. under such a circumstance, the company is actively seeking various opportunities while always maintaining caution. leveraging on its dominance in these cities and the multitude of experience accumulated over the years of development, the company has acquired 12 pieces of quality land at reasonable prices, incorporating 3.49 million square meters of land into our reserve. grasping existing regional opportunities actively and cautiously, the company also keeps looking for new regions and new cities with potential, in order to get prepared well for future expansion into new cities.
outlook for 2015 in 2015, the prc economy is still encountering a lot of difficulties. however, given the increasing governmental efforts in reform and the gradual implementation of reform measures, the company is full of confidence in the prc economy in the long run. although the economic growth slackened, the quality of which will be enhanced continuously. such is more important to the long-term healthy development of the real estate industry. in 2015, the company is of the view that the operating environment of the real estate industry will improve significantly, relative to 2014, especially in terms of macro- control policy and financing environment. however, it does not support the view of a bigger magnitude of growth in 2015.
the company believes that the whole market will keep stable, and that differentiation in different regions with imbalanced demand and supply will still continue, so will the industry consolidation and elimination of players. the medium and large developers with good regional layout, good products and brands will enjoy more distinct advantages, and their market shares will continue to grow.
