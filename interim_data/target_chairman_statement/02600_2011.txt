chairman s statement i hereby present the annual report of the group for the financial year ended december 31, 2010 for shareholders review. on behalf of the board of the company and all employees, i would like to express my sincere gratitude to all shareholders for their concern and support for the company.
product market reviews the supply and demand as well as the price of aluminum are closely tied to changes in the global and the prc macro-economies. changes in the global and prc economic climate have a significant impact on the aluminum market.
primary aluminum market under the influence of economic stimulus packages worldwide, the global economy and the demand for aluminum gradually recovered in the year 2010, the supply of aluminum increased accordingly and the annual demand and supply of aluminum basically attained equilibrium. however, beset by the european debt crisis, china s control policies such as those over the real estate sector and energy saving and emission reduction as well as the tight electricity supply in europe, global aluminum prices remained range-bound with sharp fluctuations. in mid-april, china s control policies over the real estate sector and the european debt crisis had driven the global aluminum price to plummet. both prices of three- month aluminum futures at the london metal exchange (hereafter as lme ) and shanghai futures exchange of the prc (hereafter as shfe ) hit year-low at usd1,844 per tonne and rmb14,580 per tonne, respectively. in november, after the introduction of quantitative easing monetary policy by the u.s. government, bulk commodity prices moved steadily upwards due to factors such as excessive liquidity, depreciation of the u.s. dollar and reduction of aluminum production as a result of china s energy saving and emission reduction policies. prices of three-month aluminum futures at both lme and shfe surged to year-high reaching usd2,477 per tonne and rmb18,470 per tonne, respectively. the average three-month aluminum futures prices for 2010 at lme and shfe were usd2,272 per tonne and rmb16,186 per tonne, representing a year-on-year increase of 34.5% and 20.3%, respectively.
in 2010, the global output of primary aluminum was approximately 41.90 million tonnes, representing a year-on-year increase of 11.2%; the global consumption of primary aluminum was approximately 41 million tonnes, representing a year-on-year increase of 19.6%; the domestic output of primary aluminum was approximately 15.65 million tonnes, representing a year-on-year increase of 20.5% and the domestic consumption of primary aluminum was approximately 16.50 million tonnes, representing a year-on-year increase of 19.5%. as of the end of 2010, the production utilization rate of primary aluminum manufacturers in the world (inclusive of those of the prc) was 75.5%, while that of the prc in 2010, international and domestic prices of spot alumina fluctuated upward. at the beginning of the year, alumina price rose as alumina supply decreased due to the resumption of production of aluminum manufacturers and the reduction of production of alumina manufacturers. following the drop of aluminum price in the middle of the year, international and domestic prices of spot alumina fell to as low as usd300 per tonne and rmb2,400 per tonne, respectively. since late july, alumina price gradually rebounded as a result of the launch of newly-constructed aluminum production capacity and the rise of aluminum price; the fob price of spot alumina in the international market rose to as high as usd390 per tonne. at present, the fob price of spot alumina in the international market is approximately usd385 per tonne and the price of spot alumina price in the domestic market is approximately rmb2,850 per the global output of alumina for 2010 was approximately 82.01 million tonnes, representing a year- on-year increase of 12.9% and the consumption was approximately 82.86 million tonnes, representing a year-on-year increase of 14.5%. the domestic output of alumina was approximately 28.94 million tonnes, representing a year-on-year increase of 21.4%; the demand for alumina was approximately 31.50 million tonnes, representing a year-on-year increase of 19.2%; imported alumina amounted to approximately 4.31 million tonnes in 2010, representing a year-on-year decrease of 16.1%. with the resumption of primary aluminum production, alumina manufacturers around the world have gradually increased their production utilization rate since the third quarter. as of the end of december 2010, the production utilization rate of alumina manufacturers in the world (inclusive of those of the prc) was 85.0%, while that of the prc was 82.2%.

in 2010, the volatility of aluminum price posed grave challenges to the group s production and operation. focusing on its controlling loss and increasing profit principle and centered around structural adjustment as well as strategic transformation and based on the principle of centralized management and delegated operations , the group adopted effective scientific counter-measures to further enhance its fundamental management, costs and expenses as well as investment controls and reduction of energy consumption, thus safeguarding and stabilizing production and operation of the group, thereby turning losses into profits. at the same time, the group has expanded its business scope to other resources to include coal and iron ore.
