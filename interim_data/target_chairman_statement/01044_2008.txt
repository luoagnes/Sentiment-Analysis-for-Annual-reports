despite the continuous growth in the personal hygiene product market in mainland china, competition is very intense and raw material costs remained high.
many small and medium manufacturers experienced operation difficulties and some were even out of market. however, the group continued to expand the production scale to achieve better economies of scale and increased internal production efficiency by improving the production process and reducing the wastage of raw materials, thus successfully mitigating the impact of buoyant raw material prices.
looking forward, the personal hygiene product market still has plenty of room and potential to grow under the favourable condition of steady growing economy and better living standard in mainland china. as such, the group will capture business opportunities by expanding distribution and sales network, strengthening market promotion, enhancing product portfolio, developing more advanced technology to upgrade products and striving to increase production capacity.
