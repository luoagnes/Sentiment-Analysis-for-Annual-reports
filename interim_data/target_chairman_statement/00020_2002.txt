hong kong is best positioned in asia, having successfully dealt with the three major challenges, namely, the sovereignty change since 1982, the asian financial crisis in 1997 and the hollowing out phenomenon since 1979.
the worst is behind us.
hong kong is exceptionally strong in the service industry which now contributes 86 per cent of hong kong s gdp. yet, this sector accounts for only 33 per cent of gdp in china. we see that being a great opportunity as hong kong is the service platform and service provider to help rebuild china s much needed service industry.
china s wto membership is a new milestone for hong kong, presenting unprecedented positive opportunities and challenges. hong kong s critical mass in logistics, corporate and financial services, market place for goods and commercial services is unparalleled. hong kong is the haven for private enterprise. we believe hong kong is in the right place, at the right time and with the right neighbour. over the last 50 years, hong kong has been preparing for the opening of the china market. it is now opening.
with the strong recurrent dividend income stream coming from wharf and new asia realty, wheelock is well-placed to participate in the recovery of the hong kong economy.
