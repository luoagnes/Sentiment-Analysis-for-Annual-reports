in april 2011, the group acquired two parcels of land adjoining the existing brickell citicentre site in miami, u.s.a., for hk$215 million. development entitlements have been approved by the city of miami for a special area plan, which allows for a mixed-use development of approximately 2.9 million square feet (excluding car park and circulation areas), comprising retail, office, hotel and serviced apartments, and residential components over two phases also in april 2011, the group completed the acquisition of a property at 23 tong chong street (near to the existing taikoo place properties), which will be redeveloped into serviced in august 2011, the group sold its entire interest in the property in hong kong known as festival walk for hk$18.8 billion. a net gain of hk$595 million on this sale was included in the attributable profit for 2011. the underlying profit on the sale, which is calculated by reference to the original cost of the property, was hk$8,615 million.
in september 2011, the retail space at taikoo hui, a 3.8 million square foot mixed-use development in the tianhe district of guangzhou, opened. handover of the office space to tenants commenced in august 2011. the hotel and serviced apartments are scheduled to open in the second half of 2012. the group has a 97% economic interest in this development.
in october 2011, the contemporisation project for the mall at pacific place was substantially completed. the project began in 2007 and includes the addition of a fourth hotel (the upper house), new luxury restaurants, new interior decoration, designer shop facades and a general reconfiguration of the mall.
in december 2011, the office tower of the indigo development, a retail-led, mixed-use project in jiang tai in the chaoyang district of beijing, opened. the retail component started to open in march 2012. the group has a 50% economic interest in this development, which has a total area of 1.9 million square feet.
also in december 2011, following a tender, the group acquired two adjacent residential sites in cheung sha on lantau island in hong kong. the sites will be developed into luxury residential properties for sale.

in january 2012, the group secured planning approval to expand three pacific place in hong kong by redeveloping two nearby buildings. the expansion will provide an additional floor area of about 100,000 square feet. it is subject to obtaining lease modification and other government the company is setting up a representative office in singapore in order to explore investment opportunities in south east asia.

adjusted underlying profit increased in 2011 from hk$3,833 million to hk$4,372 million.
adjusted underlying profit excludes profits from the disposal of investment properties and net impairment losses from our hotels and trading properties. the increase principally reflects positive rental reversions and stronger turnover rents in hong kong, improved rental performance at sanlitun village, and the opening of the taikoo hui development, resulting in an increase of 9% in gross rental income. the operating performance of the owned and managed hotels in hong kong was much improved. the positive effect of these favourable factors was offset in part by the loss of rental income following the disposal of festival walk and a move from profits to losses from the property trading portfolio as a result of lower trading volume and sales and marketing costs incurred in connection with the residential developments in gross rental income was hk$8,557 million in 2011 compared to hk$7,875 million in 2010.
positive rental reversions were recorded in the hong kong office portfolio, reflecting strong demand in the first half of the year. rental reversions remained positive in the second half of the year, notwithstanding a slowdown in leasing activity. retail sales and the demand for retail space in hong kong continued to be robust throughout 2011.
in mainland china, net rental contributions from sanlitun village, particularly village south, improved significantly from 2010, as a result of active management of the tenant portfolio, cost reduction initiatives and capital expenditures designed to enhance footfall and circulation.
rental contributions from village north also increased due to higher occupancy and cost reduction initiatives. the taikoo hui development, which was completed during 2011, began to contribute rental income in the fourth quarter of 2011.
we made an operating loss on property trading. this reflected fewer sales (derived from the remaining residential units at island lodge in hong kong and asia in miami) and sales and marketing costs incurred in connection with residential developments in hong kong. sixty of the 126 units at azura were pre-sold in 2011, bringing the total number of pre-sold units to 98 at 31st december 2011.
the operating loss in the hotel portfolio reflects impairment charges at our u.k. hotels and pre- opening expenses at the hotel in taikoo hui, partially offset by improved performances from the two hong kong hotels, the upper house and east, hong kong, and the opposite house in beijing, as these hotels continued to benefit from buoyant economic conditions. the non- managed hotels also performed strongly.

administrative expenses were hk$118 million above those of 2010 due to higher expenses associated with the listing of the shares of the company on the stock exchange of hong kong limited.
net finance charges were hk$1,477 million, a 19% increase from hk$1,237 million in 2010.
the increase reflected an increase in the fair value of a put option held by the owner of the non- controlling interest at sanlitun village, higher finance charges in mainland china (due to higher debt levels and a reduction, following the completion of projects, in the amount of interest capitalised) partially offset by lower average debt levels in hong kong following the disposal of on an attributable basis, the net investment property valuation gain, before deferred tax relating to investment properties in mainland china in 2011, was hk$21,066 million, compared to a net gain in 2010 of hk$22,373 million.

net debt at 31st december 2011 was hk$27,700 million, compared with hk$36,836 million at 31st december 2010. the decrease principally reflects the repayment of inter-group funding from swire pacific out of the proceeds from the disposal of festival walk and cash from operations, partially offset by higher debt levels in mainland china. gearing decreased by 7.6 percentage points from 23.3% to 15.7%. cash and undrawn committed facilities totalled hk$9,183 million as at 31st december 2011, compared with hk$7,435 million at 31st december 2010. upon maturity of the inter-group funding provided by swire pacific, swire properties will obtain new funding (as necessary) on a stand-alone basis without recourse to swire pacific.

the company recognises the importance of acting responsibly towards its stakeholders, including employees and the communities in which we are involved and towards the natural environment in which we operate. in september 2011, we established a joint research centre for building energy efficiency and sustainability with the building energy research centre of tsinghua university, offering us$1 million per year in funding for an initial three years.
further information about the company s activities in this area is on pages 82 to 85.

demand for our office space in hong kong is likely to be affected by uncertain market conditions. low vacancy rates and the fact that supply of new office space will be modest should mitigate the effect on rental income. the available office space will increase in 2012 with the completion of the 145,390 square foot building at 28 hennessy road and the 81,346 square foot building at 8 queen s road east, expected to take place in the second half of the year. we plan to start redeveloping one of our techno-centres, somerset house, in 2013 upon obtaining vacant possession, with a view to taking advantage of the demand for high specification office buildings in that area.
consumer demand and accordingly competition for retail space are expected to remain strong in hong kong in 2012. active monitoring of the preferences of consumers and management of the mix of tenants should encourage higher retail sales in our malls.
retail conditions in mainland china are expected to remain strong in 2012 as the economy continues to rebalance and grow. results from sanlitun village are expected to continue to improve in 2012, reflecting past and planned investments aimed at enhancing footfall and circulation. taikoo hui and indigo are expected to contribute to higher rental income in 2012, with taikoo hui in its first full year of operations and the retail component at indigo starting to open in march 2012.
property trading is expected to contribute significant profits in 2012, with the completion of and sale of units in the azura development in hong kong. prices of luxury residential properties in hong kong are expected to be steady, underpinned by low interest rates and limited supply.
the hotels in hong kong and mainland china are expected to continue to perform well in 2012, benefitting from increased business and leisure travel as the economies of mainland china and the rest of asia continue to grow. the 263-room hotel (operated by mandarin oriental) at the taikoo hui development is scheduled to open in the second half of 2012. east, beijing, which is part of the indigo development, is also scheduled to open in the latter part of 2012.
2012 marks the 40th anniversary of our incorporation. the company is proud of its past achievements and we will use these strong foundations to develop our business further. despite uncertainties in the global economy, the fundamentals of the hong kong and mainland china economies are expected to remain strong. we are well placed to benefit from this.
on behalf of the shareholders and fellow directors, i wish to express our appreciation to all our employees, whose commitment and hard work have been central to our continuing success.
