chairman s statement i hereby present the annual report of the group for the financial year ended december 31, 2012 for shareholders review. on behalf of the board of the company and all employees, i would like to express my sincere gratitude to all shareholders for their concern and support for the company.
product market reviews the supply and demand as well as the price of aluminum are closely tied to changes in the global and the prc macro-economies. changes in the global and prc economy have a significant impact on the primary aluminum market in 2012, the world economy lacked momentum in recovery, the chinese economic growth slowed down. under the influence of multiple factors such as recovery expectation on main economies and changes of the euro debt crisis, global aluminum prices remained at low levels throughout the year.
from the beginning of the year to early march, affected by the temporary subsidence of the euro debt crisis and the positive trend of the us economy, international aluminum prices rebounded. the price of three-month aluminum futures of lme hit year-high of usd2,349 per tonne in early march; subsequently, affected by news such as chinese s downward adjustment to economic expectation and re-deterioration of euro debt, international aluminum prices recorded a downward trend, falling to a year-low of usd1,830 per tonne in august. afterward aluminum prices rebounded primarily due to the expectation of easing policy adopted by main economies. in the fourth quarter the price of aluminum at lme dropped again due to another decline of the global economy. domestic aluminum prices, impacted by continual increase in supply and slowdown of the growth in consumption, continued to flutuate at low level. as underpinned by the cost factor, the fluctuation of domestic aluminum prices was lower than those of aluminum prices at lme. in the beginning of the year, driven by external aluminum prices, the price of three-month aluminum at shfe rebounded to a year-high of rmb17,000 per tonne and as affected by domestic and international bearish news as well as pressure on the fundamentals, stopped rising and dropped to a year-low of rmb14,950 per tonne but slightly rebounded afterwards.
in 2012, the year-high price of three-month aluminum futures at lme was usd2,360 per tonne, the average three-month aluminum futures prices for 2012 at lme and shfe were usd2,051 per tonne and rmb15,795 per tonne, representing a year-on-year decrease of 14.90% and 6.50%, respectively.
in 2012, the global output of primary aluminum was approximately 47.06 million tonnes, representing a year-on-year increase of 3.20%; the global consumption of primary aluminum was approximately 46.61 million tonnes, representing a year-on-year increase of 3.3%; the domestic output of primary aluminum was approximately 21.30 million tonnes, representing a year-on-year increase of 9.51% and the domestic consumption of primary aluminum was approximately 21.45 million tonnes, representing a year-on- year increase of 10.00%. as of the end of december in 2012, the capacity utilization rate of primary aluminum enterprises in the world (inclusive of the prc) was 84%, while that of the prc was 78%.

owing to the fact that international electrolyse aluminum prices hovered over low level for a long period of time, certain alumina enterprises reduced or suspended production and there was a significant increase of oversupply pressure in alumina market in 2012. spot prices in australia fluctuated between the range of usd300 and usd330. impacted by the change in indonesia s bauxite export policy, domestic alumina prices in the second quarter rose with fluctuation, up to rmb2,710 per tonne. nevertheless since later second quarter, electrolyse aluminum prices continued to drop and new alumina production capacity commenced operation, oversupply and aluminum price pressure resulted in a continual drop in alumina prices. in early september, domestic spot market declined to around rmb2,570 per tonne, and slightly picked up after mid-september amid the effect of the rebound in aluminum prices and stocking for the mid-autumn festival and national day. in 2012, the year-high and year-low international price of spot alumina was usd333 per tonne and usd303 per tonne respectively, with an average price of usd319 per tonne, representing a year-on-year decrease of 22.76%; whereas the year-high and year- low of domestic price of spot alumina was rmb2,750 per tonne and rmb2,480 per tonne respectively, with an average of rmb2,648 per tonne, representing a year-on-year decrease of 4.95%.
the global output of alumina for 2012 was approximately 93.53 million tonnes, representing a year- on-year increase of 3.15% and the consumption was approximately 91.96 million tonnes, representing a year-on-year increase of 2.86%. the domestic output of alumina was approximately 41.65 million tonnes, representing a year-on-year increase of 7.32%; the demand for alumina was approximately 40.20 million tonnes, representing a year-on-year increase of 2.97%; imported alumina in china amounted to approximately 5.02 million tonnes in 2012, representing a year-on-year increase of 167.02%. as of the end of december 2012, the alumina capacity utilization rate of alumina enterprises in the world (inclusive of the prc) was 85%, while that of the prc was 73%.
aluminum fabrication market in china, the building, transportation and power industries accounted for approximately two-thirds of the aluminum consumption. the slowdown in china economic growth and the macro control policies on real estate resulted in a slowdown of growth of aluminum consumption in china in 2012.

in 2012, in face of an acute and complicated operational environment with a surplus in production capacity, slumping prices, declining ore quality and restrictions to the supply of imported bauxite, the group endeavored to a series of measures, such as vigorously promoted structural adjustment and strategic transformation, reduced costs and increased efficiency. the group ensured smooth running of production and operation, strengthened the capability of controlling cost, continuously increased the reserve of resources and energies, guaranteed the safety and stability of capital and improved 1. the company assisted production of some leading products while suppressing some others, and increased production output in regions with cost competitiveness. in 2012, the output of self- owned bauxite mines amounted to 17.26 million tonnes, representing a year-on-year increase of 27.29%, the output of alumina amounted to 11.90 million tonnes, representing a year-on- year increase of 8.08%; the output of alumina chemicals amounted to 1.31 million tonnes, representing a year-on-year increase of 10.08%; the output of primary aluminum products amounted to 4.22 million tonnes, representing a year-on-year increase of 7.93%; and the output of aluminum fabrication products amounted to 0.539 million tonnes, representing a year-on-year decrease of 13.06%.
