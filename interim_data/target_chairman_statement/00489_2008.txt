while we have made a general advancement in all respects, the board of directors recognises that there are still challenges and diffi culties ahead. the annual sales volume of dongfeng peugeot citron automobiles company ltd. and dongfeng nissan passenger vehicle company have failed to meet the expected targets, and the growth rate of sales of commercial vehicles, particularly heavy trucks, has been lower than that of the industry. looking ahead, we believe that 2008 will still be a unprecedented booming year for the prc automobile industry. with the encouraging growth prospect, the annual sales volume of vehicles in the industry is expected to be above 10,000,000 units. we also realise that, however, the economy of china will see macro-control pressures in 2008.
the sales price of vehicles will be lowered due to intensifi ed market competition and it will be more diffi cult to control the cost because of higher prices of raw materials. the dongfeng motor group will endeavour to address and settle all these issues in a proactive way.
