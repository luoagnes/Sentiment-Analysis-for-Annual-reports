the hong kong economic environment remained strong, supported by robust domestic demand and strong fi nancial markets. th e prc economy, particularly the pearl river delta ( prd ) region, continued to enjoy strong growth. th e macau economy was active in the aggressive expansion in its entertainment and gaming industry. globally, major industrialized nations have recorded steady positive growth.

in hong kong, the group s rental property business has recorded satisfactory growth. th e average occupancy rate of hopewell centre, the flagship of the group s properties, maintained an optimal level of about 94%. following the completion of the major renovation and ongoing enhancement works, hopewell centre is attracting more renowned corporations as tenants and the rental rates for both renewals and new lettings have increased substantially.

pre-letting of emax has started and market response is encouraging. th e star hall, a new multi-purpose hall, is planned to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2007. bookings have commenced and strong market response was received with the fi rst show scheduled already.
the qre plaza in wanchai was topped out in december 2006 and it is currently planned to be completed in the third quarter of 2007.

in macau, for our nova city project (of which the group has a 50% interest), almost all the residential units of phase i and ii have been sold and construction of phase iii is well under way. the pre-sale of three blocks (out of four) of phase iii units was launched during the year with about 98% of them sold so far. in june 2007, the group entered into a conditional agreement with a group company of one of the project joint venture partners to dispose of its 50% interest in the project as well as its interests in two related property management companies for a total consideration of hk$4,580 million in cash. the disposal, when completed, will enable the group to capture the opportunity to early realize the value of its interests in the project and to secure a gain on disposal.
in the prc, all the apartments and townhouses of phase 1a of our hopewell new town project in huadu, guangzhou were completed and sold out. the development of phase 1b is currently planned to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2008.
b e i n g a s o c i a l l y r e s p o n s i b l e a n d environmentally friendly company, we have formed a special team to study and implement a variety of green initiatives in our properties, including power saving and recycling. these initiatives will not only help to protect our environment, but will also help to control th e group s infrastructure business continued to achieve steady growth. during the year, to manage the increasing traffi c demand, we have spent much eff orts and resources on improving the traffic management of the expressways in operation. resources have also been deployed to enhance the safety facilities, strengthen the patrol and rescue services aiming to improve emergency handling efficiency and minimize traffic congestion caused by traffic accidents.
as a result, the number of fatal in accidents had been substantially reduced. the joint venture agreement for phase ii of the western delta route ( phase ii west ) was approved by the relevant authorities with equity injection for the joint venture commenced during the year, and the construction of the expressway is proceeding. preparation for phase iii of the western delta route ( phase iii west ) is under way and construction work will commence after obtaining approval from the relevant authorities. as reported in the media, feasibility studies on the hong kong-zhuhai-macau bridge project have been substantially completed and the central government is highly supportive of the project. hopewell highway infrastructure limited ( hhi ), the group s listed subsidiary, is confident that it will be in an advantageous position to assume an important role in this project once it proceeds to the tendering stage.
on 9th august, 2007, a wholly-owned subsidiary of hhi entered into an agreement with one of the joint venture partners of the guangzhou east-south-west ring road joint venture for the sale of its entire interest, including rights, duties and obligations in the guangzhou east-south-west ring road joint venture, for a consideration of rmb1,712.55 million.

for the new power plant project in heyuan city, guangdong province, project approval of the 2 x 600 mw ultra super-critical coal-fired power plant project has been obtained and construction work of the project is in progress.
