the year 2002 remained a difficult one for the hong kong banking industry. the pressure on margins did not subside, and profitability was adversely affected by sluggish loan demand, falling interest rates and the sharp rise in the number of personal bankruptcies. the outlook for 2003 remains challenging, despite an expected turn-around in the domestic economy. competition among banks will continue to be keen, as they strive to maintain and expand their market positions. banks will continue to look for new ways to use their capital effectively, and will be aggressive in exploring new revenue and profit streams. in view of the continuing difficult operating environment, there is likely to be further consolidation within the sector, as commercial pressures will benefit those with greater size and economies of scale.
bea has maintained its strategic position as one of the most respected financial institutions in hong kong.
in the face of the challenges, bea will continue to pursue its proven strategy to enhance its franchise and strengthen its competitive position in the market. bea strives to exploit new market opportunities and develop alternate income sources. it continues to seek potential acquisition and alliance opportunities as part of its growth strategy. in january 2002, bea acquired a majority shareholding in tengis limited, a major provider of corporate services. bea has subsequently brought tengis and other related acquisitions together under tricor holdings limited, building the largest provider of business, corporate and investor services, including share registration, corporate secretarial, trust and outsourced administration services, in hong kong. this business offers excellent cross-selling opportunities to the group, and will be a significant fee income contributor to bea in the coming years. in february 2002, bea kicked off its new corporate identity initiative, with a dynamic brand image and new branch layouts tailored to the group's strategy. to realise greater value from its extensive local branch network, bea has repositioned itself as a comprehensive one-stop financial services centre and undertaken a broad programme to promote the sale of insurance, wealth management and other products at its branches.
improving operating efficiencies has been a key focus in the group's operations. bea has undertaken a number of initiatives to achieve this objective. bea successfully completed the merger with first pacific bank in april 2002, enhancing its efficiency and economies of scale. rationalisation of the branch network has progressed as scheduled, and the number of branches was reduced to 105 by the end of 2002. bea is also shifting certain back office operations in the areas of data entry, call centre services, computer programming and bills and credit card support to its lower-cost guangzhou operation centre, which commenced operation in october 2002.
the china market forms an important element of bea's growth strategy. the bank has aggressively leveraged its well established presence in china to further enhance its position as a premier foreign bank.
with an extensive branch and office network, bea is well prepared to capitalise on the opportunities arising from the liberalisation of the banking industry following china's accession to the world trade organization. bea will also explore strategic alliance opportunities in china to enhance its business development and opportunities.
with our unique position in the china market, the synergy of our corporate services and insurance businesses with our main banking business, the aggressive promotion of our brand identity and our strong customer base, we will continue to build for the future and enhance our franchise in hong kong, the mainland and
