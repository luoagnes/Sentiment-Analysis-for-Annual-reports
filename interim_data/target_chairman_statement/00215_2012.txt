turnover from our fixed-line business in 2011 was hk$3,403 million, a 4% increase as compared to 2010, with continued service revenue growth in our carrier business offset by a decline in the service revenue from our residential market segment due to intense price competition in particular in the voice sector. ebitda and operating profit of hk$1,016 million and hk$364 million for 2011 are 5% and 14% lower than those in 2010 respectively mainly due to above-mentioned intense price competition in the residential market and a non-recurring hk$44 million write-off of submarine cables located at the hong kong-zhuhai-macau despite 2011 being a challenging year, the business continued to grow. our carrier business, including provision of services to other mobile network operators in hong kong, continued to expand its coverage as those mobile network operators expanded their network capacity. in another development, our international and idd businesses continued to grow as we expand our overseas coverage and interconnections with operators worldwide via our comprehensive network. our corporate business, which provides customers with a fully integrated offering including virtual private network services, continued to grow in line with our enlarged market share and customer base and increased offerings from the deployment of cutting-edge technologies.
the residential market segment, with a relatively small revenue share in our fixed-line business, experienced intense price competition in 2011. we expect this segment to remain very competitive. nevertheless, our business is well-positioned to capture future opportunities leveraging our extensive fibre infrastructure. our latest 3home broadband service offering provides customers with broadband speeds up to 1gbps, coupled with attractive and exclusive value-added services at a very competitive price highlights our determination to broaden our presence in this market.

the outlook for our mobile business is very encouraging as the market sees a greater smartphone penetration and growth in data usage, which translate to revenue growth and business opportunities. in response to growing number of smartphone users and accelerating data usage, we have undertaken various initiatives to cope with increasing network capacity and coverage demand as well as to provide our customers with innovative and attractive product offerings. we have made good progress on re-farming the 900mhz band spectrum for 3g services, which is expected to be completed in 2012. this, coupled with the launch of the long term evolution service when more related mobile devices become available in the market, will undoubtedly enrich our portfolio and provide further business growth opportunities. our alliance with vodafone will open up more business opportunities in the corporate market, and also benefit our customers with an expanded international roaming offering.
our fixed-line business will benefit from increasing data usage from our carrier, corporate and residential customers and increasing demand for new data centric services like mobile backhaul network and cloud computing services. we have been appointed by hong kong exchanges and clearing limited, as one of the only three accredited vendors to provide securities and derivatives network (sdnet2) service, which will allow us to serve the needs of a greater number of corporate customers.
we are in a strategically-advantageous position to capitalise on the data era. our unique strength, which lies in our fixed-mobile integrated capabilities, along with best-in-class mobile networks supported by an extensive fibre infrastructure will enable us to provide a greater range of competitively priced and attractive service offerings to our customers and for us to grow our finally, i would like to take this opportunity to thank the board and all staff members for their dedication, professionalism and determination to succeed.
