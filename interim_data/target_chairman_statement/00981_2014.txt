letter to shareholders
we are pleased to announce that in 2013 smic continued to achieve profitability on a full-year basis. we attained around us$170 million in net profit, an increase of more than six times compared to the previous year. we continue soundly and steadily on the path of sustainable profitability. according to ihs isuppli s data, in 2013 the global semiconductor annual growth rate was only 5% and the pure-play foundry growth rate was 12%, while smic s growth was 21.6% (if excluding revenue from wuhan xinxin, the annual growth rate reached 27%). in 2013, the company realized record-high annual sales of us$2.07 billion, while exceeding the average industry growth for the second year in a row.
since the fourth quarter of 2012, our 4045nm process began mass production, and revenue contribution from our 4045nm process has climbed from 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2012 to 16.3% in the fourth quarter of 2013. customer demand for our mature-process differentiated products remained strong, especially in camera chips, power management chips and smart cards; our revenue from these three technologies increased about 50 percent compared to 2012.
in terms of advanced process research and development, we had completed 28nm process development as planned, in the fourth quarter of 2013. smic s first 28nm multi-project wafer, which included both hkmg and polysion, launched in late 2013 for customer chip qualification. as mainland china s first 28nm process technology foundry, smic has once again proven its strength and capability to continuously provide technology support for the world s top ic designers. we will be increasingly vigorous in strengthening our technological innovation to meet the growing customer demand for advanced technologies and differentiated products.
smic continues to benefit from the rapid growth of china s semiconductor design companies. after a 34% growth in 2012, in 2013 revenue from our mainland china customers continued to show strong growth of 45%. contribution from china rose to 40.4% of our total annual revenue in 2013 from 33.9% in 2012.
in addition, during the year of 2013, the company continued to actively undertake acts of social responsibility and invest numerous resources for various kinds of green energy projects, recycling, community service, and others in order to build a harmonious society and make a positive contribution. it is worth mentioning that in april 2013 smic launched the smic liver transplant program for children to fund liver transplants for impoverished children at jiao tong university school of medicine s affiliate of renji hospital in shanghai. as of the end of 2013, more than 18 children received donation funding to complete their operations. in the future, smic will continue for the long-term to support the smic liver transplant program for children , to help and give more children a chance at life and restore joy to their families.
we are delighted with smic s achievements in 2013, and at the same time, we are also aware of the impact of short-term inventory adjustments faced by some customers in the second half of 2013; thus, we take a cautious approach to meet the challenges in 2014. looking into 2014, we will continue to strengthen the development of our advanced technology and differentiated processes and strengthen partnerships with customers, to achieve long-term sustainable profitability. keeping in mind the best interests of our shareholders, we diligently and carefully execute our business plan.

we would like to again express our sincere gratitude to all of our shareholders, customers, suppliers, and employees for their continued attention and support to the development of smic.
