cheung kong property holdings limited (the group ) was listed on the main board of the hong kong stock exchange on 3 june 2015 by way of introduction. the listing marked a new phase of growth for the group under its reorganised business structure.
the group s principal activities now encompass property development and investment, hotel and serviced suite operation and property and project management, and it has interests in three listed real estate investment trusts. it has a portfolio of diversified properties, which includes properties located in hong kong, the mainland, singapore and the united kingdom. with the inclusion of a large number of high-quality properties from the cheung kong group* and the hutchison group**, the group s quality property portfolio has expanded significantly and become more diversified both in terms of asset type and geographical locations. our fundamentals and competitiveness have been strengthened in terms of our business scale, operating base, and overall capabilities to sustain growth.

this is the first annual report of the group since its incorporation and listing, which covers (i) the results of the property businesses of the cheung kong group for the full year and (ii) the results of the property businesses of the hutchison group after the property businesses combination*** for the period from 3 june 2015 to 31 december 2015. during the reporting period, all the principal businesses of the group continued to perform solidly, and an increase in the fair value of investment properties was recorded reflecting the group s long held policy of conservative property valuation.
for the year ended 31 december 2015, the group s audited profit attributable to shareholders was hk$17,113 million, comparable to the profit of the property businesses reported by the cheung kong group for the previous year, while profit before investment property revaluation was hk$15,568 million, 29% higher than that reported last year, and investment property revaluation increment was lower than last year.

the group s high quality property development portfolio has expanded in terms of scale and market coverage as the properties developed by each of the cheung kong group and the hutchison group have been transferred to the group, and the joint ventures between the two groups have become its subsidiaries. the property market conditions remained challenging in hong kong and on the mainland during last year. all development and marketing plans have proceeded cautiously according to their scheduled timetables. revenue and contribution from property sales were in line with expectations.

the group s investment property portfolio has extended notably due to the addition of various commercial properties of the hutchison group such as cheung kong center, hutchison house, and china building which have been sources of quality rental income. with an aggregate gross floor area of approximately 1.5 million sq.m., the portfolio provides the group with steady cash flow and stable recurring income to complement the cyclical revenue streams from the development and sales of properties. retail sales in hong kong have weakened, exerting increased downward pressure on retail rents as a whole. the group s property investment operation remained resilient amid a more difficult environment as compared to the past few years. a solid increase in contribution was recorded in 2015, partly attributed to the increase of investment properties which generated new streams of rental contribution to the group, and the benefits of a loyal, quality tenant base and well-balanced tenant mix which helped stabilise rental income.
hotel and serviced suite operation with the inclusion of a number of large-scale, premium hotels and serviced suites of the hutchison group, the group s hotel and serviced suite portfolio has visibly enlarged to cover over 16,000 rooms in aggregate and has brought with it stronger synergies. the hotel industry environment is increasingly challenging as tourist demand declines in the light of uncertain global economic prospects. against this backdrop, the group s hotel and serviced suite operation was inevitably affected.
property and project management the group continues to strengthen its property and project management business to support its development and investment properties. the inclusion of those projects managed by the hutchison group has increased the total floor area of properties under the group s property management.

with proactive government measures to stabilise economic growth and to improve and adjust its macroeconomic policies, the long-term economic outlook of the mainland is expected to remain stable and positive, albeit with some fluctuations expected in the process. as stated in our interim report, the one belt, one road initiative, which is a long-term development strategy of the mainland, will present tremendous opportunities to various business sectors and hong kong as a whole, thereby facilitating its economic development in the longer term.
the hong kong residential property market continued to consolidate during the period as a result of property-related policies. on the mainland, buyer s sentiment and property activities are expected to improve following the central government s measures to de-stock housing inventory. going forward, the level of property prices in hong kong and the mainland will continue to be affected by the increases in construction costs as well as development and marketing expenses. government housing policies will continue to be a major factor in determining the long-term direction of market
