in 2016, the overall property market in china stayed at a high level. in the first half of the year, with the loose fiscal policies in the banking sector and the introduction of reform of the housing system by the central government, rigid demand and upgrader demand in housing were encouraged. the favourable policies lured tremendous demand from people who have rigid needs, upgraders and speculators, resulting in a substantial rise in the transaction volumes in the property market with a constant upsurge in sales prices. since the third quarter of the year, in order to alleviate the pressure of surging commodity housing prices, various restrictions on property purchase and mortgage loans have been once again implemented in certain popular first- and second-tier cities, leading to a slight downward trend in the transaction volumes of the commodity housing while the prices remained at a high level. meanwhile, destocking pressure remained high in most of the third- and fourth-tier cities, which intensified city differentiation. throughout 2016, the overall property market in china showed increases in both the transaction volumes and prices with a record high in 
during the year of 2016, the group (together with its joint ventures and associates) outperformed approximately 51.8% of the annual sales target of rmb15.5 billion with the contracted sales amount over rmb20 billion and achieved recordhigh contracted sales amount reaching approximately rmb23.524 billion and contracted sales area of approximately 1.66 million sq.m. for the year, representing an increase of approximately 62.1% and 33.1% over last year, respectively. in terms of cash collection, the group has also achieved satisfactory results with the cash collection rate of property sales for the year reaching 93.0%.
during the year, the group (together with its joint ventures and associates) had more than 50 projects on sales in 13 cities, among which 11 projects were newly launched for sale, namely polaris and sunshine mansion in beijing, sce plaza phase 2 and the royal bay in shanghai, sunshine city phase 2 in shenzhen, marina bay and city twilight in tianjin, the royal green in hangzhou, uptown in nanchang and sce plaza and sunshine park phase 2 in quanzhou. in terms of contracted sales amount in 2016, the contribution from the first- and second-tier cities accounted for approximately 65.8%. this marked the success of the groups strategy of focusing on first-tier cities and quality second-tier cities.
apart from the sales boom in the first- and second-tier cities, the transaction volumes in the third- and fourth-tier cities also rose progressively driven by popular cities, with a significant expansion in the increase in prices. during the year, the group recorded good sales performance in quanzhou, zhangzhou and yanjiao. the contracted sales amounts of these three cities accounted for approximately 29.6% of the contracted sales amount of the group (together with its joint ventures and associates).
land bank strategy
the vigorous land markets were driven by the prosperous momentum of the real estate market, leading to the frequent emergence of prime land. the group adhered to the principle of prudent land expansion, and never demonstrates reckless aggression. under the intense competition in the bidding of land, the land development department of the group strengthened its close co-operation with the sales and marketing department and the design department of the group, putting emphasis on innovation, and the enhancement of product positioning and the ability of exploring value so as to be prepared for land bidding. on the other hand, the group is proactively seeking opportunities for land acquisition to increase its land bank with a more reasonable cost. in 2016, the group acquired nine projects in the first-tier cities and quality second-tier cities located in beijing, shanghai, tianjin, nanjing, hangzhou and suzhou, respectively, through bidding and acquisition, with an above-ground buildable area of approximately 1.68 million sq.m., at a land consideration of approximately rmb11.6 billion. the average land cost was approximately rmb7,166 per sq.m. among which, the land acquired through acquisition had an above-ground buildable area of approximately 1.14 million sq.m., with huge potential for earnings growth.

we are always in awe of the market. our top priority is to pay close attention to market changes, and design and sell suitable products according to the market demand. currently, chinas urbanisation process is still underway. a large amount of young population flocks to first- and second-tier cities to seek jobs. all these factors determine that rigid demand in housing will inevitably last for a much longer period. as a result, regarding the design of rigid demand projects, we provided more units with two rooms of gfa ranging from 60-70 sq.m. and units with three rooms of gfa ranging from 89-100 sq.m. these small units are relatively low in price with more suitable design, which can satisfy the rigid demand of the said young aged group and are welcomed by the market. with the improvement of peoples living standards as well as the introduction of policies such as the two-child policy, upgrader demand is also increasingly prominent, which gradually transformed into another sense of rigid demand. regarding such a trend, the company designed and launched units such as villas with smaller area and larger three-room units to accommodate the demand 
in addition, we are well prepared in grasping the opportunity in unit launch. in the second half of 2016, restrictions on property purchase and mortgage loans were implemented again in certain popular cities. we proactively respond to the market changes by identifying the direction of the demand and selling products, such as soho apartments, with no restriction on purchase and mortgage loan in an orderly manner so as to boost up our sales. proactive adjustment and flexible sales strategies devoted outstanding contribution towards the companys achievement of a higher level of contracted sales results throughout the year.

sound and healthy financial system lays the foundation for the continuous operation of the real estate developers. during the year, the group proactively launched new projects in first- and second-tier cities and increased its efforts in destocking in third- and fourth-tier cities. with a more favourable cash collection, the group had a strong cash flow base.
regarding financing, the group proactively makes use of the financing platform while strictly controls its gearing ratio. in the beginning of 2016, the company obtained financing by way of a term loan in the principal amount of us$400 million with a term of three years and six months at an annual interest rate of libor plus 4.2%. the company applied the said capital for the redemption of the senior notes at a coupon rate of 11.5% due 2017 to optimise its debt structure. in 2016, the weighted average financing costs of the group decreased from approximately 9.1% last year to approximately 6.8%. meanwhile, in order to mitigate the foreign exchange risks resulting from the expected depreciation of renminbi, the group has entered into certain capped forward cross currency swap contracts for the indebtedness of us$750 million.

since the third quarter of 2016, with the split of levels of the real estate market, the central government implemented policies according to cities. on one hand, it implemented the policy of restrictions on property purchase and mortgage loans in popular cities. on the other hand, it implemented policies encouraging destocking of the third- and fourth-tier cities with a high level of stocks. at the central economic work conference in december 2016, the central government discussed the development orientation of the industry, monetary and credit policies, and destocking regarding the real estate market, with a clear emphasis on the residential nature of housing, in support of reasonable demand for credit lines, as well as the enhancement of the effective supply of land. a series of measures initiated by the central government aims to restrain the unreasonable housing demand and further cool down the overheated real estate market in popular cities, so as to resume a rational real estate market.
under the guidance of the policies implemented by the central government and local governments, the group anticipates that the magnitude of the increase in transaction volumes of the real estate market in popular cities may be narrowed in 2017, while the transaction prices are likely to remain at a high level. third- and fourth-tier cities will be benefited from the encouraging policies and spillover effects of the popular cities, for which the pressure on integration is expected to be relieved. in the long run, the group is still full of confidence in the prospects of the real estate market as our country is gradually promoting the new-type urbanisation development and the construction of the long-term mechanism of the real estate market.
from the strategic point of view, the group is still in favour of the development of the real estate market in the first- and second-tier cities. we will adhere to the strategy of focusing on first-tier cities and quality second-tier cities by exploring the development opportunities in these cities on an on-going basis. the group is going to enter into two to three core cities each year in order to enhance the reputation of the company in first-tier cities and quality second-tier cities. meanwhile, the group will continue to cooperate with other real estate developers to develop synergies and diversify investment risks.
apart from engaging in property development, the group also proactively participated in primary land development project for the purpose of storage of land parcels for industrial parks, and treated it as a strategic business. going forward to 2017, the group will accelerate the development pace of its primary land development project located in quanzhou.
the project occupies a site area of approximately 3.11 million sq.m., which is intended to be planned to be a livable coastal eco-town with industrial parks. the group has successfully developed and acquired an area of approximately 670,000 sq.m. for the land parcel of the industrial parks. the group believes that the project will become another profitable growth point for the group.
in 2017, the group will continue to promote the development progress of the projects steadily, so as to provide the group with sufficient area available for sale. in 2017, the group and its joint ventures expect to launch 11 projects for pre-sales. most of them are located in first- and second-tier cities, including the paramount and jade plaza in beijing, sky horizon, the glamour and the paramount in shanghai, royal palace and garden terrace in tianjin, international finance
centre phase 2, gold coast phase 3, nanan world city and sce mall (shishi) phase 2 in quanzhou.
2017 marks the milestone of the groups development. this year, the group has relocated its headquarters to shanghai for its business operations in response to the in-depth arrangement of the yangtze river delta strategic approach. the company will continue to strengthen the control model of its headquarters and constantly deepen the organisational management reform so as to achieve significant breakthroughs in terms of strategies, processes and the establishment of human resources, while further optimise the operational management. the group believes that with shanghai as the base, the group will achieve a greater leap in its development of the group by gathering the advantages of the resources and talents in the first-tier city, focusing on fine operations and intensive regional development. the coming year is bound to be a year full of opportunities and challenges. the group looks forward to working with all our employees together under the new environment so as to achieve outstanding results! 
last but not least, on behalf of the board, i would like to express our sincere appreciation to all staff of the company, our shareholders, clients and business partners! wong chiu yeung
