to our shareholders, many a time, the key to success depends on the interplay between decision-making and timing. it has long been the hope of mankind that any decisions can generate or bring forth positive outcome. in their co-published theory of games and economic behaviour in 1944, mathematician john von neumann and economist oskar morgenstern proposed an interactive model based on mathematical theories to study how a rational person makes his most rational decision under intricate interactive behaviours. this analysis laid a foundation upon which game theory, a key tool for modern-day economic analysis, is based.
life is, indeed, a game of choices. by intuition, experience or even emotion, people make their decisions, deriving success from correct choices and negative experience from ill-thought ideas. whilst scientific calculation provides the best choice which is considered more appropriate, wideranging elements determine the behaviours of human decisions. instead of employing common assessment standards to distinguish good decisions from bad ones and right decisions from wrong ones, sometimes it is merely a matter of discussions from different viewpoints and perspectives. even for the same issue, the same entity may make bad choices for the first time and reach completely different decisions for the second time, with the application of experience, correction of methods, or even emergence of opportunities coming into play.
for decision-making in operating a modern-day enterprise, it is always contemplated in a leader s mind as to how to lead the team to step forward and bring them from their original points to a new horizon, making improvements and achievements together. apart from detailed planning and adequate preparation, in order to achieve such a goal, the key is whether a leader possesses the commitment and boldness in making forward-looking decisions, and the decisiveness and flexibility in promptly correcting himself when facing hindrances and obstructions.
