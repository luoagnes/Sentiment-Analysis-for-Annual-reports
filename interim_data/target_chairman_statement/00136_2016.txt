the information services business can only have foreign ownership of up to 50% and the foreign investor must meet the qualification requirement.
as the wfoe s current foreign shareholders do not meet the qualification requirement, irrespective of which category the wfoe s business is treated to be under, there are still substantial legal impediments for the wfoe in directly applying for the relevant e-commerce operation licenses and permits.
as a result, the restricted business of the group is carried out by shenzhen hengten networks company limited ( opco , m3wr0}a} gplqs) under the structured contracts with shenzhen hengten networks services company limited ( wfoe , m3wr0}a} gr gplqs), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company. the structured contracts are detailed below under the paragraph headed the structured contracts .
the company agrees that it would unwind the structured contracts as soon as the relevant laws and regulations allow foreign investors to own the entire equity interest of the opco.
we have been advised by our prc legal counsel that the structured contracts do not contravene the prc laws, rules and regulations, including those applicable to the business of the wfoe and the opco.
the opco is 55% owned by ms. deng miaojing ( ms. deng ) and 45% owned by ms. yu siyu ( ms. yu , together with ms. deng, the opco shareholders ).
for the group, the community o2o business product are currently in the forms of the hengten mimi app and the online e-commerce platform-hengten mimi home. as disclosed in the sub-section headed business overview under the section headed chairman s statement in this report, the group started developing its o2o business at the end of 2015. the restricted business of the group needs to be operated by the opco in order to obtain registered user and traffic growth, thus acquiring core user base and platform for commencing the group s business. looking forward to the near future, the group expects to grow the o2o business and accordingly, it is expected that the o2o business will become one of the principal businesses of the group in the future. as the restricted business is a material component of the group s o2o business, the performance of which is expected to become material to the overall performance of the group in the future.

as the structured contracts were entered into after 31 december 2015, no revenue or assets are subject to the structured contracts for the year ended 31 december 2015.

as advised by our prc legal counsel, appropriate provisions have been incorporated in the structured contracts to protect wfoe s interests in the event of death, bankruptcy or divorce of the opco shareholders of its equity interest in opco to avoid any practical difficulties in enforcing the structured contracts. the structured contracts encompass certain provisions setting out that the respective contracts shall be legally binding on the legal assignees or successors of the parties thereto.
we have also implemented measures to protect against the potential conflicts of interest between the group and the opco shareholders. pursuant to the business management agreement, the opco and opco shareholders agreed to strictly implement relevant proposals from wfoe from time to time in relation to opco s recruitment and dismissal of employee, day-to-day business management, financial management, etc. under the call option agreement, the opco shareholders granted wfoe an unconditional, irrevocable and exclusive call option to purchase all or any part of the equity interests in opco as and when permitted by applicable prc laws, rules and regulations. furthermore, under the powers of attorney executed by the opco shareholders, directors of wfoe and their successors were irrevocably appointed as the attorney of the opco shareholders to exercise the shareholders rights in opco on behalf of the opco shareholders. as a result, we have minimised the opco shareholders influence on the business operations of opco.
the entering into of the structured contracts did not constitute any notifiable transaction required to be disclosed under chapter 14 of the listing rules, nor any connected transaction of the company under chapter 14a of the listing rules as, to the best of the directors knowledge, information and belief having made all reasonable enquiries, the opco shareholders and the opco were not connected persons of the company.
the risks associated with the structured contracts and the actions taken by the company to mitigate the risks (where applicable) business risks and financial risks borne by the group as the primary beneficiary of opco as the primary beneficiary of opco, the group is exposed to the business risks and financial risks faced by opco.
any profit or loss of the opco will be reflected in the consolidated financial results of the group.
the opco is now in the process of applying for the relevant e-commerce operation licenses and permits. if the opco fails to obtain the requisite licenses and approvals to operate the restricted business in the prc, the group s o2o business may be adversely affected.
the prc government may determine that the structured contracts do not comply with applicable prc laws, rules and regulations as advised by our prc legal counsel, the structured contracts do not contravene the prc laws, rules and regulations applicable to the business of the wfoe and opco, do not contravene the articles of association of the wfoe and opco respectively, and would not be deemed as concealing illegal intentions with a lawful form and void under the prc contract law. the structured contracts are valid and enforceable against the parties to the structured contracts. our prc legal counsel also confirms that all necessary actions or steps have been taken to enable it to reach its legal conclusions.
despite there is currently no indication that the structured contracts will be interfered or objected by any prc regulatory authorities, our prc legal counsel has advised that there is a possibility that the relevant prc regulatory authorities may have different opinions on the interpretation of the relevant prc laws, rules and regulations and would not agree that the structured contracts can be performed under the applicable prc laws, rules and regulations that may be adopted in the future, and the authorities may deny the validity, effectiveness and enforceability of the structured contracts.
possible impact of the draft prc foreign investment law (the draft law ) and its explanation published by the ministry of commerce of the prc on 19 january 2015 on the structured contracts and the business of the opco on 19 january 2015, the ministry of commerce of the prc published the draft law. as advised by our prc legal counsel, the draft law introduced the concept of actual control when determining whether a prc domestic enterprise is in fact a foreign-invested enterprise instead of its place of incorporation. control includes shareholding, decision making or other powers of controlling policy making, or absolutely influencing the operations, finances, human resources and technical aspects of a company through contracts or trusts. as such, there is a risk that the structured contracts will be subject to a change in legal position. according to the definition under the draft law, if the actual controller under the structured contracts is a foreign investor, the domestic enterprise will also be viewed as a foreign investor or a foreign enterprise, and its operations will be in breach of the law prior to obtaining the relevant permission.
nevertheless, our prc legal counsel advised that as there are uncertainties on the final content and interpretations of the draft law if and when it is adopted and becomes law, there is no assurance whether the structured contracts and the business of the opco will be materially affected or not in the future. in addition, our prc legal counsel also believes that due to the long legislative process of the prc, the draft law is unlikely to come into effect in the near future.
if the draft law is to be interpreted in the most stringent way and the authorities deny the validity, effectiveness and enforceability of the structured contracts, the group would lose control of opco, be unable to consolidate the financial results of opco, or properly safeguard, award or control the assets of opco, which would result in a material adverse effect on the group s business, financial condition and results of operations.
in order to continuously monitor the development of the draft law to assess the possible impact on the structured contracts and the business of the opco, the board will monitor the updates of the draft law and discuss with the company s prc legal counsel on a regular basis. in case there would be material impact on the group or the business of the opco, the company will timely publish announcements in relation to material developments of and arising from the draft law.
the structured contracts may not be as effective in providing control over and entitlement to the economic interests in opco as direct ownership the structured contracts may not be as effective in providing the wfoe with control over and entitlement to the economic interests in opco as direct ownership. if wfoe had direct ownership of opco, wfoe would be able to directly exercise its rights as a holder of equity interest to effect changes in the board of directors of however, under the structured contracts, wfoe can only rely on opco and opco shareholders performance of their contractual obligations to exercise effective control. the opco shareholders may not act in the best interests of the wfoe or may not perform their obligations under the structured contracts. such risks exist and the group expects them to continue to exist throughout the period in which the group intends to operate its business through the structured contracts with opco.
in addition, the group has not purchased any insurance to cover risks relating to the enforcement of the structured contracts due to unavailability of such insurance product in the market at the moment based on the best knowledge of the group. therefore, the structured contracts may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing the group with control over opco.
the exercise of the call option under the call option agreement is subject to applicable laws and regulations of the prc. there is no assurance that the call option to purchase the entire equity interests in opco held by the opco shareholders under the call option agreement will be permitted in the future, or whether such acquisition will incur any costs and expenses to the group in addition to the consideration stipulated under the call option agreement. for instance, if the consideration for the transfer of equity interest in opco to wfoe required by the prc laws, rules and regulations is substantially high and the opco shareholders fail to return the consideration to the wfoe or if the competent tax authority require the wfoe to pay enterprise income tax for such returned ownership transfer income with reference to the market value instead of the consideration as stipulated under the call option agreement, in which case the wfoe may be subject to a substantial amount of tax, the financial conditions of the wfoe may be materially and adversely affected.
potential conflicts of interest among the wfoe, opco and the opco shareholders may exist opco and opco shareholders may fail to take certain actions required for the group s business or to follow wfoe s instructions despite their contractual obligations to do so. if they fail to perform their obligations under their respective structured contracts with the wfoe, the wfoe may have to rely on legal remedies under the prc laws, including seeking specific performance or injunctive relief, which may not be effective.
pursuant to the exclusive management consultancy service agreement, business management agreement, call option agreement and equity pledge agreement (the corporate contracts ), any disputes arising from these agreements between the parties thereto should first be resolved through negotiation, failing which by arbitration at the south china international economic and trade arbitration commission (also known as the shenzhen court of international arbitration) ( scietac ) in accordance with the arbitration rules thereof (the arbitration clause ).
the arbitral tribunal may award remedies over the shares or land assets of opco, injunctive relief (such as stipulating certain conducts of business or compelling transfer of assets) or order the winding up of opco. any disputes between the parties to the powers of attorney and the undertakings may be referred to arbitration under the arbitration clause if the arbitral tribunal andor the prc court consider that those disputes fall under the scope of the arbitration clause under the structured contracts.

if any of the parties refers any dispute (not including a request for interim remedies and any other measures in support of the arbitration) arising out of the structured contracts to the court of hong kong and the dispute falls within the scope of the arbitration clause, the court will, if a party so requests not later than when submitting his first statement on the substance of the dispute, refer the parties to arbitration unless it finds the arbitration clause null, void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.
