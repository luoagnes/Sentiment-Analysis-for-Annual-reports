the development of 500 hennessy road, the future northern gateway of our community in causeway bay, is in good progress. we believe this building will remain competitive for a long time to come. environmental sustainability, in particular, has been a key focus of our design and directors and staff i would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere thanks to pauline wong, who retired from the company during the year, having served the board since 1991. i would also like to thank all our staff members for their dedication and hard work during the year.

the global economic outlook will remain negative in 2009, and hong kong s real economy is to be further impacted. hysan will inevitably be affected by the overall environment. however, the longer-term contractual nature of our core leasing business, and our balanced tenant base with no undue dependence on any particular business sector, mean that we should be more resilient during these challenging times.
