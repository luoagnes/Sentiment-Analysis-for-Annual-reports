in 2005, the operating environment in hong kong improved, and loan demand increased in tandem with the strong growth of the local economy. however, economic growth moderated in the final quarter, as the spike in interest rates in the last half of the year dampened consumer sentiment toward property investment and consumption. despite the weakness at the end of the year, the overall asset quality of the banks portfolio improved and the bank was able to make significant progress in recovery of bad debt.
the outlook for 2006 is favourable, although global and local economies are likely to expand at a more moderate pace than in 2005. loan demand and business opportunities are expected to remain buoyant as a result of strong business sentiment and the relocation of some economic activity, particularly in the textiles and clothing sector, from the mainland back to hong kong. to improve income growth, banks will continue to diversify into fee-generating businesses such as wealth management and structured products. furthermore, banks will continue to invest in improving their risk management infrastructure in order to meet the regulatory requirements of the new basel capital accord.
in 2005, bea maintained its strategic focus on growth and efficiency enhancement, and continued to develop new revenue streams. the bank launched a number of distinctive products in both hong kong and china to meet market needs. the bank will continue to actively develop its wealth management business, including private banking and structured products.
furthermore, bea will continue to exploit cross-selling opportunities by promoting tricor s leading corporate services and share registration service and blue cross insurance products.
last, but not least, the bank will also continue to look for roe accretive expansion opportunities via acquisitions and strategic alliances in hong kong, the mainland and elsewhere.
with further expansion of its extensive branch network in the mainland, the bank will continue to enhance its strong franchise in china through capturing business opportunities arising from the introduction of cepa and china s accession to the world trade organization ( wto ). one area that offers great potential is personal renminbi ( rmb ) business in hong kong.
