in recent years, the coal industry of china has developed towards the market-oriented, scale-building and sustainable development, which provide significant opportunities for china shenhua. in 2007, the coal consumption in china continued to be strong, and the supply and demand of coal was basically balanced.
the coal price throughout 2007 increased rapidly.
looking into the year ahead, we expect the china economy to continue its growth in a rapid pace.
continuous development of the key coal consuming industries (including power, steel, construction materials and chemical industries) will raise the demand for coal. generally, in 2008, we expect that the momentum in the coal market of china in 2007 will be maintained, with the supply and demand for coal basically balanced and sales volume and price fluctuating at high levels.
from an international perspective, we expect that the world economy will continue to maintain its growth momentum and the global coal demand will continue to be strong in 2008. in 2008, we expect that the supply will be insufficient to meet the demand. coal supply will be tight in certain seasons and period, spot price will maintain its high momentum with fluctuation, and contract price will increase compared with that of 2007.
in the long run, with a coal price market mechanism established in china, we expect that coal price will stand at a reasonable value reflecting the scarcity of coal. furthermore, high energy prices (as represented by petroleum) in recent years indicate that the global markets has entered an age of high energy prices.
large increase of price in petroleum and gas provides room for increase of coal price. the development of coal liquefaction and coal chemical industry has led to a re-examination of the value of coal resources.
in recent years, the coal industry has been in a transition period from industrial consolidation towards capital consolidation. the government has been determined to enhance coal consolidation by encouraging large-scale coal producers to acquire small ones. as for china shenhua, the reform presents more opportunities than challenges. as a leader in the industry, in addition to accelerating self-improvement and expansion of production capacity, china shenhua will use proceeds raised in the initial public offering of a shares to acquire strategic assets and consolidate resources in accordance with industrial policies. in addition, the company will seek to seize more market share and improve competitiveness through mergers in the coming years, the company seeks to strengthen its foothold in china and positively implement its go global strategy. the company will, by international merger, acquisition and joint equity venture, obtain reserves of scarce resources and develop its international business with the objective of consolidating and raising the company s leading position in the international coal industry. through the diversification of operating regions, the company will strengthen its core competitiveness and achieve sustainable development of the company, fully realising the synergies between overseas and domestic markets and spreading operational risks.
in the coming year, china shenhua will continue to develop its coal, railway, port and power businesses, implement its merger and acquisition strategy and gradually attain its ultimate goal to strengthen, expand and achieve spectacular splendid achievement . the company will actively perform its social responsibility, pay attention to production safety and environmental protection, and promote economic growth to achieve harmonious co-development of human and nature as well as corporate and society. at the same time, the company will strictly adhere to the standard of domestic and international capital markets, voluntarily accept supervision by regulatory authorities, and further enhance corporate governance to bring higher returns for its shareholders.
