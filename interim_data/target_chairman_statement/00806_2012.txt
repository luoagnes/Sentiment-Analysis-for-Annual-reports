chairman s statement cheah cheng hye chairman and co-chief investment offic despite the troubles facing the financial services industry, value partners group remains a steady ship. the business is profitable, our funds continues to pile on the performance awards and the group is on track in building up its brand, resources and market position, as reflected in a strongly positive inflow of subscriptions in 2011.
profit attributable to equity holders of the company did fall sharply in 2011, down to hk$167.3 million (basic earnings per share: hk9.5 cents) compared with hk$653.2 million the previous year. the fall was caused by a big decline in performance fees earned from our core fund management business, and also by mark-to-market losses recorded for our proprietary investments, a large part of which is invested side-by-side with clients in value partners funds.
the setback we see is the result of the collapse in global stockmarkets in the second half of 2011.
we are pleased to propose a dividend for 2011 of hk5.8 cents per share.

markets don t rise every year, of course, so 2011 is an example of a bad year where value partners was put through a stress test. that we stayed profitable in 2011, and could still pay a bonus to employees and a dividend to shareholders, while avoiding lay-offs, showed a fundamental underlying strength. with a reputation for consistently high-quality asset management, a long performance record going back to the firm s founding in 1993, and a well developed infrastructure of support services, the group is able to attract and hold a huge base of assets under management, which provides steady revenues even during difficult periods, in the form of a relatively small but reliable management-fee income.
during the good years, in addition to the management-fee income, we can expect huge contributions from performance fees and mark-to-market gains from proprietary investments, giving value partners a powerful profit potential, which is why value partners stock is sometimes described as a high-beta play on the outlook for asia-pacific stockmarkets, particularly those related to china. as a strong believer in the china story, our view is that the good years will outnumber the bad ones, providing value partners with a strong future. the key is to avoid losses during bad years, and indeed value partners has turned a profit every year since 1993, with the one exception of 1999 when an insignificant loss of hk$261,000 was recorded in the aftermath of the asian financial crisis. furthermore, going forward, the outlook for enlarging the asset base is excellent, as the asia-pacific region s savings and demographic profile is conducive for the rapid expansion of the region s asset-management industry.
the difficulties of 2011 can be illustrated by the performance of our flagship value partners classic fund, which recorded a fall of 17.2% (net) during the year 1 . for reference, the morningstar greater china equity fund category on average fell by 22.2% in 2011 2 .
as a value-investor, we tend to focus on longer term performance, and this remained excellent. since inception 19 years ago, value partners classic fund has made a profit in 14 of the 19 years, with a return averaging a net 16.9% per annum 1 compounded as of 31 december 2011. for reference, the hang seng and msci china indices recorded annualized returns of 7.1% and minus 1.5%, respectively.
in 2012, the prospects for china-related investing are improved. since late last year, beijing has become less concerned about fighting inflation and more concerned about encouraging economic growth, so we expect to see various government measures to boost the economy and the stockmarket. those forecasting a hard landing for the chinese economy face being wrong again, and our outlook is for 7.5% to 8.5% economic growth in 2012, an acceptable slowdown from 2011 s estimated 9.2%. on the chinese mainland, about 100 million individuals own stocks, with some having invested their life savings, and the government faces pressure from these investors to stabilize the stockmarket, which has been a poor performer for the past two years.
