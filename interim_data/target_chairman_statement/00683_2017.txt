meeting challenges to deliver growth the group achieved significant growth in 2016, recording the highest property sales in its history. our portfolio of investment properties also generated its highest rental income to date. this set of outstanding results is attributable to our relentless efforts in building up our prime property portfolio, with a balanced strategy in sales and leasing.
we believe this strategy will position the group well for sustained growth.
a subdued global recovery, slowing trade, and ongoing realignments in the mainland have continued to weigh on the world economy. as a result, the general economic climate will be weaker than expected last year. despite these headwinds for development, the group will proactively face the challenges and seize every opportunity to capitalize on our development and rental properties.
property market demand remains resilient
chinas ongoing economic growth is projected to follow a l-shaped path, as the country is headed for a slow recovery after experiencing a period of contraction. progress has been made in the countrys economic development and its structural reform.
the growth momentum in the mainlands domestic market remains strong, supported by various energizing alternatives. the real estate sector, as one of the economic pillars and growth engines of the chinese economy, is still showing solid fundamentals. however, the property market has shown signs of easing after restrictive measures on property purchases were reimposed in october 2016.
hong kong also introduced a new round of restrictive measures in november 2016 to address the overheated residential property market, including the raising of the stamp duties. the measures have had a mild cooling effect on property purchases, while the market continues to be driven by solid demand. overall, the housing market 
parallel development and stable progress
the group will continue with active property sales in the coming year. in hong kong, the sales of mantin heights and the bloomsway are underway. sales momentum in the mainland also remains robust with the continuing launches in nanjing, nanchang, shenyang and hangzhou. we expect to achieve solid sale performances in these two markets.

the coming year will witness the full commissioning of hangzhou kerry centre. our management team will exert its best efforts to improve the projects tenant mix and to enhance its overall management, aiming to generate a higher rental income from this property.
pursuing sound investment opportunities
we will continue to explore opportunities to acquire land with a focus on first-tier cities. the group has acquired two sites in qianhai, shenzhen, over the last two years. we would expect a very desirable synergistic effect from their joint development. the projects are advantageously situated in a core seafront location in the qianhai special zone, where we plan to build an innovative mixed-use development incorporating our premier green concepts.
the low-density premium residential project at beacon hill will be the highlight of our developments in hong kong.
the group acquired an additional site adjacent to our existing beacon hill residential project last year. the two adjoining lots are situated in an exclusive locale, where the group aims to build prestigious residences that deliver ultimate living quality.
