on behalf of the board of directors (the board), i am hereby pleased to present the 2016 annual report of the company for the year ended 31 december 2016 (the year 2016) to our shareholders.
the year 2016 was a crucial year of the company to lay the foundation for our long-term development. the group has gradually formed five segments, namely new energy, tourism, healthcare, property and investment. these segments have synergistic effects among one another to enhance the development of the company.
through a number of acquisitions during the year 2016, total assets of the group increased by 416% from renminbi (rmb) 9,366,366,000 as at 31 december 2015 to rmb48,294,673,000 as at 31 december 2016.
net assets per share recorded an increase of 291% to rmb1.33 as compared to the year 2015 (the year 2015) (31 december 2015: rmb0.34).
in the year 2016, the revenue of the group increased by approximately 39% to rmb4,311,423,000 (2015: rmb3,095,611,000). gross profit rose by 125% to rmb871,995,000 as compared to the year 2015 (2015: rmb387,338,000). gross profit margin grew by 8 percentage points to 20% as compared to the year 2015. profit for the year 2016 attributable to owners of parent company recorded an increase of 155% to rmb3,105,196,000 as compared to the year 2015 (2015: rmb1,217,827,000). profit margin for the year 2016 attributable to owners of parent company increased by 33 percentage points to 72% as compared to the year 2015. to reward our shareholders for their long-term support, the board recommends the payment of final dividends of rmb1.5 cents per share for the year 2016.
during the year 2016, by way of share exchange offer pursuant to the takeover code, the group successfully acquired 73.91% of the total issued share capital of china high speed transmission equipment group co., ltd. (chs; stock code: 658) a leading enterprise in the wind power equipment industry in the prc and formally entered into the new energy equipment manufacturing sector. the acquisition was formally completed in december 2016. chs is a globally leading supplier of mechanical transmission equipment, and its products are mainly used for wind power generation equipment and various types of industrial mechanical transmission equipment. the wind power generation industry has huge growth potential, under the influence of the energy structure reform policy that is proactively implemented by the prc government as well as the long-term development goals of the prc government relating to renewable energy and green energy. based on a guideline released by the national energy administration (nea) on 3 march 2016, by 2020, non-hydroelectric renewable energy should account for between 5% and 13% of the total electricity consumption for provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions and power companies, with the exception of some non-fossil energy companies, should produce at least 9% of the total electricity from non-hydroelectric renewable energy by 2020. by leveraging on chss strong technical background and leadership position, we are confident to gain greater market share in the global mechanical transmission equipment and new energy sector.
in addition to proactively developing the new energy segment, the formation of five seasons cultural tourism development company limited (five seasons cultural) is regarded as a breakthrough of the group to develop the integrated leisure tourism business. according to the chinas middle class in next decade ( ) report issued by mckinsey & company, by 2022, 76% of the prc urban households will reach the middle class income standard, and annual disposable income of these chinese households will reach the range of rmb60,000 to rmb229,000 by that time. along with the rapid increase in disposable income per capita and the emerging middle class, the chinese consumption concept is experiencing a significant change and gradually shifting from past practical consumption to hedonic consumption. the change in such consumption pattern has brought unprecedented business opportunities for the leisure tourism industry. during the year 2016, the group acquired several projects including nanjing wonder cityproject, laguna project and sheraton project for the development of urban leisure complexes, cultural towns, suburban vacation resorts, global timeshare resorts and other projects around the world. in the future, we will continue to capitalize on our various resources and identify excellent partners to jointly develop and operate the culture tourism resorts.
with the increase in disposable income, the chinese are now pursuing a higher-quality and healthier lifestyle. the provision of healthcare has emerged as a new business opportunity. the prc government recently approved the healthy china 2030 plan as an important policy and as a key segment of the 13th five year plan. while the population in the prc is gradually aging, the market size of the prc healthcare industry has been increased to nearly rmb4 trillion. this market has maintained a compound annual growth rate of over 20% in the past 5 years, and is expected to double in the next 5 years, reaching rmb8 trillion, which is nearly 10% of chinas gross domestic product (the gdp) at that time. during the year 2016, the group further expanded its footprint in the healthcare and maternal and infant care business globally, and successfully acquired (i) shenzhen anke high-tech company limited (shenzhen anke) a medical equipment enterprise, (ii) guangzhou haizhu district life-infinity medical clinic limited (life-infinity) a high-end precision medical institution and (iii) sparrow early learning pty ltd. (sparrow early) an australian early childhood education institution, laying the foundation for further development of the healthcare and maternal and infant care market. on the other hand, during the year 2016, we also successfully invested in hin sang group (international) holding co. ltd. (hin sang; stock code: 6893), medicskin holdings limited (medicskin; stock code: 8307) a hong kong medical skin care enterprise and nanjing sinolife united company limited (nsucl) (stock code: 3332) a nutritional supplements and health food product manufacturing enterprise. through the aforesaid acquisition and investment activities, our healthcare business segment has evolved to cover, among others, medical equipment development and production, medical beauty services, infant healthcare, education and health food production and sales, etc. through the use of such business platform, we will be able to capture the market potential of the healthcare and maternal and infant healthcare industry in an all-round way.
