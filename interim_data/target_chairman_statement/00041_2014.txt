furthermore, given the successful spin off in 2013, a special interim dividend of hk$1 per share was paid for the first half period, and as a final distribution related to the spin-off in 2013, the board declared a special final dividend of hk$0.50 per share for 2013, taking special dividend to hk$1.50 per share for 2013.
in addition to the rebranding of the newly acquired new york hotel as a langham place in may 2013, we opened the langham chicago and rebranded the toronto hotel to our own eaton brand in july 2013. the increased penetration of our brands to these gateway cities helped to enforce langham as a leading international hotel brand. last but not least, we launched the pre-sale on parts of the apartments in our dalian project in september 2013. all-in-all, these key business developments have laid a solid foundation for the group s future earnings. nonetheless, the group s core earnings for 2013 were primarily affected by some one-off items.
the group s core earnings for 2013 dropped 6.8% year-on-year to hk$1,680 million in 2013.
although the underlying performances for the majority of our businesses remained intact in 2013, core earnings were impacted by several factors, including (i) lower attributable income from the spun off hong kong hotels, (ii) booking of pre-opening and re-branding expenses for our hotels in north america and (iii) an increase in administrative expense related to the spin off exercise and professional fees incurred for feasibility studies on various projects.
for the financial year ended 31 december 2013, revenue base on core business of the group amounted to hk$5,419 million, representing a decline of 4.6% year-on-year. the decline was primarily due to a hk$614 million drop in revenue from the hotels division, given the hong kong hotels were spun-off to lhi in may 2013. after the spun off, the returns on our equity stake in the three hong kong hotels were reflected through our investment in lhi, which resulted in a distribution income of hk$189 million in 2013.
core operating income dropped 2.3% year-on- year to hk$2,249 million in 2013. the milder drop in operating profit as compared to revenue was due to increased contributions from segments with higher margins such as management fee income and distribution income. to a lesser extent, improvements in margins from businesses in other operations also contributed to a smaller decline in core operating income in 2013. it should be noted that the increase in distribution income from champion reit was due to our increased shareholdings in the reit, as the distribution per unit declared by champion reit was only up marginally in 2013. nonetheless, the growth in such income was not enough to offset the decline in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (ebitda) of the hotels division, which resulted in an overall decline in core operating income in 2013.
in addition to the decline in core operating income, an increase in administration expense in association with the spin off exercise, as well as professional fees incurred on feasibility studies for various projects, together with an increase in losses from a joint venture (previously called jointly controlled entity) and higher interest expense also contributed to the decrease in core profit.
the increase in losses of a joint venture, which holds the dalian mixed-use development project, was due to increased marketing and administrative expenses incurred for the presale of the residential apartments. whilst interest expense was also higher due to a combination of higher interest rates and additional interest expense incurred in relation to acquisitions of the properties in new york and san francisco in 2013.
as our investment in champion reit s convertible bonds were converted to units in august 2012, no interest income related to such convertible bonds was recorded in 2013. however, interest income achieved by the group in 2013 was still higher than that booked in 2012. such interest income was primarily derived from the deposits of the group s enlarged cash holdings after the spin-off of the hong kong hotels in may 2013. overall, core profit attributable to shareholders amounted to hk$1,680 million, representing a decline of in terms of development, apart from executing projects that were already in the pipeline during the second half of 2013, we had selectively pushed ahead with our plan to grow our asset base and acquired a prime office property in the heart of down town san francisco for us$179 million. at current, we are actively evaluating various investment opportunities, and in particular, we will be targeting those projects that will either be accretive to the group s net asset value, or that are expected to have a synergistic effect with our current businesses. in the near term, we see better risk-return adjusted real estate investment opportunities overseas, especially in the u.s., given undemanding asking prices. should the u.s. economy continues to recover, this will lead to further growth in capital values going in the interim, in order to enhance the return on our cash holdings, a majority of the cash were placed in short term renminbi deposits bearing higher interest, whereas a small portion of the cash holdings were invested in other fixed income, equities or equity related investments. whilst we try to enhance the return on our cash holdings, we only conduct such investments in the most prudent and cautious manner. based on the definition of our core profit, only realized gainslosses or interest incomes from these investments were recognised in 2013 s core profit. for the sake of clarity, non-realized exchange gains in relation to these investments were not included in core profit.

overall, revenue from the hotel division declined by 15% year-on-year to hk$3,480.7 million in 2013, whilst ebitda of the hotels division declined 35.7% year-on-year to hk$672.9 million in 2013. nonetheless, if we exclude the impact of the pre-opening and re-branding expenses, a majority of the overseas hotels had a solid ebitda growth in 2013.

the asking rent (the rental rate based on lettable floor area quoted for new tenancies) at citibank plaza is currently hk$80 85 per sq.ft.. the passing rent (the average rental rate of existing tenancies) weakened marginally from hk$85.12 to hk$84.60 per sq.ft. as leases were rolled over. this resulted in a 0.3% drop in revenue to hk$1,202 million.
after deducting expenses, the net property income of citibank plaza was hk$990 million, a 1.1% decrease year-on-year.
langham place office tower asking rents (based on gross floor area) for office space at langham place have risen this year and are now hk$38 45 per sq.ft. compared to hk$32 40 per sq.ft. a year ago. passing rent increased from hk$28.36 at the end of last year to hk$32.86 as of 31 december 2013. this was a result of positive rental reversion upon the rollover of 51% of the floor area during 2013. the occupancy rate at the langham place office tower was maintained at 99.0% as of 31 december 2013. revenue for the langham place office tower was hk$289 million, a 9.5% increase over the hk$264 million reported last year. net property income grew 7.6% from hk$216 million to hk$232 million.
langham place mall in 2013 the mall continued to enjoy very high levels of foot traffic and remained fully let.
over the twelve months of 2013, tenancies representing 33% of the mall s floor area were rolled over, driving a 25.6% increase in passing base rents (based on lettable floor area)from hk$114.89 per sq.ft. to hk$144.26 per sq.ft..
turnover rent income for 2013 increased by 4.2%, to hk$99 million, equivalent to an additional hk$25.87 per sq.ft. per month in income over the base rents. the overall increase in rent rates resulted in a 16.8% increase in revenue from hk$589 million to hk$688 million. net property income increased by 16.9% from hk$450 million to hk$526 million.
although total net property income for champion reit improved in 2013, distribution growth of the reit was held back by higher borrowing costs. cash interest expenses incurred by the reit increased from hk$143 million in 2012 to hk$251 million in 2013. the increase was primarily due to the issuance of us$400 million of 10-year notes under the medium term note programme at a favourable coupon rate of 3.75% in january 2013, as well as the rollover of over hk$2 billion in bank loans at a higher interest spread.

dalian mixed-use development project the project is located on renmin road in the east harbour area of zhongshan district, the cbd of dalian, liaoning province. it has a total gross floor area of approximately 286,000 square metres and comprises 1,200 high-end apartments and a luxury hotel with approximately 360 rooms. the group has a 50% equity interest in the project and acts as the project manager. it is targeted for completion in two phases from 201415 onward, and upon the completion of excavation and foundation works, phase 1 construction commenced in february 2012. as of the end of 2013, the group had invested hk$631 million for its stake in the project.
a selection of the phase 1 apartments were launched for pre-sale since september 2013 at an average selling price above rmb23,000 per sq.m., generating handsome operating margins. the project sets a new benchmark for luxury properties in the city by offering extraordinarily luxurious ambience with unobstructed sea view overlooking the dalian harbour. it should be noted that the sales and profits on the presold apartments will not be booked in our income statement until handover of the apartments.
investment in lhi on statutory accounting basis, our investment in lhi is classified as a subsidiary, and its results are consolidated on the group s statutory income statement. however, as lhi is principally focused on distributions, the group s core profit will be derived from attributable distribution income, as we believe this will better reflect the financial return and economic interest attributable to our investment in lhi. this entry is also consistent with our practice in accounting for returns from our investment in champion reit, which also focuses on distributions. as lhi was listed on 30 may 2013, distribution income covered the period from 30 may 2013 to 31 december 2013 in 2013.
after taking into consideration of the distributions waived by the group, distribution income from lhi came to hk$189 million in 2013.
in 2013, distribution entitlement in respect of 13.1% of our holdings in the share stapled units of lhi (before the impact of hotel management fee issued in units) will be waived, and the said percentage will drop to approximately 4.4% in 2017 and all of our holdings are entitled to distributions in 2018.
it was a gesture by the group, as a major investor of lhi to waive part of its distributions so as to minimise dilution impact on initial yield to other investors. the dilution arose from additional units issued at the time of the initial public offering. the additional capital has been raised to fund asset enhancement initiatives on the initial portfolio, which should help support performance and value of the properties of lhi going forward.

however, given the group s planned strategy to relocate its hotel management subsidiary from langham place office tower to great eagle centre from january 2014, this had resulted in increased downtime on certain office space when their leases expired during 2013. primarily as a result of the space reserved for the aforesaid relocation, occupancy for the office portion of great eagle centre was lowered to 92.9% as at the end of december 2013, as compared to 97.6% as at the end of december 2012.
while the retail space accounted for a smaller portion of total lettable floor area at great eagle centre, it was benefitted from strong positive rental reversion, which lifted retail average passing rent from hk$79.5 per sq.ft. as of december 2012 to hk$95.9 per sq.ft. as of december 2013.
the retail portion of great eagle centre stayed at close to 100% occupancy throughout 2013.
overall, gross rental income for great eagle centre increased 12% to hk$143.0 million in 2013 (2012: hk$127.7 million). however, net rental income was impacted by booking of additional expenses. these additional expenses are for the relocation and upgrading of the cooling water pumping facilities and other maintenance capital expenditure that cannot be capitalized. as a result, net rental income only rose 3.6% to hk$128.2 million in 2013 (2012: hk$123.8 million).
it should be noted that after the relocation of the group s hotel management subsidiary to the great eagle centre in january 2014, 14,852 sq.ft.
of lettable floor area will be withdrawn from the total available floor area at great eagle centre. as such, occupancy for the great eagle centre will be adjusted accordingly in order to reflect the lower available floor area at great eagle centre.

average passing rent at the wanchai gap road property rose 23.6% year-on-year, while occupancy grew by 2.9ppt year-on-year. the increase in rental income from the wanchai gap road property had more than compensated the drop in rental income of the two serviced apartments in happy valley, which witnessed lower occupancies amid weaker demand.
overall occupancy for the three serviced apartments still dropped 4.2ppt to 73.6% in 2013 from 77.8% in 2012. however, achieved rental rates rose 10.3% from hk$41.7 per sq.ft.
on gross floor area in 2012 to hk$46.0 per sq.ft.
in 2013. gross rental income rose 10.3% year- on-year to hk$45.1 million in 2013. although with higher operating expenses incurred for the wanchai gap road property, and lower net rental income achieved by the two serviced apartments in happy valley, there was a small drop in net rental income, which dropped 1.4% year-on-year to hk$28.1 million in 2013.

vacancy rates in the san francisco area continued to decline over 2013. as such, asking rental rates in the area remained on an upward trend in 2013. hence, spot rents at 353 sacramento, 500 ygnacio, and the recently acquired 123 mission street, all rose to levels above their average passing rents, which should lead to positive rental reversions in the years ahead.
however, spot rents at 2700 ygnacio as at the end of 2013 were still below its average passing rent.
operating statistics of the portfolio presented in the table below included that of 123 mission street from 21 november 2013.
as at the end of (on net rentable area) occupancy 91.1% 88.9% average passing rent us$36.5 us$33.4 excluding the newly acquired 123 mission street, occupancy of the portfolio would stood at 93.4% as at the end of 2013 as compared to 88.9% as at the end of 2012, whereas average passing rent for the portfolio would be us$34.5 per sq.ft. on net rentable area as of december 2013, as compared with us$33.4 per sq.ft. as at of december 2012.
overall, gross rental income, which included approximately one month of contribution from the newly acquired 123 mission street, rose 12.1% to hk$121.3 million in 2013 (2012: hk$108.3 million). with primarily lower tenant inducement costs incurred at 353 sacramento street, net rental income rose 22.3% to hk$51.6 million in 2013 (2012: hk$42.2 million).
we are currently under preliminary discussion, which may or may not eventually materialize, to form an office property fund with other independent third parties, and we will be the asset manager of that fund. the fund s strategy is to acquire offices in major u.s. cities that provide reasonable yields with capital value appreciation on statutory basis, after consolidating the results of champion reit and lhi, the consolidated net debts of the group as of 31 december 2013 was hk$15,873 million, an increase of hk$4,036 million compared with that as of 31 december 2012. the increase in net borrowings during the year was due to a combination of factors including the net cash proceeds from the spin-off of the three hong kong hotels, as offset by new loans drawn by lhil upon spin off; loans drawn for the acquisition of certain floors of citibank tower by champion reit and acquisition by the group of two properties in united states. in addition, surplus cash fund invested in quoted shares, bonds and link notes were not classified as cash on hand.
equity attributable to shareholders, based on professional valuation of the group s investment properties as of 31 december 2013 and the depreciated costs of the group s hotel properties (including hong kong hotel properties held by lhi), amounted to hk$49,956 million, representing an increase of hk$7,185 million compared to the restated value of hk$42,771 million as of 31 december 2012. the increase was mainly attributable to the profit for the year and surplus credited to other reserves on deemed disposal of the three hong kong hotels.
for accounting purpose, on consolidation the group is treated as to include entire debts of champion reit and lhi. based on such statutorily reported consolidated net debts ( reported debts ) and equity attributable to shareholders, the gearing ratio of the group as at 31 december 2013 was 31.8%. however, since only 60.35% and 57.72% of the net debts of champion reit and lhi respectively are attributable to the group, and debts of these two separately listed subsidiary groups had no recourse to the group, we consider it is more meaningful to account for the net debts based on sharing of net assets of listed subsidiaries instead of reported debts, and the resulting net cash position is illustrated below.

* net debts(cash) based on the sharing of net assets of the separately listed subsidiary groups.
because of the persistent low interest rate environment and in order to enhance return to shareholders, as a normal treasury function the group has been prudently investing in quality short-term bonds which are intended to be held to maturity, principal protected notes with reputable banks and financial institutions as counter-parties and selected quality equities. as at 31 december 2013, the market value of these bonds and notes amounted to hk$2,048 million and invested securities amounted to hk$1,159 million. should these amounts be taken into account, the consolidated net borrowings and gearing ratio would be reduced to hk$12,666 million and 25.4% respectively. the net cash based on sharing of net assets of champion reit and lhi would be correspondingly increased to hk$7,018 million.
the following description is based on the statutorily consolidated financial statements: our gross debts (including medium term note) after consolidating champion reit and lhi in hong kong dollars amounted to hk$26,584 million as of 31 december 2013. foreign currency gross debts as of 31 december 2013 amounted to the equivalent of hk$6,784 million, of which the equivalent of hk$4,205 million or 62% was on the net consolidated finance cost incurred during the year was hk$394.1 million. overall interest cover at the reporting date was 7.7 times.
liquidity and debt maturity
as of 31 december 2013, our cash, bank deposits and undrawn loan facilities amounted to a total of hk$11,462 million. the majority of our loan facilities are secured by properties with sufficient value to loan coverage. the following is a profile of the maturity of our outstanding debts as of 31 december 2013: within 1 year 26.5% 1 2 years 11.3% 3 5 years 50.5% over 5 years 11.7% pledge of assets at 31 december 2013, properties of the group with a total carrying value of approximately hk$57,509 million (31 december 2012: hk$64,649 million) were mortgaged or pledged to secure credit facilities granted to its subsidiaries.
commitments and contingent
at 31 december 2013, the group has authorised capital expenditure for investment properties and property, plant and equipment which is not provided for in these consolidated financial statements amounting to hk$104 million (2012: hk$527 million) of which hk$77 million (2012: hk$454 million) was contracted for.
at 31 december 2013, the group has outstanding financial commitment in respect of capital injection to a joint venture of rmb25.8 million (equivalent to hk$33 million) (2012: rmb26.5 other than that, the group did not have any significant commitments and contingent liabilities at the end of the reporting period.

it appears that the low u.s. interest rate environment should continue for the near term.
despite the recent economic deceleration in china, the third plenum in november 2013 has produced a detailed reform blueprint for economic and social change for the next decade, which hopefully should provide the foundation for the next stage of growth in china. nevertheless, considering the number of possible risks that could trigger an economic downdraft this year, we must remain vigilant as the outlook seems uncertain.
in particular, we should be prepared to deal with the upcoming impact from the fed s tapering, and be ready to respond to uncertainties in the global in 2014, we expect distributions and hotel management incomes from lhi to increase so as to reflect a full year of contribution after its listing in may 2013. for the three hotels owned by lhi, they have all witnessed an increase in revpar in the first six weeks of 2014. booking pace is supporting growth trend into march 2014. however, with little visibility on future demand, macroeconomic trends of the major feeder markets will still play a key role in determining revpar growth for the hong kong hotels in 2014.
in terms of the outlook for the hotels outside of hong kong, our hotels in the u.s. will be benefitted from further recovery in the u.s.
economy, where growth in hotel supply is limited for at least the next two years.
for the hotel in london, we are cautiously optimistic, given signs of improving economic conditions in the u.k. and the eurozone.
performance of the hotels in australasia should be steady, whereas further impact from the rebranding of the hotel in toronto may affect performance of the hotel in 2014.
for champion reit, there should be some downside for the income of citibank plaza.
fortunately, strong rental growth at langham place property should be able to counteract the potential weakness at citibank plaza. however, higher interest costs may once again hold back the growth in distributable income.
although the economy at large continues to be challenging in some of the markets we operate, the group is well-prepared to face these challenges. looking forward, our strong financial position and strong cash rich position, as well as cash flow generation will enable us to pursue further opportunities for strengthening our growth prospects in the long term.
