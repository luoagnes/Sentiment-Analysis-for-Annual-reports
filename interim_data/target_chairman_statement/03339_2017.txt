the international economy featured slowdown of various countries. against this backdrop, the gdp growth in the prc in 2016 declined to 6.7% and reached the record low for these years, while the international trade also witnessed a significant decrease in the growth rate. generally speaking, the construction machinery industry in the prc is still going through restructure and recovery. the unsolved overcapacity issue, coupled with the intensifying market competition attributable to the declining demand, led to higher sector exposures and caused numerous construction machinery enterprises suffering from losses.
starting from the second half of 2016, driven by the construction of infrastructures such as railways, highways and hydraulic engineering and amid the increase in the prices of bulk raw materials and nonferrous metals such as coal and iron ore, the construction machinery industry in the prc, after experiencing a five-years continuous and significant decline, began to pick up from the bottom and became stabilized, which represents a slow recovery in industry. riding on the unique opportunity, china lonking was able to record a positive year-on-year increase for the sixth consecutive month in the second half by gaining market shares, controlling risks, strengthening management and promoting quality, thus achieving our annual growth target for 2016 in the end. therefore, all the key performance indicators and the development quality of china lonking obviously outstripped other players in industry, which was demonstrated by the followings: i. in 2016, the sales revenue witnessed a full-year positive growth of 6.57% through our sustained efforts as compared with the negative growth of 11.19% in the first half of the year, while the domestic business experienced a growth of more than 10%, all of which has realized the targets set by the board at the beginning of 2016. among them, the sales revenue generated from loaders above 3 tons increased by 3.4% and the sales volume of loaders below 3 tons inceased by 124.4%, enabling lonking to keep its top position in respect of market share in domestic market of loaders. the sales volume of fork lifts increased by 38.6%, which has continued to narrow down its gap with the top two sellers. the sale volume of excavators recorded an year-on-year increase of 24.2%, the sale volume of road rollers increased by 20.2% and the sales revenue generated from components increased by 9.58% year-on-year. in terms of overseas business, sales generated from export decreased by 36% under the influence of the overall decline in demand and the enhanced risks control level of holding company.
