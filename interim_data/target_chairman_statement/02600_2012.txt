product market reviews the supply and demand as well as the price of aluminum are closely tied to changes in the global and the prc macro-economies. changes in the global and prc economy have a significant impact on the primary aluminum market in 2011, caused by volatility in the macro-economies and the turmoil in the middle east, the price of aluminum fluctuated widely during the year, with an initial upswing followed by a continuous slide. in the first half of the year, factors such as the recovery of the global economy, the quantitative easing policy of us and the turbulence in the middle east drove up the price of bulk commodities, which was ensued by a surge in aluminum price. in may, the price of three-month aluminum at london metal exchange (hereafter as lme ) hit year-high of usd2,797 per tonne. however, following the spread of sovereign debt crisis in europe, the price of aluminum plummeted in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter, with the price of three-month aluminum at lme fell to a year-low of usd1,962 per tonne, representing a drop of over 30%. a similar trend can be observed for the domestic aluminum price, but with a slight time lag as compared to that of lme. in the first half of the year, exports of domestic aluminum products picked up amidst the rumour of adjustments in tax rebate polices on aluminum exports, which expedited the clearance of inventories whilst pushing up the domestic aluminum price. the prices of three-month aluminum at shanghai futures exchange (hereafter as shfe ) increased to a year-high of rmb18,600 per tonne in early august, after which the price of aluminum fluctuated widely with a downward trend. the average three-month aluminum futures prices for 2011 at lme and shfe were usd2,410 per tonne and rmb16,893 per tonne, representing a year-on-year increase of 6.1% and 4.4%, respectively.
in 2011, the global output of primary aluminum was approximately 45.60 million tonnes, representing a year-on-year increase of 8.8%; the global consumption of primary aluminum was approximately 45.10 million tonnes, representing a year-on-year increase of 10.0%; the domestic output of primary aluminum was approximately 19.45 million tonnes, representing a year-on-year increase of 24.3% and the domestic consumption of primary aluminum was approximately 19.50 million tonnes, representing a year-on-year increase of 15.4%. as of the end of december in 2011, the capacity utilization rate of primary aluminum enterprises in the world (inclusive of the prc) was 84%, while that of the prc was in 2011, international and domestic prices of spot alumina showed an upward then downward trend.
at the beginning of the year, prices of primary aluminum and alumina gradually surged as the economy was gathering pace, but after september the price of alumina fell in tandem with aluminum price.
the international price of spot alumina peaked at usd440 per tonne, and hit the trough at usd310 per tonne, with an average price of usd413 per tonne, representing a year-on-year increase of 19%; whereas the domestic price of alumina peaked at rmb3,000 per tonne, and hit the trough at rmb2,600 per tonne, with an average of rmb2,786 per tonne, representing a year-on-year decrease of 3%.
the global output of alumina for 2011 was approximately 90.67 million tonnes, representing a year-on-year increase of 10.6% and the consumption was approximately 89.40 million tonnes, representing a year-on-year increase of 7.9%. the domestic output of alumina was approximately 38.81 million tonnes, representing a year-on-year increase of 24.4%; the demand for alumina was approximately 39.04 million tonnes, representing a year-on-year increase of 10.5%; imported alumina amounted to approximately 1.88 million tonnes in 2011, representing a year-on-year decrease of 56.4%.

aluminum fabrication market in china, the building, transportation and power industries accounted for approximately two-thirds of the aluminum consumption. with the 2010 macro control policies on real estate coming into play and the rolling out of regulatory measures on car purchases in certain cities in 2011, construction of commodity housing and automobile sales have been impacted to a considerable extent, which resulted in a slowing down of growth of aluminum consumption in 2011.

in 2011, in face of an acute and complicated operational environment with upward adjustments in interest rates, tariff hikes and mounting raw materials prices as well as volatility in aluminum price, the group adhered to structural adjustments and strategic transformation measures aiming at bringing down costs while increasing efficiency, sustaining production and operation as well as ensuring capital stability to reap profits. such measures include tapping new income sources, cutting expenditure, optimum utilization of assets, tightened investment control and strengthened fundamental management.
