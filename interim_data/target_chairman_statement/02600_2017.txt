product market reviews
primary aluminum market
in 2016, the performance of primary aluminum price was significantly better than the market expectation. the international and domestic price of primary aluminum was heading upward against fluctuations.
in terms of the international market, benefiting from the improving macro risk appetite in the global market in 2016, the fundamentals of bulk commodities showed a favorable trend on the whole and prices of nonferrous metals bounced back from the low at the beginning of the year. at the beginning of the year, the price of the three-month aluminum futures at lme sprung up to usd1,500 per tonne. due to the preferential factors such as the rebound of macro environment and the slowing growth of the electrolytic aluminum supply in the global market, the price continually went upwards and surmounted usd1,600 per tonne in march. in june, the stronger expectation for interest rate rise by the us federal reserve and the eu referendum in the uk added new uncertainties to the macro risks of the market and brought along the corresponding decrease and flagging fluctuations in the aluminum price. in the fourth quarter of 2016, as driven by the postponement of the interest rate rise resolution by the us federal reserve, the relentless surge of international crude oil price and the tight supply of spot aluminum in china, a large amount of capital flew into the market and the international aluminum price peaked in november at usd1,794.5 per tonne. afterwards, the market was running stable gradually and the aluminum price smoothed down from its peak for the year due to profit taking. in 2016, the respective average prices of spot aluminum and three-month aluminum futures at lme amounted to usd1,604 per tonne and usd1,605 per tonne, representing a decrease of 3.5% and 4.6% from 2015, respectively. the decrease was narrowed down significantly.
in terms of the domestic market, as affected by the traditional off season, holidays and festivals and other factors, the domestic price of aluminum futures showed a sluggish trend and fluctuated slightly on the whole at the beginning of the year; while during the same period, thanks to the flexible production implemented in succession by the domestic electrolytic aluminum enterprises at the end of 2015, the domestic price for spot aluminum stayed firm, which gave support to the price of the aluminum futures to some extent. after the spring festival, the domestic price of the aluminum futures rebounded rapidly upon a slight decrease, which was in striking contrast with the price plunge after the spring festival in the past years. under the sustainable balance between supply and demand, the domestic price of the aluminum futures continued to rise and constantly broke the record. in april, the price of the three-month aluminum futures at shfe quickly reached the peak in the first half of the year at rmb13,075 per tonne against the breakthrough price of rmb11,000 per tonne in march. afterwards, the domestic aluminum price began to fall and fluctuated at low levels. in the second half of september, following the implementation of the provisions on the administration of the running of transport vehicles with out-of-gauge freight on the road () lately promulgated by china, the significant increase in the truck transport cost of electrolytic aluminum and the nearly full capacity of rail transport resulted in reduction of aluminum ingots inventory and increasingly tight supply of spot aluminum ingots. consequently, the aluminum price surged vigorously. in the wake of the influx of a large amount of capital in the futures market, the price of the three-month aluminum futures at shfe approached rmb15,000 per tonne, being the highest in the past two years, and it did not fall until the profit takings at the end of the year. in 2016, the respective average prices of spot aluminum and three-month aluminum futures at shfe amounted to rmb12,261 per tonne and rmb12,101 per tonne, representing a decrease of 0.1% and 1.6% from 2015, respectively.
according to the statistics, the global output and consumption of primary aluminum for 2016 were approximately 58.87 million tonnes and approximately 59.60 million tonnes, respectively, representing a yearon-year increase of 2.9% and 3.0%, respectively. the domestic output and consumption of primary aluminum were approximately 32.50 million tonnes and approximately 32.70 million tonnes, respectively, representing a year-on-year increase of 4.8% and 6.7% respectively. as of the end of december 2016, the capacity utilization rate of primary aluminum in the world (inclusive of the prc) was 79.81%, while that of the prc was approximately 75.23%.

in 2016, owning to the upsurge of the primary aluminum price and the increase in resumed production, the alumina price hiked up relentlessly.
in terms of the international market, as driven by the significant improvement of the demand and supply in the global aluminum market, especially the substantial reduction of the electrolytic aluminum production volume and the rising cost of raw materials in china, the domestic and international prices of the electrolytic aluminum began to recover steadily from the lows in recent years. under such effect, the global alumina prices also began to bounce back and manifested an overall vigorously rising tendency for the year. in 2016, the lowest alumina price in the overseas market was usd197 per tonne at the beginning of the year, and the highest was the usd350.5 per tonne at the end of the year, representing an increase of 77.9% for the year.
the annual average alumina price was usd254 per tonne, representing a decrease of 15.8% from 2015.
in terms of the domestic market, on account of the implementation of production reduction by domestic alumina enterprises and a favorable relationship of supply and demand, the alumina price bottomed out at the beginning of the year and began to accelerate its pace after the spring festival. after approaching the highest for the first half of the year at rmb1,998 per tonne in may, the price declined as affected by the resumed production of alumina. nevertheless, as demands for alumina increased owing to the strong recovery momentum of production capacity of electrolytic aluminum plants, together with new transportation policies, rising costs, accidental events and other factors, the alumina price spiked since august 2016 and remained high till the end of the year. in 2016, the lowest alumina price in the domestic market was rmb1,525 per tonne at the beginning of the year, and the highest was the rmb3,080 per tonne at the end of the year, representing an increase of 101.97% for the year. the annual average alumina price was rmb2,070 per tonne, representing a decrease of 11.7% from 2015.
according to the statistics, the respective global output and consumption of alumina for 2016 was approximately 121.22 million tonnes and approximately 122.20 million tonnes, representing a year-on-year increase of 0.3% and 3.7%, respectively. the respective domestic output and consumption of alumina were approximately 60.16 million tonnes and approximately 64.40 million tonnes, representing a year-on-year increase of 2.6% and 4.2%, respectively. as of the end of december 2016, the alumina capacity utilization rate of alumina enterprises in the world (inclusive of the prc) was approximately 81.26%, while that of the prc was approximately 81.19%.
