chairman s statement i am pleased to present our annual report for the financial year ended 30 june 2014.

underpinned by prevailing low interest rates, abundant liquidity and gradual recovery in global growth, leading stock markets continued to go higher in the twelve months to june 2014. the us and europe led the rallies with double-digit gains while emerging markets recovered some of their losses from the preceding year. in china, there were ongoing concerns on their banking system and property market but the situation improved after a number of policy relaxation and mini-stimulus measures were introduced by the government.
against this backdrop our core businesses of the group had made steady progress. we are able to report a fair set of results across various market environments under which the group operated.

the group s consolidated profit attributable to equity shareholders for the financial year 201314, after taxation and non-controlling interests, amounted to hk$5.8 billion, as compared to hk$6.3 billion for the previous year. this was achieved with substantial contributions from principal investment together with higher profit contributions this year from the group s other core businesses.
in addition to the interim dividend of hk$1.00 per share already paid, the directors will be recommending a final dividend of hk$3.00 per share (2013: hk$1.50 per share) at the forthcoming annual general meeting. this gives a total dividend of hk$4.00 per share, keeping intact a healthy dividend pay-out track record over the years.

with major central banks maintaining an accommodative bias and expectations by investors that interest rates would not be raised soon, a number of global stock indices reached or traded near their all-time highs by the end of our financial year. our investment activities performed well on the back of the favourable economic environment in the major economies and we took timely opportunity of these rallies to realise profits for the year. the better result was also contributed by our investments held as at 30 june 2014 which were subject to stock prices in developed countries have been making steady and mostly uninterrupted gains since the end of the financial crisis. while supported by low interest rate policies and improving fundamentals, some price correction in the future would appear inevitable due to higher valuations. results at reported dates for our investment will remain dependent on market conditions, and performance may vary due to short-term fair value price movements and marked-to-market valuations at that time.
each of our core businesses will continue respectively to focus on building a high performance business and strengthening the foundations for sustainable profitability and growth, and in the process to enhance our capital value.
property development and investment
guocoland faced a challenging operating environment as property price-curb measures imposed in its principal markets in singapore and china persisted during the financial year. nevertheless, guocoland carried on with the execution of its current projects and made good progress on construction and monetisation of its development projects. during the financial year, temporary occupation permits were received for sophia residence in singapore; and seasons park, guocoland s first residential project in tianjin, china. guocoland also continued to sell units at goodwood residence in singapore, which was completed in june 2013. recognition of profits from singapore projects and seasons park contributed significantly to its improved operating results for the year.
guocoland is working full steam ahead for the construction of its two iconic projects namely tanjong pagar centre in singapore, and damansara city in kuala lumpur, malaysia. both are large-scale integrated mixed use developments comprising office, retail, residential and hotel spaces. when completed, they would be landmarks in these two capital cities. tanjong pagar centre will have the tallest building in singapore at 290 metres.
