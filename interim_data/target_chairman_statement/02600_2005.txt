primary aluminum market driven by the booming global economy and the weak us dollar, the global consumption of primary aluminum is surging at the highest rate in the recent 20 years, resulting in the further increase of metal prices. for 2004, the average three-month primary aluminum futures price on the london metals exchange (the lme ) was us$1,723 per tonne (which had surged to us$2,000 per tonne, hitting a new high in 9 years), representing an increase of 20.3% over the previous year, where china still acted as an active support to market. in 2004, the domestic aluminum market experienced noticeable price fluctuations. during the first half year, aluminum prices continued to increase as driven by the international market. the three-month aluminum futures price on shanghai futures exchange (the shfe ) increased up to rmb19,300 per tonne, being the highest in the past decade. however, domestic aluminum prices recorded considerable fluctuations during the second half year due to the influence of the prc s macroeconomic control. the annual average three-month futures price on shfe in 2004 was rmb16,417 per tonne, representing an increase of 13.1% over the previous year.

from the company s perspective, the market situation will continue to be critical in 2005, and production operations continue to face many challenges, mainly " an increase in production cost resulting from the lasting increase in prices of raw materials and " continuing power shortages and transportation bottlenecks could cause difficulties in production " cancellation of tax refund for aluminium export out of prc will decrease aluminium export from the prc and result in intensified competition in the domestic aluminium market.
for this reason, the company will take effective measures based on in-depth studies and analysis of the state s policies and the market environment. in 2005, the company will continue to carry out various innovations to strengthen the management and advance technological progress, together with the company s rapid growth and all-round success in various tasks, this will lay a solid foundation for the company to become a first-class world enterprise. the company s major targets in 2005 are as follows: " in addition to securing its advantageous position in the prc, the company will speed up construction of alumina and primary aluminum projects, put more efforts in exploitation of bauxite resources to increase its resource and market shares, and further expand financing channels to sharpen its core competitive edge.
