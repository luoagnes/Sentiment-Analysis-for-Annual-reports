the chinese pharmaceutical market remained complex and volatile in 2012. during the first half of 2012, the chinese pharmaceutical market was consistently suppressed due to sluggish global economic growth and the chinese government regulatory policies on the pharmaceutical industry. however, as the global economy starting to rebound since the second half of 2012, the chinese government continued to increase investment in the chinese pharmaceutical market and released industry support policies, leading the chinese pharmaceutical market to pick up gradually. despite the volatile market conditions, with the in-depth understanding of the chinese pharmaceutical market, firm implementation of the two core development strategies the continuous introduction and development of products and expansion of promotion and sales network, as well as the unique product portfolio and excellent market execution abilities, the group still achieved satisfactory growth. during the reporting period, the group recorded turnover of us$281.9 million (2011: us$210.4 million), representing an increase of 34.0% over the same period of last year, while profit for the period reached us$85.1million (2011: us$62.4 million), up 36.5% from the corresponding year of last year. basic earnings per share was us3.522 cents (2011: us2.624 cents), representing an increase of 34.2% over the same period of last year.
the group achieved stable growth mainly due to the continuous establishment and effective implementation of its market and product development strategies in line with the development of the chinese pharmaceutical market during the reporting period. the continuing expansion of the group s marketing and promotion network, the strengthened network penetration and hospital coverage, and the refinement of market management for the agency promotion model and products, improved the growth in sales volume of the group s major products.
product introduction and development during the reporting period, the group continued its efforts in product branding and expert network expansion for the products under the direct academic promotion network (the direct network ), by organizing over 1,000 academic activities at various levels to explore new applications for the products together with doctors who make prescriptions and by constantly enhancing the penetration of the products in the traditional departments at hospitals, as well as improving development of hospital coverage to expand the coverage of the products in the market. for products under the agency promotion network (the agency network ), the group continued to enhance and refine the management to agents, paid close attention to tendering and pricing of its products, and fully utilized the business advantages of the agents in various regions. meanwhile, for products with certain professional academic requirements, the group also combined its academic promotion experiences to enhance academic supports for the agency network.

while maintaining steady revenue growth from its flagship products and potential products, the group also continued to screen and to introduce suitable products. in product introduction, the group combined the characteristics of both direct and agency networks to select products with academic differentiations as well as competitive market edges. in terms of the methods used for product introduction, the group has enhanced the stability and controllability requirements of products at the product introduction stage. aside from employing the original product agency method to in-license products, the group also enhanced its bargaining power over controlling rights of the products. regardless of the type of cooperation, the group aims at long- term cooperation with manufacturers to ensure stable and long-term development of products in the chinese market. during the reporting period, the group successfully signed five new products. in august 2012, the group signed an agreement with beijing yadong biopharmaceutical co., ltd to purchase the exclusive sales rights of its three traditional chinese medicine ( tcm ) - yin lian qing gan ke li, xiang fu yi xue kou fu ye, ma jiang jiao nang - in china for 20 years. these three products will be sold exclusively in the chinese market through the group s agency network, which is the second batch of products introduced with the controlling product rights after xidakang (protein hydrolysate oral solutionoral protein hydrolysate) of the group. in december 2012, the group successfully signed an agreement with vifor pharma for the exclusive sales and distribution of maltofer and uro-vaxom in china. although this is a product agency agreement, the agency period (which starts upon the dates on which the products are granted import drug license registration in china) is for 10 years and shall be automatically extended for a further 5 years if the appointed sales targets are achieved. this long-term agreement is a new attempt for the group to in-license products by using of the product agency method, and will also be one of the key considerations of the group to introduce future products under the product agency method. since the above two products are strong in their academic nature, they will be sold through the group s direct network. in addition to maltofer and uro-vaxom , which require import drug license registration in china, the group has three other products undergoing import drug license registration.
moreover, the group has a national class one new drug with independent intellectual property rights - tyroseuleutide (cms024), a polypeptide drug used to treat primary liver cancer. phase iii clinical study for this drug, entitled a randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled, multicenter phase iii study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tyroseuleutide for injection in the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma , is progressing smoothly at over 20 hospitals in china. as at the 31 december 2012, the group has already received 381 informed consent forms ( icf ) and successfully enrolled 176 subjects, exceeding half of the planned 300 subjects. meanwhile, the construction of the new production plant for tyroseuleutide, located in the new region of pingshan, shenzhen, china, is also in progress, and the principal part of the construction project for the manufacturing facility commenced during the reporting period.
