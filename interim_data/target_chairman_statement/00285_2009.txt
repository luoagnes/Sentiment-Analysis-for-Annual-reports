byd electronic has been pursuing the operation strategy of optimizing a highly vertical integrated one-stop service, providing handset components and modules and assembly services respectively. during the year, the assembly services of the company recorded rapid growth. however, the increasing price sensitivity of international leading handset manufacturers to the products supplied by handset component producers, increase in raw material prices, as well as increase in research and development and operation management fees necessary for enhancing product mix of the company during the year, created pressure to the profitability of the company.
