chairman s statement on behalf of biostime international holdings limited (the company ) and its subsidiaries (collectively the group ), i am glad to present our annual report for the year ended 31 december 2015.

during the year of 2015, the group reached a new stage of its development. through its acquisition of an 83% equity interest of swisse wellness group pty ltd ( swisse ) in september 2015, the group has repositioned itself as an all-round premium family nutrition and care provider. in the baby nutrition and care market in china, the group is in leading positions across all major channels. meanwhile, swisse is the market leader with strong brand recognition in the australian vitamin, herbal and mineral supplements ( vhms ) segment.
with the financial results of swisse consolidated into those of the group for the fourth quarter of 2015, the group s total revenue for the year ended 31 december 2015 reached rmb4,818.6 million and its net profit for the year reached rmb293.3 million. among the group s total revenue, 82.4% was generated from the baby nutrition and care products segment, while the remaining 17.6% was derived from the adult nutrition and care products segment.
during the year under review, the chinese infant formula market maintained high single digit growth, but competition intensified at the same time because of the entrance of new competitors and increasing industry-wide promotional activities. amid the more challenging environment, the group kept a leading position in this market. according to nielsen, an independent market research firm, the group s share of the overall infant formula market in china increased from 5.6% in 2014 to 5.9% in 2015, making the group the sixth largest player in the overall infant formula market. in terms of online sales, the group has quickly gained market share since it launched b2c online sales in the second half of 2014 and ranked among the top 10 industry players with a market share of 1.5% in 2015.

business review (continued) the group s revenue derived from the baby nutrition and care products segment for the year under review was rmb3,968.7 million, decreasing by 16.1% from that of 2014. the decrease was mainly attributable to the one- off discount offered to distributors on the previous version of biostime-branded infant formulas for the preparation of the launch of sn-2 plus balanced formulas. such new formulas were proven to promote the balanced growth of babies by a clinical study which the group conducted jointly with its strategic partners. these new products have now been distributed to the retail outlets nationwide and received positive feedback from both member stores and end-consumers. alongside the launch of the sn-2 plus series, the group has also placed new commercials on tv and advertisements on the internet, highlighting its milk source from normandy, france and the sn-2 plus lipid structure technology to differentiate its products from those of competitors. the group is confident that the sn-2 plus balanced formulas will help it to maintain competitive advantage and achieve positive growth in the long run.
regarding the adult nutrition and care products segment, swisse contributed incremental sales equivalent to rmb849.9 million to the group for the fourth quarter of 2015. based on the research report of an independent market research company, swisse became the no.1 brand in the total australian vitamin and herbal market in 2015. in china, swisse is currently the no. 1 brand in the healthcare category on both tmall and taobao. this strong momentum was mainly driven by swisse s dedication to innovation, sophisticated marketing as well as the rapidly growing indirect sales in china. swisse successfully has launched in singapore and the united kingdom and will continue its global roll-out in select countries in europe, asia and north america.
to align with the new positioning as a leading premium family nutrition and care provider, the group has integrated its previous biostime business unit, adimil business unit and bmcare business unit into a baby nutrition and care business unit, and has also established a dedicated swisse china business unit to support swisse s business development in china. under these circumstances, the strategic objective of mama100 e-commerce platform has been revised to be an internal service platform, which will be dedicated to the sales and marketing of the group s products exclusively. the group believes that this new structure will help integrate resources and achieve higher operating efficiency for its long-term business growth.

looking ahead, the group believes that the baby nutrition and care market in china remains attractive and will be further boosted by the full implementation of two-child policy, which will have a positive and significant impact on the number of newborns. in addition, the chinese vhms segment represents a large market with enormous growth potential. it currently has a market size of approximately rmb100 billion and is expected to grow at a double digit cagr from 2015 to 2019 driven by an aging population, chinese consumers growing awareness of health and well-being and increasing disposable income. another tailwind for this market is the recently announced administrative measures for registration and filing of health food 0 o ep t ; q p hh { t l 0) to be effective on 1 july 2016, which requires only filing for certain imported vitamin and mineral supplements using approved raw materials, and this policy will generally shorten the approval process for health food to be sold in traditional channels. the group is confident that its new strategy and strong execution capability will set its business up for success and help capture the opportunities in both the baby and adult nutrition and care segments.
