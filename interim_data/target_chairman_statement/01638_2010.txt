with its sound vision, back in 2004, the group realized that with the rapid growth in the pear river delta, the land resources would be scarce, and the local government would learn from the experience of hong kong on redevelopment to improve city planning and increase land supply. as such, the group embarked on active participation in relevant redevelopment projects in 2004. successes were gained on woodland height phase 8 and replication of redevelopment projects like the now well-received jincui garden project was achieved. these years of practice and exploration allow the group to enrich its experience and professionalism in the sector. as of 31 december 2009, the site area of redevelopment projects within the pearl river delta for which the group had entered into contractual arrangements was approximately 4.2 million sq. m.
