sze tin yau co-chairman of the board to all shareholders, on behalf of the board (the board ) of directors (the directors ) of the company, i am pleased to present the results of the group for the year ended 31 december 2015.
the global economic growth continued to slow down in 2015. with global financial market fluctuation intensifying, commodity prices continued its downturn, and trade protection and currency competitive risk escalated, the momentum of the economic growth of developed economies in usa and european countries had slowed down. the growth rate of emerging market economies declined and the chemical fiber industry was in its downturn period. however, the group has always adhered to the vision of aspiring to be the world s premier supplier of consumer products, providing eco-friendly products for the public and continued to enhance the development of differentiated chemical fiber and functional environmentally-friendly polyester thin film products.

looking back into the past year, the profitability of the chemical fiber industry stayed at a historically low level. market prices of our major raw materials, namely purified terephthalic acid ( pta ) and mono ethylene glycol ( meg ), went down as a result of the significant decrease in crude oil price. therefore, the price of chemical fiber products decreased accordingly, and such decrease had directly affected our product price trend. china s textile products export remained weak in 2015. although the domestic sales growth rate of apparel, footwear and home furnishings had slowed down, such growth remained stable.
nevertheless, as consumer confidence and income growth rate in general remained low and had limited room for growth, coupled with the frequent fluctuations in the market prices of bulk commodities, the price of our products declined to different extents despite a strong market demand for our products and a steady growth in the group s sale volume during the year.

the group has always paid attention to upstream resources, tracked and kept technologies for upstream raw materials, such as renewable materials, bio-based materials, etc, as well as raising the proportion of recyclable products.
we were the first to realize the industrialization technologies of large capacity polyester trace additive modification, and the first to propose the applied in-situ polymerizing technologies in the industry to introduce large capacity polyester innovation in the industry, as well as on-line recycling of wasted filament and wasted film. such innovation enabled us to realize recycling economy and put us in a leading position in the industry.
in addition, by using lithium bromide, we have recycled polyester residual steam and were the first to carry out the spin heat medium electric heating boilers re-engineering under own initiative, and stressed importance on eco-friendly and low- carbon development model while producing.
as regards to market development, during the year, the group shifted from selling physical products in the past to the marketing strategies of mainly relying on product quality and personalized quality services. with more focus on customers experience, feedback from customers was timely communicated to the technology and production center, whereby changing the unilateral communication previously to bilateral interaction, and especially focused on fast and efficient product after-sales services. the company has constantly been optimizing settlement methods and carrying out training on staff to enable their service consciousness to achieve the marketing management optimization target.

with the arrival of polyester melt polymerization equipmentzoqzt-p one after another, their installation is underway. upon the completion of the expansion plan of polyester thin films, our total production capacity of polyester thin films will reach 255,000 tons per year, and by that time, we will become the largest polyester thin film production enterprise in southern china.
the group has sound regional advantages. with convenient raw material sources in the region, the well-developed light industries such as the apparel, footwear and hats and food in the downstream sectors have vast demand for plastic packages. the market capacity within the region is tremendous.
by leveraging on the favourable geographical advantages, the polyester thin film business will achieve better development.

during the year under review, expenditures involved the payment for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, expenditure on construction in progress and payment for interests in leasehold land held for own use under operating lease in our investing activities amounted to rmb448,658,000, resulting in net current liabilities of rmb420,204,000 as at 31 december 2015. such investments in the plants and equipment of the group will further expand our corporate scale and generate a larger net cash flow from our future operation, which in turn will bring better returns for our shareholders in the long run. in addition, the group s debt-to-equity ratio (calculated by dividing total assets by total liabilities) was 2.4 times, and the overall liabilities remained at a stable level.
