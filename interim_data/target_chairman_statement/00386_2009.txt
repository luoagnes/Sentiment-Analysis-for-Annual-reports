chairman s statement
first of all, on behalf of the board of directors of sinopec corp., i would like to express our sincere gratitude to all shareholders as well as the public for your care and support.
in 2008, international oil prices experienced drastic increase and sharp fall, while domestic prices for refined oil products were under tight control. demand for refined oil products plunged after experienced a high growth level, and both the demand and prices of petrochemical products plummeted harshly.
since july 2008, the international financial crisis has extended quickly to the real economy.
challenged by the unpreceding changes, sinopec corp. proactively adjusted its business strategies and capitalised on its strengths in exploration and production, its competitive positioning in refining, chemicals business and sales, and its advantageous position in its international trading business to secure and optimise resources. sinopec corp. has benefited from the parent company s complementary strengths in petroleum and petrochemical engineering services, and its international strategy to go global . this has allowed the company to make solid advances through precision management, capturing potential and improving efficiency, promoting technology renovation, strengthening workplace safety, saving energy and reducing emissions. the output of oil and natural gas is on steady rise, and profit increases significantly. the company promptly adjusted its refining and chemical production in line with the shifting market demand. because of the strict control on the refined oil products prices, refining business suffered huge losses. chemical business also recorded red in the fourth quarter due to the falling demand and prices of chemical products in the international market. however, i am glad to see that, with years of dedication on improving the marketing network, the sales volume of refined oil products rises steadily, marketing structure is fine-tuned, and the profit marks constant growth. the strategy of centralised marketing of petrochemical products, after several years of reform, has begun to take effects and strengthen our capability to defend market risks. in the first three quarters of last year, the company actively responded to a domestic shortage of oil products and tightening controls over price by the government by safeguarding supplies, especially during periods of disaster relief, busy farming season, and the beijing olympic games, and, as a result, benefitted the consumers and made significant contribution to sustain the steady and rapid social and economic development in china. supported by management and employees, in the year of 2008, the company accumulated valuable experience for future business operations and development by actively responding to severe in 2008, under the prc accounting standards for business enterprises ( asbe ), our operating income amounted to rmb 1.4521 trillion, representing an increase of 20.5% over 2007. net profit attributed to equity shareholders of the company was rmb 29.69 billion, representing a decrease by 47.5% over previous year. under international financial reporting standards ( ifrs ), profit for the period attributed to equity shareholders of the company was rmb 29.77 billion, down by 47.3% compared to 2007. considering the company s earnings level, future development, and shareholders interests, the board of directors has recommended a full year dividend of rmb0.12 per share for the year of 2008.
excluding the interim dividend of rmb 0.03 per share, the final dividend for 2008 is rmb 0.09 in respect of the past three years , china s economy has maintained rapid growth and the demand for energy and petrochemical products has increased signifcantly, which provided a favorable environment for the company s development. however, because international crude oil prices rose significantly and the control over domestic oil products prices were tightened, the refining business suffered huge losses for a long period. facing both opportunities and challenges, the board of directors adhered to the scientific approach of development, adopted the guidelines of reform, adjustment, management, innovation, and development, and consistently implemented the strategies of integrating and globalising resources and markets. at the same time, we carefully carried out government s pricing mechanism on refined oil products, attached great importance to the corporate social responsibilities, and made all efforts to ensure the oil products supply. the board of directors of this term also actively communicated with relevant government authorities to win the policy support that helped improve the company s operational performance. over the past three years, we have made remarkable advances on corporate governance, development, reforms and adjustments as well as scientific and technological innovations.
sinopec corp. is committed to improving corporate governance. we have completed the a share reform to conform the interests of all shareholders. to meet regulatory requirements and the company s development, we performed a series of specific activities to enhance corporate governance. we implemented and improved the system of independent directors and specialised committees, which provided support for scientific decision making by the board of directors. this term of board of directors continued to strengthen our internal control through annual review and enhanced risk control and improved management level.
