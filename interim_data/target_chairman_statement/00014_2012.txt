my special thanks to dr. deanna ruth tak yung rudgard who stepped down from the board last may, after having served the board for over 18 years. we are grateful for her guidance and the wise counsel she provided to the board throughout the years.
hysan has made enormous progress this year. on behalf of the board, i would like to thank our management team and staff for their contribution and hard work.

the local economy is not immune to the impact of the global economic uncertainties. however, hong kong s economic fundamentals are expected to remain sound. the overall retail market is expected to remain resilient and should benefit our retail leasing business. tight supply of new grade a office space in core locations should provide support to our office leasing business. in this light, hysan s more balanced core office and retail portfolio should look forward to continuing steady performance in 2012.
the launch of hysan place at the northern gateway of our hub is strategic to the group s long-term growth. it is being followed by the rejuvenation of the lee theatre plaza hub at our western gateway, adding long-term competitiveness to our portfolio. by creating a new destination and new surroundings in causeway bay, we will continue to contribute to the further transformation of an energetic and unique district.
