dr the honourable lee shau kee, gbm chairman and managing director
the cooling measures imposed by the government, as well as growing concerns over the tapering of the quantitative easing monetary policies in the united states, led to a stagnant property market in hong kong in the first quarter of 2014. however, the government revised the terms of double stamp duty in may 2014, allowing more time for second-home buyers to sell their original properties. external economic conditions also stabilised and the property market became active. in response to the improving market sentiment, the group launched new projects almost every month in the second half of the year.
development projects which were launched during the year to a positive response included double cove starview and double cove starview prime in ma on shan (phases 2 and 3 of double cove ), metro6 in hung hom, h" bonaire in ap lei chau, as well as high one grand and high one in cheung sha wan.
meanwhile, double cove phase 1, 39 conduit road at mid-levels, the reach in yuen long, green code in fanling, as well as an array of urban redevelopment boutique residences under the h collection , were also re-launched for sale. over 93% and 54% of the respective units at double cove starview and double cove starview prime had been snapped up at the end of 2014. for the year ended 31 december 2014, the group sold an attributable total amount of hk$11,692 million of hong office and industrial developments, including e-trade plaza in chai wan, global trade square in wong chuk hang and global gateway tower in cheung sha wan, were also put up for sale, whilst the shops at centrestage and plover cove garden were disposed of during the year. attributable proceeds arising from the disposals of these industrialcommercial developments and shops totalled hk$2,234 million. including the aforesaid residential sales revenue, the group sold hk$13,926 million worth of hong kong properties in attributable terms during the year under review.

the group has made use of multiple channels to replenish its development landbank in hong kong. purely through redevelopment of old tenement buildings in urban areas (excluding conversion of new territories land, as well as public auction and tender), abundant land resources have been available to the group for property development. together with the development projects which are sourced from land-use conversion of new territories land and public tenders (with the exception of a few projects earmarked for rental purposes), sizeable areas will be available to the group for property sales in the coming years (with details shown as follows).
(table 1) unsold units from the major development projects offered for sale there are 20 development projects available for sale: (table 2) projects pending sale in 2015 in the absence of unforeseen delays, the following projects will be available for sale in 2015: (table 3) existing urban redevelopment projects the group has a total of 5 existing projects under planning for redevelopment or land-use conversion and the dates of their sales launch are not yet fixed. as outlined below, they are expected to provide about 1.3 million square feet in attributable gross floor area in the urban areas based on the government s latest city planning: (table 4) newly-acquired urban redevelopment projects ownership fully consolidated there are 13 newly-acquired urban redevelopment projects with ownership fully consolidated and in the absence of unforeseen delays, most of these projects are expected to be available for sale in 2016-2017. their expected attributable gross floor areas, based on the government s latest city planning, are as follows: (table 5) newly-acquired urban redevelopment projects with over 80% ownership secured there are 27 newly-acquired urban redevelopment projects with over 80% ownership acquired and their ownership will be consolidated by proceeding to the court for compulsory sale under the land (compulsory sale for redevelopment) ordinance . in the event that no court order is granted, the group may not be able to complete the consolidation of the ownership for development. if legal procedures go smoothly and in the absence of unforeseen delays, most of the projects set out below are expected to be available for sale in 2017-2019.
on the basis of the government s latest city planning, the expected gross floor areas are shown as follows: (table 6) newly-acquired urban redevelopment projects with over 20% but less than 80% ownership secured the group has other acquisitions in progress, involving 40 projects located in prime urban areas in hong kong and kowloon. currently, ownership of each project ranging from between 20% and 80% has been achieved. the attributable land area of these projects totals about 300,000 square feet. if and when their ownerships are successfully consolidated, based on the government s latest city planning, the total estimated attributable gross floor area would be about 2,740,000 square feet upon completion of redevelopment. based on the respective ownership currently secured by the group for each project, the total pro-rata attributable gross floor area is about 1,260,000 successful acquisitions of the above projects bear uncertainty. the group may not be able to consolidate ownerships of all projects.
redevelopments can only be implemented upon acquisition of the full ownership of the relevant projects.

in september 2014, the following commercial site in tsim sha tsui shopping area with easy access to an mtr station and stunning views of victoria harbour was acquired through public tender at the consideration of hk$4,688 million. it is planned to be developed into a ginza-style commercial project, giving an added boost to the group s investment property portfolio: in respect of residential sites, the group has chosen to replenish its land bank by acquiring old tenement buildings for redevelopment and applying for land-use conversion for its portfolio of new territories land, instead of bidding for land at high prices through public auctions or tenders. although this method of land banking may involve a relatively longer period of time to accomplish as compared to that of public tenders, it ensures a more reliable source of land supply with a lower acquisition cost, which is beneficial to the group s development returns in the long term. to date, a total of 12 urban redevelopment residences had been put up for sales, providing 1,290 housing units with a total attributable gross floor area of 1.1 million square feet.
the urban redevelopment project of high one at cheung sha wan, which was launched for sale recently, is a manifest example.
in terms of saleable area, the average selling price for the units sold for this project is about hk$17,000 per square foot, whereas the acquisition cost of the land site was about hk$4,400 per square foot (excluding construction cost and other expenses). as for double cove starview prime (double cove phase 3) at ma on shan, which was sourced from land-use conversion, the average selling price for the units sold stands at about hk$13,000 per square foot, whereas its acquisition cost (including the cost for acquisition of new territories land and the land conversion premium) was merely hk$3,650 per square foot (excluding construction cost and other expenses). hence, it is evident that profit contributions from urban redevelopment projects as well as new territories projects are the group currently has a land bank in hong kong comprising a total attributable gross floor area of approximately 23.8 million square feet, made up as follows: land in urban areas as aforesaid, there are currently 40 urban redevelopment projects of old tenement buildings with entire or over 80% ownership acquired, representing a total attributable gross floor area of about 3.4 million square feet, which should be ready for sale or leasing in 2016 or beyond. the total land cost of such projects is estimated to be about hk$21,500 million (inclusive of street shops and the project at the prestigious seymour road in mid-levels being both of relatively high value), translating into a land cost of approximately hk$6,300 per square foot of gross floor area.
during the year, the group completed the acquisition of the entire interest in the queen s road west project in western district, king s road project in quarry bay, as well as kok cheung street project and ka shin street project in tai kok tsui, providing a total commercial and residential gross floor area of about 830,000 in addition to the acquisition of redevelopment projects, the group regularly evaluates its own properties for conversion into other uses so as to meet the evolving market demand and ensure efficient use of land resources. during the year under review, three industrial buildings (namely, well tech centre in san po kong, dragon centre in cheung sha wan, big star centre in kowloon bay) with a total gross floor area of about 510,000 square feet were approved by the government to be reconfigured for office use, free of any land-use conversion premium under the revitalization policy. as for the industrial site at king wah road, north point, it is planned to be redeveloped into an office building pending an appeal to the government on the amount of assessed new territories land at the end of december 2014, the group held new territories land reserves amounting to approximately 44.5 million square feet in land area, which was the largest holding among all property developers in hong kong.
in july 2013, the government announced the result of the north east new territories new development areas planning and engineering study , of which kwu tung north and fanling north would be treated as the extension of fanlingsheung shui new town. the government has also decided to adopt an enhanced conventional new town approach and, subject to specified criteria, private land owners are allowed to apply for in-situ land exchange for private developments. outline zoning plans for both kwu tung north and fanling north were already published in the gazette in december 2013. of the group s land holding of 2.8 million square feet in these areas, a total land area of roughly over 800,000 square feet is assessed to be eligible for in-situ land exchange and the government may resume the other parts of its lands for public use through cash compensation. the group has earlier applied for in-situ land exchange for two land lots in fanling north and kwu tung. they are expected to provide total developable gross floor areas of approximately 3,730,000 square feet and 270,000 square feet respectively, against their respective site areas of 787,000 square feet and 45,000 square feet. developable areas for both sites are subject to finalization of land premium.
according to the aforementioned north east new territories new development areas planning and engineering study , the region at ping cheta kwu ling will be re-planned, in response to the 2013 policy address which put forward an initiative to review the development potential of new territories north, including new opportunities brought about by the new railway infrastructure. in january 2014, the government commenced its preliminary feasibility study on developing the new territories north on a study area of about 5,300 hectares. in order to increase the land supply for housing, during the period the government formulated the preliminary outline development plan for planning and engineering study for housing sites in yuen long south investigation and launched its stage 2 community engagement. it also released the land use review for kam tin south and pat heung . the group holds certain pieces of land in these study areas.
for hung shui kiu new development area planning and engineering study , stage 3 community engagement was launched in the second half of 2014 so as to allow the public to discuss the recommended outline development plan. the group holds a total site area of 5.5 million square feet in hung shui kiu new development area, which covers an area of approximately 826 hectares. under the preliminary outline development plan, it was proposed to accommodate a new town of a population comprising about 218,000 and about 60,000 additional flats, of which about 50% are private developments. the government is now gauging the public s views and has expressed no view on the issues of land resumption or in-situ land exchange in that region. impacts to the group arising from these proposals are yet to be seen. the group will continue to work in line with the government s development policies and follow up closely on its during the year under review, the group s attributable gross rental income in hong kong, including the attributable contribution from subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, increased by 7% to hk$6,424 million. the attributable pre-tax net rental income, including the attributable contribution from subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, was hk$4,892 million, representing a growth of 8% over the previous year. included therein is attributable gross rental income of hk$1,812 million (2013: hk$1,711 million) contributed from the group s attributable interest of 40.76% in the international finance centre ( ifc ) project. at the end of december 2014, the leasing rate for the group s core rental properties was 98%. besides, the group held more than 10,000 car parking bays, providing additional rental income.
at the year end, the group held a total attributable gross floor area of approximately 8.9 million square feet of completed investment properties of excellent quality in hong kong: in 2014, the value of total retail sales in hong kong decreased by 0.2% due to slackening in visitor spending and the lacklustre local consumption. despite these headwinds, all of the group s major shopping malls, except those under renovation or re-alignment of tenant mix, recorded nearly full occupancy at the end of december 2014. this was mainly due to the group s various efforts and initiatives to attract shoppers so as to boost tenants business. in order to maintain the group s competitiveness, renovation work is now underway for certain regional shopping malls, namely, sunshine city plaza in ma on shan, metro city plaza ii in tseung kwan o, citimall in yuen long and city landmark i in tsuen wan.
in order to improve the rental values and appeal to discerning tenants, the group regularly improves the quality of its office developments and enhances their green features. during the year under review, aia tower in north point achieved the highest platinum rating under the hong kong building environmental assessment method ( beam ) scheme. together with ifc in central, as well as golden centre (which were both earlier accredited with platinum ratings) and fwd financial centre (whose facility upgrades are in progress) both in sheung wan, the group s office developments in hong kong island have all performed well. the group s portfolio of office and industrialoffice premises in kowloon east, including manulife financial centre , aia financial centre , 78 hung to road and bamboos centre , also recorded increased rents with the leasing performance of the group s luxury residences, namely eva court and 39 conduit road , as well as the serviced suites at four seasons place was satisfactory. mira moon , the 91-room designer lifestyle hotel operated by miramar hotel and investment company, limited since its opening in november 2013, also performed well during the year under review.

in the first half of 2014, the property sales volume continued to decline as a result of the then existing restrictions on home purchases and mortgage lending imposed by the central government. the downturn of the property market caused repeated postponements and cancellations of land auctions. after the meetings of the national people s congress and chinese people s political consultative conference in march of 2014, the five central measures , intended to speed up the granting of home loans for first-time purchasers and to set mortgage rates at reasonable levels, were introduced and the deposit reserve ratio was reduced as part of the credit easing policies to satisfy mortgage demand amongst home buyers. in the latter half of the year, the central government continued to relax the restrictions on credit and the announcement of further relaxations on 30 september 2014 emerged as the turning point of the property market. at the same time, the local governments also adopted various stimulus measures for the property market. benchmark loan and deposit interest rates were subsequently cut by the people s bank of china.

hil will also follow up closely on the development of the arbitration case and continue to pursue further negotiations with the relevant prc authority with a view to achieving a settlement relating to the toll fee collection right of hangzhou qianjiang third bridge that is in the interests of hil and its shareholders as a whole.

improvement in the us economy, as well as increased global liquidity following the launch of quantitative easing by europe and japan, lent support to the property market in hong kong. in view of notable revival in property market, particularly in respect of the small and medium-sized residential units, the hong kong monetary authority has recently introduced a new round of tightening measures for property mortgages. the group believes that these measures should be conducive to the healthy and sustainable development of the hong kong property market in the long run.
as regards property sales , the group s efforts in urban redevelopment over the years have started to bear fruit. in 2015, the group plans to embark on sales launches of 7 urban residential development projects, as well as phases 4 and 5 of double cove in ma on shan, so as to meet the prevailing keen market demand for small and medium-sized flats. together with the completed stock, a total of about 3,200 residential units in hong kong is estimated to be available for sale this year.
the group has made use of multiple channels to replenish its development landbank in hong kong. there are currently 40 urban redevelopment projects with 80% to 100% of their ownership acquired, representing about 3.4 million square feet in total attributable gross floor area, which is expected to be available for sale or leasing in 2016 or beyond. the group has also increased its land reserve in the new territories to 44.5 million square feet, the largest holding among its peers in hong kong. meanwhile, following the previous success in acquiring a residential site in fanling through public tender, the group has won the tender again for the commercial site atop the tsim sha tsui east mtr station at hk$4,688 million during the year under review. it is by diversified means of land acquisitions that a stable supply of land is provided to the group for property development in the long run.
turning to mainland china, money supply should be relatively relaxed to maintain economic growth. in the first-tier cities, demand for housing is still strong and outlook of the property market remains relatively optimistic. in the second-tier cities, the diversity in the development of the property market will further intensify. the group will actively look for quality projects in the first-tier cities as well as residential development projects in the second-tier cities exhibiting great potential. also, the group will step up its co-operation with mainland property developers.
as regards rental business , the group held a total attributable gross floor area of approximately 8.9 million square feet in completed investment properties in hong kong with most of them being quality offices and large-scale shopping malls, plus approximately 7.3 million square feet of completed investment properties across the prime cities in mainland china. in addition, the group has many commercial development projects in the pipeline. with a continually expanding rental portfolio, the group s rental income is set to report further growth.
the associates , namely, hong kong and china gas, miramar and hong kong ferry continue to provide the group with a source of stable and sizeable income. hong kong and china gas, in particular, is hong kong s first public utility company. it has 202 projects on the mainland, spreading across 24 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities with the number of customers in hong kong and mainland china increased to approximately 20.8 million. its business coverage has also extended to new energy and water sectors. its returns are promising given its sizeable customer base in both hong kong and mainland china amid rapidly growing business development.
the above three major income pillars (namely, property sales , rental business and associates ) produce stable income for the group. as at the end of february 2015, revenue from the pre-sales of hong kong properties, but not yet accounted for, amounted to approximately hk$6,526 million in attributable terms.
together with a strong balance sheet, the group is well placed to seize emerging opportunities to expand its asset portfolio, creating abundant value for the shareholders. barring unforeseen circumstances, the group s performance in the coming financial year is expected to be satisfactory.

i would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to my fellow directors for their wise counsel, and to thank all our staff for their dedication and hard work.
