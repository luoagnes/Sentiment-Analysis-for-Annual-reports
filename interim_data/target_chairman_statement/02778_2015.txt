he total rental income of champion reit for 2014 increased 4.6% to hk$2,080 million.
while rental income at citibank plaza fell 3.7% to hk$1,064 million because of the departure of a major tenant at the end of the third quarter, the strong performance of langham place was enough to offset the decline; the combined office and shopping mall rental income of langham place rose by 14.9% to hk$1,016 million.
net property operating expenses rose 16% to hk$280 million, primarily due to higher leasing commissions at citibank plaza and an increase in net building management expenses at langham place mall. net property income improved by 3.0% over the previous year, to hk$1,800 million. profit after tax decreased from hk$2,199 million in 2013 to hk$1,929 million, mainly due to lower revaluation gains of only hk$890 million as compared to hk$1,117 million for 2013.
excluding revaluation gains and other items that are non-cash in nature from the year s accounting profit, distributable income decreased 2.9% to hk$1,234 million. distributable income was lower this year despite the better net property income because of higher financing costs and higher taxation. interest expenses increased hk$37 million from a higher average interest rate after the hk$7.5 billion refinancing of bank loans in the middle of the year and because of incremental financing costs associated with the acquisition of additional floors at citibank plaza in 2013. there was also a hk$48 million increase in taxes payable in the absence of one- off tax deductions in the second half of 2014. after retention of hk$63 million, the distribution amount is hk$1,171 million. distribution per unit ( dpu ) for the second half of the year is hk$0.0998. combined with the hk$0.1039 paid out for the first half, the total dpu for 2014 is hk$0.2037, a decrease of 3.0% compared to 2013.
the appraised value of the reit s properties at year-end 2014 was hk$62,438 million compared to hk$61,509 million as of 31 december 2013. as a result, net asset value per unit increased to hk$8.06 from hk$7.94 a year ago.
as no additional debt was incurred during the year, there was also a corresponding decrease in gearing ratio from 23.4% to 23.1%.
in 2015, we are expecting sustained income growth at langham place.
it will nonetheless be insufficient to compensate for the lower income at citibank plaza. there should be a weakening in total rental income as it will take time for the income from reletting at citibank plaza to be fully realised. therefore, dpu is most likely to be lower in 2015 before recovering in 2016. we will continue to actively manage our two trophy assets to maximize rental income over the long term.
