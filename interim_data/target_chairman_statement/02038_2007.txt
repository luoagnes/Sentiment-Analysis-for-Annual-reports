much of the industry s growth was from emerging markets. with the favored trend of being close to the customers , we too have focused our expansion in these markets. we have significantly expanded our operations and capacity with establishment of additional sites in brazil, india and mexico. for the brazil and india sites, shipments to customers commenced in 2006 while shipments for the mexico site will commence in the first quarter of 2007. due to growth of the subscriber base, we anticipate significant increased activities in these countries.

china continues to be a very large sales territory, as well as a strategic operations site for all of our customers. since our key manufacturing site in shenzhen has reached its growth limit, we turned to northern china for further expansion. we have commenced huge construction projects in langfang and taiyuan, areas which provide both efficient logistics and cost competitiveness for our customers in beijing and tianjian. with these investments, we believe fih will have sufficient capacity to accommodate our growth for the upcoming years.

we have continued our focus on operational excellence for all of our sites and have implemented lean manufacturing and fps (foxconn production system). these improvement processes along with our never ending efforts in tight cost control helped maintain an enviable cost structure. coupled with the value added vertically integrated services, shortest component supply chain, early involvement in product development, and global ramp-up capabilities in tooling and production, we were able to maintain a reasonable profit level and provide a good return to our shareholders.
