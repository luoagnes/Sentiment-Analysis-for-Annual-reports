capitalizing on the development opportunities
arising from the home improvement and furnishings

home furnishing is closely related with peoples daily life and standard of living. along with the growth in disposable income, peoples enhanced standard of living and higher requirement in quality life, the home furnishing market in china has experienced a rapid development in the past five years.
according to the independent authoritative market research institutions, in 2016, the total retail sales of chinas home improvement and furnishings industry reached a high level of nearly rmb4 trillion; however, when it comes to per capita consumption, there is still an obvious gap between china and developed countries, such as the united states and the united kingdom. along with the continued steady growth in chinas macro economy and peoples constantly enhanced taste and requirement in living, the home improvement and furnishings industry has entered into a 10-year golden period, and will grow rapidly at a pace faster than that of gdp growth in the coming five years.
consolidating our leading position in the home
improvement and furnishings industry
according to the independent authoritative market research institutions, we are a nationwide home improvement and furnishings shopping mall operator in china which ranks fi rst in terms of area of operational premises, the number of malls, the geographic coverage, and with the most relevant market share in chinas rapidly growing home improvement and furnishings retail industry. as at the end of the reporting period, we have operated 200 shopping malls in mainland china with a total operating area of more than 12.7 million sq.m.. however, compared with the home furnishing markets in united states and other developed countries, the market concentration of home furnishings industry in mainland china is signifi cantly lower. as one of the most infl uential home furnishings enterprises in mainland china, we not only have absolute market superiority, but also have great room for growth and integration potential.
building a new benchmark retailer in the home
improvement and furnishings industry
in order to build the group into a new benchmark retailer in the home improvement and furnishings industry, we will continue to expand our business scale through applying the two-pronged development model of portfolio shopping malls and managed shopping malls, and place emphasis on enhancing our enterprise brand, connotation and value.
a new retailing model, in my opinion, is supposed to provide consumers with better and more intensive experience, more professional and comprehensive value-added services and more convenient and user-friendly modes of service, as compared with the traditional one. goods circulated in the home improvement and furnishings industry are usually non-standard (customized) goods with high unit price and high degree of specialization, and thus higher requirements in shopping guide service, the quality and eco-friendly attributes of products, the distribution, installation and after-sale services are imposed by consumers. as one of the most infl uential home furnishings enterprises in mainland china, we have always been committed, with a view to truly understanding and serving the demands from consumers, to providing consumers with a reliable circulation platform which may integrate suffi cient home improvement and furnishings industry brands, providing professional shopping guide service and in-depth experience service, assuring the quality and ecofriendly attributes of products circulated on the platform, and offering reliable distribution, installation and after-sale services. meanwhile, we gradually expanded the application of the internet-related products and services in home improvement and furnishings business on the basis of our physical shopping malls network, including introducing online shopping malls, online home decoration, consumer fi nancing and other expanding businesses, so as to address diversifi ed demands of consumers in an integrated and close-loop manner and enhance the integrated o2o experience of consumers. all these measures are adopted to make our omni-channel circulation platform the most valuable one in the home improvement and furnishings industry.
promoting a well-grounded and forward-looking
development to lead the industry in its evolvement
nowadays, the world has entered into a digital era, and the level of digitalization determines the long-term competitiveness of an enterprise or institution, home improvement and furnishings industry is of no exception. the group is implementing a 1001 strategy, which is designed to enhance the groups long-term competitiveness and embrace new development opportunities by virtue of internet, big data, cloud computing and other information technologies. household intelligentization is another signifi cant development trend of the home improvement and furnishings industry. at the same time, the group is also seeking opportunities to tap into the smart household fi eld, as a breakthrough point to embrace future in a proactive manner. in addition, we will also actively explore new business models, attempt asset securitization in respect of properties of portfolio shopping malls and deeply integrate upstream and downstream resources via investments and mergers and acquisitions, in an effort to expand the business scale, reinforce the strength of the group, and to lead the industry in its evolvement.
the achievements made by the company were refl ective of the efforts of all individuals of red star macalline. i would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude, on behalf of the board, to all staff for their hard work and all shareholders and stakeholders for giving us trust and confi dence. in the coming year, we will consistently adhere to the spirit of craftsman to improve ourselves as well as promote our national living quality and spread culture of furnishings through diligence and care in the home improvement and furnishings industry, and to gain more returns to our shareholders.
