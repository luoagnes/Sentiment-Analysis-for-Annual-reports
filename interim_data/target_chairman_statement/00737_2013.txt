chairman s statement i am pleased to report the group s results for the financial year ended 30 june 2013. the group s net toll revenue fell by approximately 7% to rmb1,803 million during the year under review, compared to the previous year. this was mainly due to a year-on-year decline of approximately 13% in the toll revenue of the gs superhighway following the implementation of the guangdong province toll roads special clean-up implementation proposal ( tariff proposal ) in june 2012 and the holiday toll-free policy. however, that decline was partly offset by strong growth in the toll revenue of phase ii west and the new revenue contribution from phase iii west, which opened on 25 january 2013.
the group s net profit from its toll road projects decreased by 28% from rmb809 million to rmb581 million. meanwhile, the profit attributable to owners of the company declined by 28%, from rmb836 million to rmb601 million. basic earnings per share for the year decreased by 30% from the previous year s hk34.55 cents (equivalent to rmb28.23 cents) to rmb19.75 cents.
final dividend and special final dividend the board has proposed a final dividend of rmb9 cents (equivalent to hk11.3122 cents at the exchange rate of rmb1:hk$1.25691) per share plus a special final dividend of rmb10 cents (equivalent to hk12.5691 cents at the exchange rate of rmb1:hk$1.25691) per share for the year ended 30 june 2013. together with an interim dividend of rmb10 cents per share that has already been paid, the total dividends for the year will amount to rmb29 cents per share. this represents an increase of 5% on the last financial year s total dividends of hk34 cents (equivalent to approximately rmb28 cents) per share. excluding the special final dividend of rmb10 cents per share, the company s total dividends for this year represents a payout ratio of 97% of the company s profit attributable to owners of the company and will be 1% lower than that of the previous year.

the group s proportionate share of the aggregate net toll revenue of its expressway projects for the year ended 30 june 2013 fell by approximately 7% year-on-year, from rmb1,949 million to financial year 2012 2013 % change gs superhighway (at jv company level) average daily traffic (no. of vehicles 000) 402 427 +6% average daily toll revenue (rmb 000) 9,910 8,651 13% phase i west (at jv company level) average daily traffic (no. of vehicles 000) 38 42 +13% average daily toll revenue (rmb 000) 435 453 +4% phase ii west (at jv company level) average daily traffic (no. of vehicles 000) 61 79 +30% average daily toll revenue (rmb 000) 1,028 1,303 +27% phase iii west (at jv company level) average daily traffic (no. of vehicles 000) 14* na average daily toll revenue (rmb 000) 291* na * phase iii west opened on 25 january 2013. average daily figures are based on the period from 25 january 2013 to 30 june 2013.
in accordance with the group s financing strategy and against the backdrop of credit-tightening in the prc, the group raised a total of rmb1.98 billion by issuing two tranches of rmb corporate bonds in july 2010 and may 2011 respectively. most of the proceeds from these corporate bonds were used to finance the development of phase iii west and for interim financing of phase ii west. the first tranche of corporate bonds, valued at rmb1.38 billion, matured on 13 july 2012. the second tranche, valued at rmb600 million, will mature on 18 may 2014. in may 2012, the company obtained a term loan facility in an aggregate amount of rmb1,000 million and a revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of rmb600 million for a tenure of three years for the repayment of the first tranche of rmb1.38 billion corporate bonds and for the group s general working capital. in october 2012, the company placed 120 million rmb-traded shares on the stock exchange, the net proceeds from which were approximately rmb375 million. these are being used for the group s general working capital.
in june 2013, the group obtained a further revolving loan facility for hk$200 million and a term loan facility for hk$100 million to finance its general working capital requirements.
as at 30 june 2013, the group s bank balances and cash on hand (excluding jv companies) amounted to rmb1,480 million, nearly all of this was denominated in rmb. the group s net cash on hand (excluding jv companies) amounted to rmb278 million after netting off the company s rmb corporate bonds and the group s bank loans. most of the group s cash is placed in deposits denominated in rmb in order to earn higher interest income. the group will continue to strengthen its treasury management and evaluate the options available for it to improve the yields on its substantial cash deposit portfolio.
most of the group s cash inflow for the year was derived from dividends received from the gs superhighway jv, whereas its major cash outflow was the payment of dividends to the company s shareholders. the group will continue to optimise its balance sheet, improve its cash flow and strengthen its financial position.

during the year under review, the low interest rate environment continued to support the global economic recovery and stabilise financial markets. however, progress remained slow in restoring the global economy to sustainable growth. whereas the world s other leading economies shrank or remained stagnant, china continued to be the main contributor to global gdp growth. china s gdp grew by a steady 7.8% in 2012, in line with the government s target growth rate; and its total trade volume continued to rise to a historical high level. china remained the world s largest market for the sale of domestic vehicles for the fourth consecutive year. according to the media, more than one million vehicles were newly registered in guangdong province during 2012. the national car sale market showed signs of regaining its growth momentum, increasing by 12% with more than 10 million vehicles sold in the first half of 2013. these factors will enhance the economic momentum of the prc and guangdong province in particular, and they will in turn benefit the group s expressways.
the group s proportionate share of the aggregate net toll revenue of its expressway projects fell by approximately 7% year-on-year to rmb1,803 million. this was mainly due to a decline in the toll revenue of the gs superhighway of approximately 13% year-on-year since the implementation of the tariff proposal and holiday toll-free policy. however, that was partly offset by the strong growth of phase ii west s toll revenue and the expanded revenue base, which now includes phase iii west.
the group s aggregate ebit of toll expressways (excluding an exchange gain on the gs superhighway jv s us dollar and hk dollar loans and related income tax expenses) declined by 18% year-on-year, from rmb1,333 million to rmb1,092 million.
during the year under review, the aggregate average daily traffic volume on the gs superhighway and the western delta route increased by about 12% to 561,000 vehicles year-on-year, while their aggregate average daily toll revenue decreased by about 6% to rmb10.7 million. the overall toll revenue of the two expressways decreased from rmb4,163 million to rmb3,844 million during the year, mainly due to the fall in the toll revenue of the gs superhighway. however, the impact of the tariff proposal on the gs superhighway stabilised within two months since its implementation. after an initial drop, the average daily toll revenue picked up from rmb8.3 million in june 2012 to around rmb9 million in june 2013, despite the subsequent implementation of holiday toll-free policy. in june 2013, a year after the tariff proposal and holiday toll-free policy s implementation, both the average daily toll revenue and average daily traffic volume of the gs superhighway started to grow again by 8% year-on-year. on the other hand, not only holiday toll-free policy had slight impact on phase i west and phase ii west, the tariff proposal s impact was insignificant as both of them have been implementing the new tariff since they opened.
phase i west recorded stable growth and phase ii west maintained strong growth during the year under review. traffic on phase i west has rebounded since the lifting of restriction measures at yajisha bridge in december 2011. the average daily toll revenue of phase ii west has exceeded rmb1.4 million since january 2013 (except during the months when the holiday toll-free policy was in force). in july 2013, phase ii west achieved its profit breakeven target of an average daily toll revenue of rmb1.5 million for the first time.
phase iii west commenced operation on 25 january 2013, thus extending the group s toll revenue base. completion of all three phases of the western delta route has added fresh momentum to the growth of its toll revenue and traffic and created synergy among phase i west, phase ii west and phase iii west. the traffic and toll revenue of phase iii west reached 18,000 vehicles and rmb376,000 in july 2013. the group expects that phase iii west may achieve cash flow breakeven (when its average daily toll revenue reaches rmb850,000) within the next two years.

despite the slow pace of the global economy s recovery, the gdp of china and guangdong grew by 7.6% and 8.5% respectively in the first half of 2013. the prc central government currently targets a gdp growth of over 7% for 2013 to maintain labour market stability. the national car sales volume maintained its growth momentum during the first half of 2013. according to the latest statistics, car sales increased by 12%, with over 10 million vehicles sold in the first half of 2013. class 1 small car traffic in guangdong continued to increase, due to the continuous increase of passenger car sales.
the toll revenue of the gs superhighway has been rebounding since the implementation of the tariff proposal and holiday toll-free policy, and there is still room for further growth in its traffic.
according to the latest media reports, the entire coastal expressway will be completed by the end of september 2013. the group will continue to monitor the expressway s progress. at the same time, the group believes the gs superhighway will remain competitive.
the opening of phase iii west marks the completion of the entire western delta route, which has become the main artery of a regional expressway network that covers the most prosperous cities on the prd s western bank, including guangzhou, foshan, zhongshan and zhuhai. it will also offer direct access to the hengqin state-level strategic new zone, macau and hong kong via its connection with the hzm bridge, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2016.
hengqin in zhuhai has become china s third state-level strategic new zone and is being positioned as a new growth hub focusing on the development of business services, tourism, technological research and the cultural sector. preferential treatment has been put in place in its free trade zone to attract investment, and numerous key development projects, including commercial landmarks, hotels and tourist attractions, will be completed in the coming few years. the western delta route will thus benefit from the increase in passenger flows and demand for transportation brought about by the development of zhuhai as well as the closer economic integration among cities in the prd region.
the company was the first listed company in the world to offer both rmb-traded shares and hkd- traded shares under the dual tranche, dual counter model. this has increased the average daily trading volume of the company s shares and broadened its shareholder base. in addition, it helps to increase the group s funding sources and its ability to raise long-term capital in rmb, thus benefitting the development of the group s prc projects. the group will continue to explore various financing and investment options as they become available as a result of rmb s internationalisation.
