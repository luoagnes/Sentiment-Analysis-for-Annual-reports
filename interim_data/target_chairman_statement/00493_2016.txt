the current conditions and challenges mainly comprise three aspects. firstly, the prc economy is undergoing an in-depth reform, and the retail sector increasingly faces overcapacity and a severe shortage of product differentiation. the diminishing market demand dampens consumer purchasing power. on the other hand, some commodities lack competitiveness and severely lack product differentiation, as a result, inventories are piling up. this is one of the reasons for the supply side reforms advocated by the prc government.
secondly, the rapid advancement of the internet is transforming people s lifestyle and consumption habits. under pressure from the competition of the e-commerce and inspire by the new technologies, the traditional retail industry is in the midst of a dramatic transition. where previously retailers with a large traditional network had the edge, now increasingly retailers with the ability to effectively link up with customers are winning out. thirdly, with challenges brought by new technologies and new concepts, it is so critical for retailers to possess the capability of self-advancement and adopt new technologies for satisfying customers endless demands for consumption. innovative technologies should be considered in a long-term perspective and with minds opened. integrating such new technologies into the retail sector will enable us to create a better consumption experience and causing the traditional retail industry to upgrade and evolve.
