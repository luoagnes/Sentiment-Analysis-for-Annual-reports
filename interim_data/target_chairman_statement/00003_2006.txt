business development in
the group s business on the mainland is now entering a new stage of diversification. the group continues to focus on natural gas and expand its city piped gas and other energy-related businesses. after years of expansion and operation, the group s gas business is now wellestablished.
using this as a role model, the group successfully entered the mainland s water supply and wastewater business in 2005.
involvement in yet another utility sector has further extended the scope of the group s investments on in early 2006, the group signed an agreement for establishing a joint venture piped gas project in xian, shaanxi province. this will be the group s largest gas investment project on the mainland to date and lays a foundation for the group s future move into northwestern china, a huge market noted for its rapid economic growth. the group now has city piped gas joint venture projects in 31 mainland cities across guangdong, eastern china, shandong, central china, northern china, northeastern china and western china. to tie in with the arrival of natural gas, the group s various joint venture projects in shandong, eastern china and central china including weihai, changzhou, yixing, wujiang, maanshan, huzhou and wuhan have now fully converted to natural gas. to be in line with the arrival of natural gas in the near future, several joint venture projects in guangdong province will commence conversion work in the second half of this year. as the availability of natural gas will greatly boost gas consumption, these joint ventures are poised to enter a thriving period for their business development.
besides city piped gas projects, the group continues to develop other energy-related businesses. it is participating in the investment and operation of high-pressure natural gas pipeline joint venture projects in anhui and hebei provinces. it has also joined hands with shell group to invest and operate a high-pressure natural gas pipeline system in hangzhou, zhejiang province.
investing in these projects will enable the group to open up other downstream joint venture projects and thus further strengthen the group s development in the city-gas market. in addition, the group has been proactive in developing other natural gas-related businesses including natural gas filling stations for automobiles and district gas airconditioning given the mainland s robust economic development, the demand for energy will continue to increase rapidly. as a result of a temporary shortage of coal, oil and electricity, energy prices remain at a high level.
in comparison, natural gas excels both in terms of price level and environmental benefits, and hence its market potential is huge. the group s mainland city-gas joint ventures are highly praised for their safety, modern management and quality service provision and they have built up an excellent brand reputation across all cities where they are located.
therefore, the group forecasts a very promising future for its gas business, with a primary focus on natural gas.
leveraging its rich experience in the city piped gas utility business and its professional expertise in the construction, management and operation of pipelines, the group has diversified its business portfolio to include the water supply and wastewater business. synergies between city piped gas and water businesses could certainly increase the cost-effectiveness of both operations. the chinese government is currently taking a proactive approach to reforming the water sector in order to cope with the increasing demand for clean water and this is providing excellent opportunities for the group to diversify into the water sector.
in 2005, the group successfully entered the mainland s water sector.
following the successful establishment of water supply joint ventures in wujiang, jiangsu province and wuhu, anhui province, in the second half of 2005, the group established an integrated water supply and wastewater joint venture project with suzhou industrial park in suzhou, jiangsu province. suzhou industrial park is geographically welllocated given its proximity to shanghai, hangzhou and nanjing, and enjoys robust economic development. with a 50 per cent interest in this project, the group has further consolidated its investment in the water sector on the mainland.
the group s investment in these three water projects amounts to approximately rmb2 billion in total.
with increasing urbanisation on the mainland and growth in the size of cities, the consumption of water will continue to increase steadily. the group will seek to capture opportunities resulting from the further opening up of this utility market and continue to develop other city-water projects with a view to further expanding its scope of investments.
the group s business development on the mainland is progressing well and its businesses are now spread across 33 cities in nine provinces and an area of beijing. from a local company focusing on a single business, the group is gradually transforming into a sizable, nationwide, the group s liquefied petroleum gas (lpg) filling station business is run by a wholly-owned subsidiary company, eco energy company limited (eco). eco s turnover continued to grow despite rising lpg costs in 2005. one of the major reasons for growth last year was expansion in the number of public light buses using lpg.
eco s landfill gas project at the north east new territories (nent) landfill site is progressing well. design of a landfill gas treatment facility has already been completed and installation work commenced at the end of 2005. a 19 km pipeline to tai po gas production plant, now under construction, is due for completion by april 2006. the plant will use substitute natural gas produced from treated landfill gas to partially replace naphtha as fuel for town gas production starting from the second quarter of 2006, thereby contributing to the group s commitment to protect paralleling hong kong s development, several substantial pipelaying projects are currently construction of a 24 km transmission pipeline in the eastern new territories to augment the capability and reliability of gas supply is progressing smoothly. town gas supply has been extended to the international theme park at penny s bay on lantau island which was opened in september 2005.
in order to receive natural gas from the guangdong liquefied natural gas terminal, the group is laying a twin 34 km, 450 mm-diameter submarine pipeline from chengtoujiao in shenzhen to tai po gas production plant in hong kong.
the project is progressing smoothly.
by the fourth quarter of 2006, the guangdong lng terminal should be supplying natural gas to hong kong which will then be used to partially replace naphtha as feedstock for the production of the group gives high priority to quality management, customer services and enhancement of shareholder value, all of which have consistently won us public recognition, both locally and abroad.
