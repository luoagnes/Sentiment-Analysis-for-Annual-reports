the financial year 20112012 was a challenging year for policy makers, businesses and financial sectors around the globe. the economic conditions in the euro zone have had wide-spread effects across industries and countries. given the complexity of the national debt issues and the number of nations involved, a significant amount of resources, efforts and time are needed to bring the economies back on their growth tracks. the economy of the euro zone is expected to be soft for a period of time.

in the united states, the economy is on a course of recovery despite mixed signals from the economic data. federal reserve s accommodative stance for monetary policy will be conducive to support the growth momentum. with global economic conditions remaining volatile, the year ahead is expected to remain uncertain.

china has been developing its own model to manage its economy for counteracting cyclical trends and structural changes to stabilize growth. the easing of economic growth in the first two quarters of this calendar year was anticipated by policy makers because of the policy shift from the last three decades of export-led growth to consumption-led growth. central government s approach in exercising reforms in the areas of banking and housing will lead to a better allocation of resources and distribution of income.

the increase in household formation and the number of marriages and births have created new demand for housing. the home buyers continue to benefit from the low mortgage interest rates and good liquidity from the banking sector. not only does the low interest rate environment make mortgage loan repayment more affordable, home owners can earn a positive return by leasing their flats.

the hksar government s policy to develop a balanced mix of public rental housing, home ownership scheme and private housing, will address the housing needs of different income groups. the regular land sales initiated by the hksar government, land application list system, and the supply of sites from the mass transit railway corporation and urban renewal authority of hong kong will maintain a continuous supply of sites for residential development. the hksar government has indicated that there will be more land made available for private housing development. the group with its cash resources is well positioned to participate on this opportunity to acquire land with good development value.
