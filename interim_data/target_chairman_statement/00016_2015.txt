property business hong kong
in the year under review, the group stayed active in the land market and acquired six sites through public tenders. these sites, with a combined gross floor area of 4.9 million square feet, are at strategic locations and will be utilized mostly for developing large-scale residential projects that offer economies of scale. the majority of the units to be built will be of small-to-medium sizes. site details are shown in the following table.
driven by active land acquisitions, the group s land bank has been expanding in recent years. as at the end of june 2015, the group s total land bank in hong kong amounted to 50.8 million square feet, comprising 28.7 million square feet of completed investment properties and 22.1 million square feet of properties under development. the group also held over 30 million square feet in terms of site area of agricultural land spanning throughout the new territories.
these sites are mostly located along existing or planned railway lines and under various stages of land use conversions.
after the end of the financial year, the group continued to capitalize on land acquisition opportunities in hong kong and successfully bid for the tenders for developing two additional sites. in july, the group acquired a site in ma tau kok close to an mtr station currently under construction with a total gross floor area of about 105,000 square feet. in the following month, the development right for another site above the mtr yuen long station with a total gross floor area of 1.5 million square feet was acquired. this development will provide nearly 1,900 residential units and about 107,000 square feet of retail space, bringing much synergy as an integral part of the group s yoho mall. a substantial portion of these two developments will offer residential units of mainly small-to-medium sizes. with these two new acquisitions, the group s total land bank in hong kong has been increased to 52.4 million sales in the primary market stayed robust with active new launches by developers, while transactions in the secondary market were affected by further tightening of mortgage financing by the authority in late february this year and the recent stock market volatility. interest rates stayed at a low level, despite anticipations for a modest increase in us interest rates beginning later this year. this low interest rate environment, together with positive demographic trends and sustained income growth, continued to underpin demand, particularly for the segment of small- to medium-sized units.
the group continues to strengthen its market position, underpinned by its active new project launches. during the year, the group offered a wide range of products for sale and generated a favourable response from the market. residential projects comprising mainly small- to mediumsized units, including the wings iiia and the wings iiib in tseung kwan o, and the first phase of century link in tung chung, have been over 95% sold. luxury projects were also well received, including deauville in tsuen wan west, a new batch of units of the cullinan at airport express kowloon station, and the houses at twelve peaks and 50 stanley village road on hong kong island.
offices at w50 in wong chuk hang were virtually sold out shortly after the project was put up for sale in july last year. all these have contributed to the strong contracted sales of nearly hk$32,000 million in hong kong for the year. the initial batches of ultima in ho man tin were put onto the market in june this year. with an average price of about hk$40 million for each unit sold, the development generated sales of about hk$4,500 million from june to august.
an indispensable part of the group s corporate culture is the pursuit of excellence. over the years, it has earned a reputation for quality products and services, which enables it to command a price premium in the market. apart from premium materials and fine finishes, the group is also recognized for its expertise in integrating the design and master layout of its projects with the surrounding environment. these value enhancement endeavours, together with better construction cost management, have helped support the margins of development projects.
during the year, the group completed more than one million square feet of properties in hong kong, of which 900,000 square feet supported by a sizable portfolio of investment properties with over 28.7 million square feet of gross floor area, the group s rental business in hong kong delivered a healthy performance during the year. gross rental income, including contributions from joint-venture projects, rose by 7% to hk$15,675 million, mainly driven by positive rental reversions and higher rents for new leases. overall occupancy also remained high at around 95%.

with an extensive network of shopping malls, the group now owns over ten million square feet of retail space in hong kong. this quality and diversified portfolio continued to reinforce the group s leading position in the retail leasing market and supported its rental income growth. overall tenant sales growth at major shopping malls outperformed the hong kong retail market, with positive rental reversions and high occupancy.
with a primary focus on serving local customers, the group s regional malls in diversified locations have built up a solid customer base over the years and continued to benefit from the growth in domestic consumption. such renowned malls as apm, ifc mall, new town plaza, tai po mega mall, landmark north, east point city and v city sustained their satisfactory performance. tenant mix refinements were carried out to better meet the needs of the neighborhoods. additional trendy fashion and lifestyle brands as well as popular eateries were introduced to enhance overall shopping experience for customers.
the group has made considerable efforts to enhance the asset quality of the existing malls to maintain their competitiveness. this commitment to premium quality is well demonstrated by the renovation and reconfiguration of the grand century place mall in mong kok, which was renamed moko. with the completion of its renovation in august this year, the mall has introduced various international brands and restaurants that are either new to the district or to the city. the new layouts with themed floors and additional escalators have drawn higher traffic flows and offered customers greater convenience.
the mall is now fully let and has recorded significant rental income growth.
renovations at other malls are also progressing well. to capitalize on opportunities arising from kowloon east, apm is currently implementing various upgrading works, including the conversion of over 150,000 square feet of office space into retail use as well as an extensive greening project at the podium garden. metroplaza is a shopping hub for its neighbouring area, serving locals and the nearby office workforce. its renovation work, commenced late last year to enhance its market positioning, covers floor layout reconfiguration, indoor decor enhancement, as well as additional greening at the outdoor piazza. tenant mix will also be further refined with the introduction of international trendy brands.
the group s retail portfolio will be further bolstered with the addition of new projects in the pipeline. to be opened in phases, yoho mall, comprising sun yuen long centre, the retail portions of yoho midtown and grand yoho as well as the retail space of the recently acquired site above mtr yuen long station, covers an area of about 1.1 million square feet. the retail space of yoho midtown has opened recently. renovation of the adjacent sun yuen long centre will also be completed in late 2015. these two parts, which are fully let, will provide a retail space of over 500,000 square feet and house over 200 shops, including a variety of international eateries, some of which are entering northwest new territories for the first time. the 470,000-square-foot retail space under grand yoho is scheduled to open in 2017. the site above mtr yuen long station will provide an additional 107,000 square feet of retail area. yoho mall will feature leisure elements including 120,000 square feet of green space and an outdoor piazza to offer customers a relaxing shopping environment. upon its full completion, yoho mall will represent the largest shopping destination in northwest new territories, comparable to new town plaza in the east.
following yoho mall, other upcoming additions to the group s retail network will include popwalk in tseung kwan o and harbour north in north point. to be developed in phases, popwalk, beneath the group s residential projects near mtr tseung kwan o station, will have a total of over 240,000 square feet of retail space. given its proximity and easy access to the mtr station and nearby properties, popwalk is well positioned to capture the rising demand for shopping, entertainment and leisure in the expanding community. the first phase of popwalk, with around 66,000 square feet of retail space, is scheduled to open in the second quarter of 2016 and the market response to pre-leasing has been meanwhile, harbour north situated right next to mtr north point station will house over 140,000 square feet of retail space with a diverse mix of tenants, targeting residents and people working in the neighborhood as well as tourists. with a glamorous facade spanning 270 metres on java road, high quality tenants will be attracted and will help turn the street into a prosperous retail avenue. in addition, customers can enjoy al fresco dining along the 410-metre waterfront promenade with a panoramic view of victoria harbour. the project will be developed in two phases and is expected to further enhance the group s rental income in the medium term. apart from this, a premium shopping mall atop mtr nam cheong station is also under development.
served by an extensive network, the mall will provide 300,000 square feet of retail space for residents in the vicinity and from the densely populated west kowloon.

during the year under review, modest rental growth and low vacancy rates were seen for grade-a offices in most areas of hong kong.
situated in prime locations of various districts, the group s ten-million-squarefoot office space generated promising results for the year. occupancy levels remained high, and steady growth in rental income was recorded. the group s premium offices, located mainly along railway lines with quality buildings and professional property management, have always been the preferred choices for multinational corporations.
leasing demand for premium office space in central has been solid during the year amid limited new supply while occupancies at the world-renowned international finance centre (ifc) further picked up to almost fully let. as a prestigious address for international financial institutions in hong kong, ifc also saw strong demand from mainland financial institutions.
international commerce centre (icc), above airport express kowloon station and next to the future guangzhou-shenzhen-hong kong express rail link terminus, offers tenants unparalleled convenience. rising demand from major financial institutions, including those from the mainland, has enabled spot rent at icc to remain high. strong rental reversions on new leases and renewals were recorded during the year.
the group s office portfolio in other areas also performed well. with robust demand from both multinationals and local enterprises, occupancy of the group s millennium city cluster remained high, and positive rental reversions were achieved for the year. other premium office space such as sun hung kai centre in wan chai, grand central plaza in sha tin, and metroplaza in kwai fong continued to attract quality tenants from diverse sectors with high occupancies during the year.
