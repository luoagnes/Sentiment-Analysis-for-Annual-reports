market review and outlook 2010 signifies the beginning of shimao property s third decade in china, and it is also a year full of uncertainties. to rein in soaring land and property prices, the central government has been issuing a series of regulatory measures since end of last year, resulting in tightened overall control over land supply, tax and credits. the people s bank of china has so far raised the reserve requirement ratio by 0.5%. rate hike expectations are also getting higher. these all signal tightening credit in 2010, which in turn means another significant challenge to real estate enterprises capital chain. wen jiabao, premier of the state council, stated in the 2010 government work report that the government will promote the healthy and stable development of the property market, curb the precipitous rise of housing prices in some cities, improve the methods for managing and using income from land, keep land prices from rising too fast, rein in speculative home purchases, and support self-use house consumption. such measures set the rational and clear direction for the long- term development of the industry.
china is undergoing an unprecedented urbanization process. at present, china s urbanization ratio is approximately 47%. according to the central government s road map, the urbanization ratio will rise to 60% by 2020, and if so, it is estimated that a rural population of over 100 million will become urban population in the coming 10 years. the huge solid demand resulted from such conversion, coupled with the fact that land supply in china is limited, will be a big boost for the real estate market.
looking ahead to 2010, we see opportunities as well as challenges. we need to be well prepared for all our work, fully implement our standardization and refinement management strategy, enhance the group s each and every competitiveness, and closely monitor macroeconomic policies and changes in the market. we strongly believe that a strong financial position, prudent land bidding strategy and outstanding management will be the foundation for sustainable development for all real estate enterprises. we will take the opportunity to further enhance our sales to meet our target of achieving rmb30 billion of contracted sales in 2010. in the hotel property and commercial property businesses, the group believes that the upcoming world expo 2010 in shanghai will boost our hotel property and commercial property businesses and thus we are optimistic about their future performance.
in such a rapidly changing global economy, we must have deep insight into and be responsive to the market so that we will not let any opportunities slip through our fingers and be able to manage and deal with any risks. despite the unpredictable policy conditions and market conditions in 2010, the group will ensure the achievement of its operational targets by closely watching and analyzing the market trends and responding to them in a timely manner.
