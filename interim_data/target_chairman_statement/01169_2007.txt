given the injected businesses continue to be controlled by the haier group before and after the asset injection (through its majority shareholding in the company), the combined financial statements of the group for the year have been prepared using merger accounting under a basis as if the asset injection has been completed at the earliest date presented. accordingly, the contribution from the injected businesses for the full year of 2006 has been reflected in the group s combined financial statements for the year and all comparative figures have been restated to incorporate the financial results of the injected businesses. the analysis that follows is therefore based on the combined results of the existing top loading washing machine business and the injected businesses for the full year of 2006 and comparative figures restated on such basis.
