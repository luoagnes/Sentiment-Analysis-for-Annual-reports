activity in hong kong s residential market has been constrained by further government cooling measures and tightened mortgage financing, while positive factors including still low mortgage interest rates and continuing income growth remained in place. although transactions in the secondary market slowed in recent months, sales in the primary market were generally good. this activity slowdown should be a natural adjustment conducive to a sustainable and healthy market.
with short-term speculators mostly staying away from the market, demand came mainly from genuine end-users and long-term investors, including some mainland buyers. the government s efforts to increase future land supply should provide more development opportunities for the group achieved exceptional results in the pre-sale market for the year under review, selling or pre-selling hk$36,897 million of hong kong properties, up from last year s hk$20,562 million. all new projects put on sale, including valais at beas river, larvotto in island south, one regent place in yuen long, avignon on castle peak road and i uniq residence in island east, were well received by the market. the group has also sold some non-core offices with good results. sales since july 2011 have remained encouraging at over hk$12,000 million, coming mainly from sales of imperial cullinan on the west kowloon waterfront and i uniq grand in island east.

the leasing market for various types of properties was buoyant over the past year. the robust demand for quality office space was driven by expansion in the corporate sector, and higher mainland visitor spending and continued local consumption growth fuelled demand for retail space.
rents continued to rise with the limited new supplies in both segments and low vacancies.
the group owns the largest portfolio of quality investment properties in hong kong totalling 27.7 million square feet. it is well diversified both in terms of usage and geographic distribution. the rental portfolio recorded increased rents and higher occupancy of over 95 per cent in the year.

the first phase of kowloon commerce centre (kcc) houses international logistics, electronics and telecommunication companies and is near-fully leased. a new air-conditioned footbridge to a nearby mtr station also increased its competitiveness, complementing the convenient road access to the airport, container terminals and the border. the group is developing the second phase of kcc with a gross floor area of over 500,000 square feet, scheduled for completion in early 2013.

the group is also one of the largest retail landlords in hong kong, with a shopping mall portfolio totalling ten million square feet. the most recent addition is mikiki, a shopping mall exceeding 200,000 square feet that opened in august this year and is almost fully leased. its modern interior design and tailored tenant mix provide customers, particularly young people, an enjoyable shopping experience. mikiki will also have the added attraction of proximity to the forthcoming world-class cruise terminal in kai tak.
leveraging the success of developing and leasing regional shopping centres since the opening of new town plaza in sha tin in the mid-1980s, the group is creating another regional shopping and entertainment hub, yoho mall adjacent to the mtr yuen long station. this yoho mall will comprise one million square feet of gross floor area, including a new shopping centre of over 470,000 square feet under development and two malls in the neighbourhood. it will become a major landmark, drawing the spending power in the west new territories, particularly the younger generation, and the growing pool of mainland shoppers. its dynamic, modern and international flair, featuring a wide variety of leading outlets including international fashions, chic accessories, the latest electronics and superb cuisine, will set a new trend for the shopping mall sector.
the construction of another shopping mall of about 270,000 square feet at the mtr tuen mun station is progressing well and scheduled to finish by late 2012. this mall is designed to offer fresh, lifestyle shopping for the young middle class. pre-leasing has been well received. superior positioning and a prime location will make this a focal point for shopping and leisure in the district.
shoppers habits and pre ferences are constantly changing, so the group takes steps to enhance the competitiveness of its malls with renovations, refinements to trade and tenant mixes and marketing and promotions. apm in kowloon east is being renovated in phases to give young consumers a more interesting and spacious shopping environment. ifc mall s tenant and trade mix was also refined with the latest international luxury retailers. various innovative promotions and mark e t i n g campaign s i n c l u d i n g e-promotions and shopping tours, particularly for mainlanders, were conducted to boost mall residential and serviced suites leasing of the group s premium residential port folio and ser viced suites was also encouraging. the prime locations and topquality service offered by four seasons place at hong kong station and the harbourview place at kowloon station appeal to guests from all over the world, and occupancy was around 90 per cent. the group s luxury units for lease under signature homes such as dynasty court in mid-levels and pacific view in island south are over 90 per cent let.

residential markets in major mainland cities saw slow activity and softening prices amid continued tightening measures, while those in many second and third tier cities remained buoyant during the year. additional housing measures, in particular the extension of home purchase restrictions to second and third tier cities, are likely to dampen sales, but this should be conducive to a sustainable and healthy market over the longer term.
the group continued to apply its hong kong expertise to develop high-end residences on the mainland despite a challenging market environment. it recorded satisfactory property sales of over hk$2,000 million on the mainland in the year, including sales of the second phase of lake dragon in guangzhou. homebuyers have generally been impressed with the outstanding quality and designs of the group s seven projects with 5.6 million square feet of attributable gross floor area were completed on the mainland during the year, of which 3.6 million square feet are residential for sale.

the group did not enter into any speculative positions in relation to derivatives or structured products, and its foreign exchange exposure was small with most of its assets and financings denominated in hong kong dollars.
the group s solid financial foundations and premier market leadership have earned it an a1 rating from moody s and an a+ rating from standard & poor s, with stable outlooks for both. the group consistently has the strongest credit rating among hong kong developers.

the global economy will continue to see various challenges in the year ahead. while the persistent european sovereign debt crisis, recession worries and the aftermath of the credit agency downgrade for the us remain key overhangs, financial market volatility and inflation in the emerging economies may also be market concerns. however, the fed s stance of close-to-zero us policy interest rate for about two years, as well as a low-interest-rate environment in most other developed countries should help support the world economy.
economic growth on the mainland is likely to moderate amid a tightened policy environment in the near future but remain high by international standards. the central government should be able to manage well economic challenges including inflation risks and weakness in external demand. the group remains confident in mainland s long-term prospects, though the operating environment for the residential sector on the mainland is likely to remain challenging on the back of tough regulatory measures on home purchases.
hong kong s economic fundamentals are expected to remain healthy despite a challenging external environment. healthy domestic demand and high visitor spending will be the key growth drivers. the latest favourable policy measures for hong kong enacted by the central government will certainly boost the territory s prospects. the move to enlarge and deepen its role as an offshore rmb centre in particular will be positive for hong kong s long-term development. these, together with negative real interest rates amid rising inflation, continuing income growth and interest from mainlanders should underpin residential property demand. however, recent local government measures and the likelihood of policy changes may affect hong kong s residential market. nevertheless, increasing land supply and hence more housing completions should be beneficial to the residential market over medium to long term.
the group s property business in hong kong will continue to grow as it bolsters its market position and competitive edge by offering buyers premium services and the best products with magnificent designs, efficient layouts and comprehensive facilities. it will also keep on acquiring new sites at the right times through various means, particularly when more land supply becomes available.
the group will continue offering new projects for sale both in hong kong and on the mainland. major residential projects in hong kong to go on sale include the first-class development the wings at tseung kwan o town centre, phase 1 of a high-end residence atop the mtr tuen mun station, the luxury chatham gate in kowloon and a low-density development in east yuen long. major mainland projects that will go on sale include the luxury residences with glamorous views of the bund in the first phase of shanghai arch at lujiazui, lakefront houses in the first phase of lake genve in suzhou, first phase of the liede project and remaining batches of lake dragon phase 2 both in guangzhou.
the group s rental income will continue to do well both in hong kong and on the mainland.
rents of its portfolio are likely to rise on the back of its continuous management efforts and positive leasing market conditions. its recurrent income will be further boosted through positive rental reversions, tenants enhanced sales performances, and additions of new investment properties, particularly prime shopping malls. in hong kong, the yoho mall under development in the west new territories will be a regional shopping and entertainment hub comparable to new town plaza. i ts opening by 2014 will further strengthen the group s leading position in the shopping mall sector. on the mainland, the group s retail portfolio will also expand with the scheduled opening of international apm at shanghai icc in 2012 and the second phase of shanghai ifc mall. all these will help build an extensive network of shopping malls across hong kong and the mainland.
the group will also make its shopping malls more attractive with regular refurbishments and constant reviews of tenant and trade mixes. focused marketing and promotions concentrating on mainland visitors will continue to boost pedestrian flows and consumer spending in hong kong.
the group s premium hotel portfolio will continue to expand with seve r a l new additions providing a total of over 800 rooms in attributable terms over the next three to four years. these new hotels, being parts of integrated projects, will be at good locations in hong kong and key mainland cities. earnings from this business segment are expected to rise over time.
the group aims to achieve a balance for earnings from property sales and investment properties, both in hong kong and on the mainland, through enhancing asset turnover and recurrent income. the mainland investment property portfolio will further expand with the completion of new integrated projects in key mainland cities in the longer term. the shanghai ifc and shanghai icc integrated projects will reinforce the visibility of its premium brand on the mainland when completed. the group will maintain a selective strategy for mainland business when good opportunities arise, focusing on key cities including beijing, shanghai, guangzhou and shenzhen.
with all these positive developments of the group, the results for the coming financial year are expected to be satisfactory, barring unforeseen directors and appreciation having been the company s chairman since may 2008, i will retire at the annual general meeting on 8 december 2011 to pursue my personal and family matters. the board has appointed mr. thomas kwok and mr.
raymond kwok as joint chairmen with effect from the close of the annual general meeting, and their roles as managing directors and executive directors remain unchanged. both thomas and raymond have been with the group for over 30 years, and for the past 20 years, they have been acting as vice chairmen and managing directors. i am confident that this appointment will be in the best long-term interest of the group.
mr. lo chiu chun, clement, a non-executive director of the company, will retire from office by rotation at the annual general meeting and will not seek re-election. having served as a director of the company since 1975, mr. lo has been instrumental in the development and growth of the group. i would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to mr. lo for his invaluable contribution to the group over the years.
