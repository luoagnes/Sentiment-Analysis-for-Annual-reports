2005 proved to be a tough year for our mvas business. the termination of the 161 m-chat fee sharing arrangement with china mobile had a negative impact on our business. in addition, we continued to experience cleaning up of inactive user accounts by mobile operators. these factors resulted in a decrease in our fee-based mobile and telecommunications value-added services registered subscriptions and revenues.

more importantly, these investments are intended to build a strong foundation for us to better serve our users and provide more compelling value-added services to them going forward. we believe that it is extremely important to keep strengthening our r&d and our pool of talents in order to stay ahead in this attractive yet increasingly competitive in our core im platform, our qq im service remained the most popular im service in china and has achieved a new record of over 200 million active user accounts and our estimated active peak simultaneous online user accounts was 16.7 million. we aim to better serve this large community of users not only through enhancing the platform s functionalities and safety, but also through providing more value-added services that address the many facets of our users online lives, including staying in touch with others, access to content, getting entertained and conducting 6 tencent holdings limited chairman s statement during the fourth quarter of 2005, our internet value-added services were driven by favorable user responses to our family of online identities products and strong growth in our online games business. in the area of online identities products, we built on the success of qq show and launched qzone and qq pet in the course of 2005. qzone and qq pet have received good initial response from our users and have accumulated a sizable user base. our plan is to continue upgrading our technical platforms and refining our products accordingly such that we can provide better experiences to our users. in our online games business, qq game portal remained the leading casual games platform in china with over 2 million peak simultaneous online user accounts. we aim to monetize its leadership by increasing paid subscriptions and game item sales. we also plan to leverage this popular platform to present advanced casual games, which generally have stronger monetization mechanism, to our users. in 2005, our first self-developed advanced casual game, qq tang, was quite successful in generating both user traffic and revenue. we plan to launch more advanced casual games, including both licensed and self-developed, during the course of 2006. in the fourth quarter of 2005, our first self-developed mmog, qq fantasy, made a remarkable debut by achieving 660,000 peak simultaneous online user accounts online during open beta testing. we began charging for the game in december and believe it will increase our online games revenue. after significant investments in online games, we expect our online games revenue to increase significantly.
during 2005, our mobile and telecommunications value-added services were negatively affected by changes in industry policies and intensifying competition. while visibility remains low in the near term, we are making proactive steps to manage these challenges by cooperating closely with telecom operators and strengthening our own competitiveness. we are looking into developing new features and products to create more value for our users. to prepare us for the advent of 3g, we are also customizing our internet-based services, such as networked mini-casual games, music and online community services, for our wireless platforms.
