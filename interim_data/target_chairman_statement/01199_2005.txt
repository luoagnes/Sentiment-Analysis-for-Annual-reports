in 2004, cosco pacific achieved robust growth in profits. share price of the company outperformed the market for two consecutive years, making our stock one of the strongest performers among the constituent stocks of the hang seng index.
last year, cosco pacific celebrated the tenth anniversary of its listing in hong kong by heralding the tremendous growth the company has achieved in its operations and container fleet, along with the robust expansion in its market share of the container leasing sector and the throughput of its container terminals. while focusing on delivering accelerating growth, the company will continue to explore new projects and to invest in related operations in line with its goal of becoming an international corporation.
upward trend of the global economy the global economy continued its rebound in 2004. global economic growth in 2004 was primarily attributable to china and the united states. the economies of the two countries created synergies and provided a major driving force for global economic expansion. this upswing in the economy led to rapid growth of the global shipping market which in turn helped to fuel the development of container related businesses.

during the year, economic growth in china continued to perform strongly. according to the data released by the national bureau of statistics of china, the country s gross domestic product ( gdp )rose by 9.5% (2003: 9.1%) while the consumer price index rose by 3.9% from the previous year. china economy remains a world focus due to this robust growth.

in addition, given a year-on-year growth of 35.7% to us$1,154,740,000,000 in aggregate import and export trade volume, china has become one of the world s three largest trading countries. according to the world trade organisation, it took 20 and 26 years respectively for the us and germany to increase their import and export trade volume from us$100,000,000,000 to us$1,000,000,000,000, while china accomplished a similar growth in only 16 years. indeed, the country s import and export trade volume has soared by 750 times over the last 55 years, making china the driving force of economic development around the globe.
focusing on the china market the rapid development of china's economy fuelled a continuous expansion in foreign trade and increased terminal throughput in 2004. this in turn led to growth in the domestic container leasing and manufacturing sectors. based on the latest statistics by the prc s ministry of communications, it is estimated that china's total container throughput reached 61,800,000 teus in 2004, representing a year-on-year growth of 27%. in view of this growth in container throughput, it is expected that there is still vast room for expansion of the chinese container terminal sector, and the container transportation sector of china is poised to become one of the hot spots in the global shipping industry.

aggressive exploration of the global market in 2004, ports in europe and the us benefited from the increase in exports from china. major european hubs including rotterdam, hamburg and antwerp experienced continued growth in throughput. during the year, the trade volume between asia and the us rose steadily, leading to substantial market demand for north american ports.
