the global financial tsunami hit the global economy badly and damaged business confidence throughout the world.
looking ahead, the growth of the business will depend on the ability of the global economy to recover from the financial crisis and the year 2009 will be very challenging for the industry of paints and petrochemical and related products. despite the adverse market conditions, the group aims to reinforce its competitiveness, consolidate its relationship with customers, expand its customer base, increase the sale of its high-yield products and enhance product quality in order to maintain continual growth when the global economy revives from the financial crisis.
in light of the global financial crisis, the group will take a more cautious view in its investment activities. equipped with a strong and healthy financial position, the group is well-placed to continue to identify grossly under-valued investment opportunities in order to diversify the business of the group and maximize returns for its shareholders.
