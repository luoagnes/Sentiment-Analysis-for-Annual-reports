product market reviews primary aluminum market in 2014, the international and domestic price of primary aluminum showed an inclination of picking up following an initial dip. in terms of international market, the international price of aluminum was suppressed in the first quarter due to the influence by the extreme cold weather of usa and the downturn of global economy. after the second quarter, the international price of aluminum started to recover with the pickup of the main international economic body especially the economy of usa and shortage of supply resulting from the reduction in production volume of international aluminum plants.
in 2014, the average price of three-month aluminum futures at lme amounted to usd1,893 per tonne, representing a year-on-year increase of 0.26%. in terms of domestic market, under the background of overcapacity situation, due to the supply of funds being shrunk in respect of electrolytic aluminum enterprises by the bank and traditional off-season of consumption in the first quarter, the price of aluminum declined sharply and capacity was shut down massively. in the second and third quarter, the primary aluminum supply became strain periodically due to the closed capacity, which led to the reviving of the aluminum price. however, with the occurrence of new capacity and resumption of production one after another, the aluminum price as forced down generally due to the over supply in the fourth quarter.
in 2014, the average price of three-month aluminum futures at shfe amounted to rmb13,697 per tonne, representing a year-on-year decrease of 6.13%.
according to the statistics, the global output and consumption of primary aluminum for year 2014 were approximately 53.90 million tonnes and approximately 54.85 million tonnes, respectively; while the domestic output and consumption of primary aluminum were approximately 28.10 million tonnes and approximately 28.05 million tonnes, respectively. as of the end of december in 2014, the capacity utilization rate of primary aluminum enterprises in the world (inclusive of the prc) was 79.64%, while that of the prc was 78.40%.

in 2014, the domestic and international price of alumina rose after declining. in terms of international market, the price trend of international alumina mainly keeps consistent with that of domestic price of alumina due to china being the main buyer in the international market of alumina. in 2014, the average price of alumina in the international spot market amounted to usd330 per tonne, representing a year- on-year increase of 1.23%. in terms of domestic market, the demands for alumina reduced due to the massively electrolytic aluminum capacity shutting down in the first quarter, resulting in that the price reached a low point throughout the year. due to the increase in the new and resumption of electrolytic aluminum capacity in the second and third quarter, alumina supply became strain periodically and the price increased accordingly. in 2014, the average spot price of alumina in domestic market amounted to rmb2,541 per tonne, representing a year-on-year increase of 1.76%.
according to the statistics, the global output and consumption of alumina for 2014 were approximately 112.27 million tonnes and approximately 111.28 million tonnes, respectively. the domestic output and consumption of alumina were approximately 51.25 million tonnes and approximately 56.23 million tonnes, respectively. imported alumina in the prc amounted to approximately 5.28 million tonnes in 2014. as of the end of december 2014, the alumina capacity utilization rate of alumina enterprises in the world (inclusive of the prc) was approximately 80.51%, while that of the prc was approximately in 2014, the macro economy of the prc presented an overall stable situation, with the economic growth maintaining in reasonable range. however, due to the relatively heavy pressure of downtrend in economy, the severe overcapacity in the aluminum industry has not been effectively eased yet.
