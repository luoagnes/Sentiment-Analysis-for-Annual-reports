chairman s statement kwee chong kok, michael chairman during the past fiscal year, frasers property (china) made significant progress in refining its management structure whilst navigating through the challenges of a volatile property market in china. our strategy is clear : we will direct our resources towards creating a growing inventory of residential development properties for sale in the greater shanghai and guangzhou regions thereby cementing our presence in our target markets. this will allow us to realise short-term returns that will fuel and sustain our long-term growth, while continuing to attract the necessary human resources to build out the regional offices thus ensuring that our company will continue to be a competitive developer in the china in shanghai, we are well positioned with a large residential development site with approximately 737,000 sm of permissible gross floor area for future development. whilst residential units at our shanghai shanshui four seasons project phase 1 are almost sold out, development on sub-phases 2a and 2b will be our next important milestones.
construction of sub-phase 2a is progressing on schedule and we are set to meet our pre-sales target in 2012.
given the current market condition in china, there are opportunities in the guangzhou area. whilst phases 1 and 2 of vision shenzhen business park are fully occupied, development of phase 3 is now in the planning stages. this latest phase 3 development will deliver stable recurring rental income from the expanded business park. consistent with the development strategy of the company, we will continue to target residential development projects in guangzhou area.
although market volatility in china has increased resulting from recent government imposed measures, nevertheless we continue to remain positive on the long term prospects given the fundamentals of the market including a growing middle class, urbanisation and rising per capita income. with expected consolidation of the industry and the basic fundamentals of the china market, we are confident of our ability to realise our stated goals.
