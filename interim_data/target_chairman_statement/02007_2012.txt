the group launched 16 new projects for pre-sales in 2011, among which 10 were in guangdong province. new projects were welcomed by the home purchasers when they were initially launched, and recorded an aggregate contracted sales of approximately rmb12.8 billion. of which, the group s second project in huizhou city of guangdong province, country garden ten miles beach, which was launched on 30 july, had more than 70% of the 5,080 units of the initial launch being subscribed on the fi rst day with transaction amount of over rmb3 billion; the group s second project in jiangsu province, country garden phoenix city (jurong), which was launched for pre-sales on 15 may, had over 70% of the approximately 2,500 units initially launched being subscribed in the fi rst two days of launch with transaction amount of nearly rmb1.2 billion. these successful new projects have provided sustainable high-quality products to the group.
the group continued to achieve strong results in guangdong province, its core market, which accounted for around 66% of the group s total contracted sales. moreover, with the new projects outside guangdong province gradually reaching the delivery phases, and the improvement in the surrounding environment and ancillary facilities of these new projects over the past two to three years, the board believes that the recognition of country garden s brand name has been further enhanced outside guangdong province. this will not only boost the revenue growth of these new projects, but will also set a solid foundation for the long-term development of the group. the ratio of the contracted sales of the projects outside guangdong province to that of the group has increased from approximately 24% in 2008 to approximately 34% in 2011, which verifi es that the group s successful business model in guangdong province is replicable in places outside guangdong province.
as at 31 december 2011, the group has 103 projects under different stages of development, including 62 in guangdong province. attributable gfa with land use right certifi cates was approximately 54.85 million sq.m.
(approximately 45.4% in guangdong province), among which attributable gfa with construction permits was around 15.31 million sq.m.. with the steady development in china, the group is delighted to enter into an agreement on 23 december 2011 with mayland group, a well-known property development and investment group in malaysia, to establish a joint venture company to acquire certain land use rights in malaysia for developing into residential and ancillary commercial properties.
the encouraging and steadily growing contract sales during the year further validates the strong replicability and sustainability of country garden s business model, and proves that the strategy of offering high-value-for-money products has won extensive market recognition. it also demonstrates the group s strong dedication, in accordance with the national policy, to develop high-quality housings that are affordable by the public.
