the mainland economy maintained strong momentum in 2010 benefiting the group s city-gas and natural gas businesses which recorded continuous growth in the year under review. the group s development of emerging projects, through its wholly-owned subsidiary eco environmental investments limited and the latter s subsidiaries (together known as eco ), is also progressing well. eco is currently at a stage of developing projects for investment. construction work for some of its projects has already begun. in the long run, both city-gas and emerging businesses on the mainland have good prospects and investment overall, as at the end of 2010, inclusive of projects of the group s subsidiary, towngas china company limited ( towngas china ; stock code: 1083.hk), the group had 120 projects spread across 20 provinces encompassing upstream, midstream and downstream natural gas sectors, the water supply and wastewater treatment sectors, natural gas filling stations and emerging environmentally-friendly energy and energy resources projects.
diversification and an increase in the number of projects are rapidly transforming the group from a locally-based company centred on a single business into a sizable, corporation with a focus on and the energy sector.
utility businesses in
the group s city-gas businesses progressed well in 2010, with a further new project successfully established in yonganzhou industrial park, taizhou, jiangsu province.
inclusive of eight new projects established by towngas china in 2010, the group had 93 city-gas projects in mainland cities spread across 17 provincesautonomous regionsmunicipalities as at the end of 2010. during the year under review, the number of gas customers on the mainland reached 11.88 million and total volume of gas sales was 8,540 million cubic metres. the group has now become the largest city-gas enterprise on the mainland.
in the coming years, with completion of large-scale natural gas projects, including the transmission pipelines from sichuan province to eastern and southern china and phase two of the west-to-east pipeline, and an increase in the quantity of imported liquefied natural gas, together with national sources, the current shortfall in natural gas supply will be mitigated. the group therefore anticipates its mainland projects will have access to sufficient gas sources to enable them to continue to thrive in the future.
the group s midstream natural gas projects are making good progress.
these include high-pressure natural gas pipeline joint ventures in anhui province, hebei province and hangzhou, zhejiang province; a joint venture that invests in the construction of natural gas pipelines and the exploitation of gas fields in jilin province; the guangdong liquefied natural gas receiving terminal project; and a natural gas valve station project in suzhou industrial park, suzhou, jiangsu province. these kinds of highpressure, natural gas pipeline joint ventures generate good returns and help the group develop and strengthen its downstream city-gas the group also operates water supply projects in wujiang, jiangsu province and in wuhu, anhui province, and manages an integrated water supply and wastewater joint venture in suzhou industrial park, suzhou, jiangsu province. these projects are progressing well.
the group will keep on looking for opportunities to invest in high-quality utility projects on the mainland.

coalbed methane and
eco s coalbed methane and nonconventional businesses have been developed based on the technology and operational experience gained from its landfill gas utilisation project which has been successfully operating in hong kong for several years. the north east new territories landfill gas treatment facility contributes to improving air quality, minimising the use of fossil fuels and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
since 2008, eco has been developing similar clean and projects on the mainland with an extended scope of application, the first being a phase-one coalbed methane liquefaction facility located in jincheng, shanxi province which was commissioned in late 2008.
construction of a phase-two facility was successfully completed during the year under review, and is expected to be commissioned in the first quarter of 2011. annual production capacity of the whole facility, the largest liquefaction and utilisation project of its kind on the mainland, will then increase to approximately 250 million standard cubic metres of liquefied coalbed methane which will be subsequently transported by road tankers to construction of eco s coal-mine methane liquefaction project in chongqing is progressing well; commissioning is expected in the first quarter of 2012. coal-mine gas, which typically contains about 40 per cent of methane, will be used to produce liquefied methane deploying coal-mine gas deoxidisation and coalbed methane cryogenic liquefaction technologies.
other than in-situ power generation plants, this project, with an estimated annual production capacity of 91 million standard cubic metres, is slated to become the world s first large-scale coal-mine gas utilisation facility to convert otherwise wasteful resources to fuel of high value. eco has also confirmed its investment in a second coal-mine methane deoxidisation and liquefaction project located in yangquan mining district, shanxi province to expand this business and provide the group s city-gas projects with more environmentally-friendly gas sources to help conserve energy and reduce coal resources and coal
eco started to develop coal resources and coal chemical processing businesses in 2009, focusing mainly on more environmentally-friendly and cleaner technologies for coal resources utilisation. to this end, eco s construction of a methanol production plant and development of a coal mine in junger, erdos, inner mongolia are progressing well; both are expected to be commissioned in 2011. with an annual production capacity of 200,000 tonnes, the methanol production plant has already entered the commissioning stage. eco s coking coal mining and plant project in fengcheng, jiangxi province, is also on schedule; commissioning is expected in 2012.
this project will provide an additional gas source for the group s fengcheng city-gas project. eco will continue to expand its resources reserves of both thermal coal and prime coking coal and endeavour to develop more far-sighted clean coal energy-related logistics and
eco s energy-related logistics and facilities businesses originated from its five dedicated liquefied petroleum gas filling stations in hong kong which have been operating steadily for several years servicing taxis and minibuses. eco started to develop its gas filling station business on the mainland in 2008. since then, eco has been gradually establishing a network of compressed and liquefied natural gas filling stations used by heavy-duty trucks in shaanxi, shandong, liaoning, henan and eco s aviation fuel facility in area 38, tuen mun, to service hong kong international airport, was completed and commissioned in november 2010. jetties and facilities are available for berthing tankers of 80,000 tonnes and 50,000 tonnes and unloading their aviation fuel into eight large tanks with a total capacity of 264,000 cubic metres. after re-certification, the fuel is then transported to the airport via submarine pipelines.
the facility has now become a major logistics base for supply of aviation fuel in hong kong.
