it has been an honour and a pleasure for me to serve as the chairman of hang seng over the past seven years, and i would like to thank the board and the management and staff of the bank for their many invaluable contributions and unfailing support. i would also like to wish mr smith and mr or every success in their new roles.

after a three-year salary freeze, the board approved a budget of 2.75% of total payroll for a general salary increase to staff, which took effect in january 2005.
the year ahead the economy in hong kong improved significantly as pentup demand fuelled a sharp revival in spending.
the year ahead, however, will pose a number of challenges, including slower growth in the united states and japan, continued macroeconomic controls in the mainland and rising us interest rates. for the banking industry, the major challenge will be to secure growth in the face of sustained margin pressure and intense competition.
in hong kong the economy is expected to grow steadily in 2005, underpinned by our closer economic relationship with the mainland. with hang seng s strong asset quality, sound financial position and growing wealth management capabilities, we will continue to deliver value to our shareholders and customers.
