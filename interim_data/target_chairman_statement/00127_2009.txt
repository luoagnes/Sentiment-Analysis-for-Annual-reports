(5) the prevailing hong kong dollar interest spread for placing deposit and bank borrowing has widen by 200 to 250 basis point or 2% to 2.5% per annum as compared with the market spread in the first half 2008, which implies a higher cost of negative carry in holding cash and bank balances by the group.

(7) if the final dividend and special dividend are approved by the shareholders and payment made, the cash and bank balances of the group will be reduced by such amount. in the event that the group encounters difficulties refinancing its bank borrowings in the years ahead, the company could at that time raise fund through equity issue including seeking the support from its shareholders by way of rights issue.
