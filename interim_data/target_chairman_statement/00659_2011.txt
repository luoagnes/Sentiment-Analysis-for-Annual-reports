in line with the corporate strategy in streamlining its business structure, the group announced the completion of the divestment of certain non-core service businesses through a management buyout in june 2011, which realized an exceptional gain of hk$343.9 million for the year. despite the divestment, the group still managed to enhance both profitability and margins thereby demonstrating the underlying strength of the group s core businesses and long-term competitiveness. the strong growth in fy2011 also confirms that the group has a well- established and integrated business model to maximize cash flow and ensure optimal development of growth to share the outstanding results with our shareholders, a final dividend of hk$0.33 per share was proposed, representing a payout ratio of 50.7%.

although part of the increase in aop under the roads segment was caused by the extra profit distribution of approximately hk$387.5 million in tangjin expressway (tianjin north section) and the increased revenue of guangzhou northern ring road after its partial closure for major repairs and maintenance in the preceding financial year, the overall traffic volume for most of the projects also increased in line with local economic the water segment, with its high growth rate and prospective outlook, will remain a high priority within the group s core investment. the group will continue to add new water projects to its existing portfolio.
the downturn in aop under the energy segment was mainly caused by surging fuel costs since the end of 2009. as the demand for electricity remains strong, the group will endeavour to further improve the operational efficiency of individual power plants to ensure a reasonable rate of return.
