chairman s report to unitholders distributable income for the period is hk$1,170 million, up 7.9% from 2010.
my fellow unitholders, on behalf of the board i am pleased to present champion reit s annual report for the financial year ended 31 december 2011.
as the performance of both citibank plaza and langham place has improved over the past twelve months, 2011 income and distributions have increased. profit after tax increased to hk$6,493 million for the period. excluding revaluation gains and other items that are non-cash in nature, distributable income for the period is hk$1,170 million, up 7.9% from 2010. the distribution amount, after retention of hk$66 million for future use, is hk$1,111 million. the distribution per unit ( dpu ) for the second half of the year is hk$0.1196.
combined with hk$0.1045 paid out for the first half, the total dpu for the year is hk$0.2241. this represents an increase of 3.7% from 2010. the effective distribution ratio for the year is 94.4%.
the appraised value of champion reit s properties increased 9.2% to hk$54,857 million. the trust s debt on the other hand decreased 5.5% from hk$14,879 million to hk$14,059 million because of the conversion, retirement or repurchase of various convertible bonds previously issued by the trust. as a result, the gearing ratio as of 31 december 2011 improved to 25.0% from 28.4% a year ago. net asset value improved correspondingly to hk$7.82 per unit, from hk$6.72 in december 2010 1 .
the finances of champion reit should remain stable in 2012. in may 2011, the hk$763 million in outstanding principal of our convertible bond issued in 2006 was fully repaid through internal resources while a bank loan of hk$7,000 million was refinanced for 3 years at a favourable interest rate of 0.93% p.a. above the hong kong interbank offered rate (about 0.4% currently). the floating interest rate is substantially lower than the previous fixed interest rate of 2.82% p.a. and the full year impact of interest savings from the refinancing and bond maturity will only be seen in 2012.
there is no refinancing requirement in 2012 and the next scheduled refinancing will be in may 2013 when debt secured with langham place totaling hk$7,059 million in notional principal will fall due.

1 net assets for 2010 have been restated because of new accounting standards being introduced. under the new hong kong standards, deferred taxes are no longer provided on upward revaluation of investment properties. prior to the restatement, the net asset value per unit as at 31 december 2010 was hk$6.36.

dr. lo ka shui
the liquidity in the hk dollar funding market has tightened considerably since we secured the citibank plaza refinancing, resulting in a significant increase in the interest spread. we are watching the situation closely and are exploring various avenues to secure the necessary financing ahead of time.
unless there is considerable loosening in the present tight liquidity situation, it would be likely for us to see higher costs on refinancing.
the turmoil in the world financial markets has imparted a degree of uncertainty to the prospects the hong kong markets. the income from citibank plaza will come under some downward pressure in reaction to slow office demand in central. that however should be mitigated to some extent by the rental growth at the langham place mall. the income of champion reit should therefore be relatively stable overall in 2012. we will vigilantly monitor developments in the economy and take all necessary measures on a timely basis to maintain our lo ka shui
