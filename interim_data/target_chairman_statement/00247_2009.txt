governments and other stakeholders have learned invaluable lessons from the global financial turmoil and are reviewing economic infrastructures and finding ways to improve financial systems and regulatory frameworks.
priorities include establishing better institutional monitoring and corporate governance with the aim of improving future productivity and efficiency and building resilience against unexpected shocks.
china, one of the world s largest economies, continues to grow. the central government s stimulus programme includes the acceleration of certain key infrastructure developments, and the introduction of fiscal and monetary measures as well as further developing closer economic cooperation between mainland china and hong kong. among the objectives are encouraging consumer spending, sustaining property sector and strengthening equity markets. china s ever closer ties with hong kong coupled with existing and future infrastructure networks, as well as the city s geographical advantage, will offer abundant opportunities for hong kong. easier bilateral flow of goods, services and people across the border will further benefit hong kong s economic growth. ongoing economic support by the central government will also invigorate hong kong in the international business and economic arena.
further, the improved political relationship between central government and taiwan, the three links (postal, transportation and trade) between mainland china and taiwan and the increase in cross-strait investments involving taiwan-based companies establishing their businesses in mainland china will also be positive to hong kong s future growth, as stability across the straits will benefit hong kong.
in hong kong, the various rounds of relief measures introduced by the hksar government are reviving the economy and proving conducive to weathering difficult times. among the proposed and confirmed infrastructure developments that will encourage a more stable and consistent economic environment are the hong kong-zhuhai-macao bridge and the guangzhou- shenzhen-hong kong express rail link, redevelopment and revitalisation programmes planned for various districts, the restoration of heritage buildings and tourist attractions, and a commitment to uphold the existing land and housing policy. as far as the banking system is concerned, it is reassuring to see that it remains healthy and well capitalised. financial intermediaries are important to maintain a stable financial system that allows capital to be efficiently channelled to investment and production. recent economic statistics reveal that the economic downturn has slowed with unemployment easing as well as improved market sentiment and confidence.

demand for quality housing and better standards of living remains strong in hong kong. home buying activity has been supported by liquidity in the banking sector with banks offering attractive and competitive mortgage rates and terms to buyers. marriage numbers remain at high levels and birth rates continue to rise. property transactions have picked up, with buyers interest returning as can be seen from the sales results of recent launches in the market. the property market in hong kong is experiencing a healthy growth.
we, like others, believe that crisis also presents opportunities because it leads to more focused efforts and stronger teamwork to improve productivity and operational efficiency. despite the current economic situation, we face these challenges with confidence as we move forward. the group continues to be prudently positioned to benefit from future opportunities that will arise, and will strive to optimise its earnings, improve the quality of our products and services, and enhance customers lifestyles which will ultimately lead us to serve our customers better. as sino land has a strong financial position with good liquidity, management will continue to deliver value for shareholders.
sino land will maintain a policy of selectively and continuously replenishing its land bank both in hong kong and china, which will enable it to strengthen earnings and profitability. the directors are confident in the medium to long term prospects of the group.
