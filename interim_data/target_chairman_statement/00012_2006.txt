henderson cyber limited the company, henderson investment, hong kong and china gas and henderson cyber jointly announced in august 2005 the privatisation proposal of henderson cyber by henderson investment and hong kong and china gas by way of a scheme of arrangement involving the cancellation and extinguishment of the scheme shares in henderson cyber at the cancellation price of hk$0.42 in cash per scheme share. the scheme was approved by a majority of 99.96% of the independent shareholders present and voting at the court meeting. the scheme took effect in december 2005 and the listing of the shares in henderson cyber on the growth enterprise market of the stock exchange of hong kong limited was withdrawn. upon completion of the privatisation, henderson investment s interest in henderson cyber was increased to approximately 78.69%, with the balance of 21.31% held by the hong kong and china gas company limited. the aggregate amount of cancellation price paid by henderson investment was henderson investment limited the company made a second attempt to privatise henderson investment in november 2005, following an unsuccessful privatisation effort in november 2002 ( the 2002 exercise ). as announced in december 2005, the cancellation consideration was increased to one share in the company in exchange for every 2.5 scheme shares in henderson investment. in order for the proposal to succeed, the scheme should not be disapproved by more than 10% in value of all the shares held by independent minority shareholders of henderson investment (the 10% threshold ).
at the court meeting held on 20 january 2006, a majority of up to 85.7% (as compared with 85.6% in the 2002 exercise) of the independent minority shareholders of henderson investment present voted in favour of the privatisation proposal. however, since the votes that were cast against the scheme marginally exceeded the 10% threshold a repeat of the 2002 exercise, the scheme could not take effect and hence lapsed. it is regrettable that, despite the majority support of independent minority shareholders of henderson investment on both occasions, the privatisation proposal on each occasion fell through by the narrowest of margin under the the group has always adhered to sound and prudent financial management principles. at the year end, the group maintained a gearing ratio of net bank borrowings to shareholders funds of 16.7%. the group does not make use of any derivative instruments for speculative purposes. apart from its investments in china which are denominated in renminbi and are not hedged, the group had no other material open foreign exchange positions at the financial shortly after the end of the financial year under review, the group capitalized on the favourable loan market conditions by concluding a hk$13.35 billion syndicated credit facility of five years in tenor at an extremely attractive interest margin. this financing transaction, which takes the form of a revolving credit facility, set the record in the local syndicated loan market as being the largest in transaction size for private sector borrowings ever raised in hong kong dollars and offers optimal flexibility for the general corporate funding purposes of the group. a syndicate of 24 international banks as well as local banks originating from ten countries in all participated in this credit facility. the successful arrangement of the facility fully demonstrates the support and confidence that the banking community has placed in the group.

looking ahead, with the increasing number of mainland enterprises listed in hong kong, substantial capital flows will be drawn to the territory, thereby providing a boost to the finance sector. financial institutions, as well as their supporting service providers, are expected to further expand their businesses. together with the improving job market and the continued increase in inbound tourists, these factors will underpin growth in the hong kong economy.
given the improving market conditions, both volume and price for residential property sales will pick up gradually. following the recent successful marketing of grand waterfront, the group plans to embark on the sales launch of a number of development projects, including the beverly hills at tai po town lot no. 161, centreplace at no. 1 high street, the sherwood at fuk hang tsuen road, lam tei, tuen mun, 500-502 tung chau street, 33 lai chi kok road and 50 tan kwai tsuen at yuen long. the sale of these projects and of the stock of property units will result in a significant increase in buoyant consumer confidence will continue to underpin retail spending and hence rental growth for shopping centres. the office market is expected to perform well on the back of tight supply being met by keen demand from companies looking for expansion opportunities. the continuing increase in expatriate inflow to hong kong will continue to fuel the residential market and sustain promising growth in rental rates. rental income from both new lettings and renewals is expected to rise.
the group has many new office and industrial properties in the pipeline providing some 1.7 million square feet in gross floor area.
notably among these projects is nos. 223 231 wai yip street, an office development in kwun tong boasting a gross floor area of over 1.0 million square feet. upon completion by the fourth quarter of 2007, it will become the landmark development in kowloon east and bring significant return to the group.
a series of recent macroeconomic control measures implemented in china were aimed at preventing the property sector from overheating. the group expects the impact of these developments on its china business overall to be negligible as the group is a long term investor. in the long run, these measures will benefit the property sector by ensuring a healthier business environment, which would foster the group s business growth in mainland china as well. the group s site at li wan district, guangzhou will be launched shortly. preliminary works for the projects in xingsha town, changsha and xuzhou new town have already commenced which will provide a total residential floor area of about 16 million square feet in addition to commercial facilities. the three sizeable property development projects in beijing and shanghai will add 4.13 million square feet of rental space, making a total of 6.77 million square feet in gross floor area for the group s investment property portfolio in mainland china. contribution from the mainland business is thus expected to increase substantially.
with a sizeable land bank in hong kong and increasing coverage across the major cities in mainland china, ample liquidity and a dedicated and experienced team, the group is confident of the future.
in the absence of unforeseen circumstances, performance of the group will show satisfactory growth in the coming financial year.

executive directors mr. ho wing fun and mr. leung sing stepped down from the board on retirement during the year. i would like to thank them most sincerely for their long years of loyal service and immense contributions to the group.
i would also like to take this opportunity to thank the directors for their wise counsel and support, and the management and staff at all levels for their dedication, hard work and contributions in the past year. i know i can continue to count on them in our quest to deliver value to our shareholders.
