on behalf of the board of directors and all of our employees, i would like to express my sincere gratitude to everyone who helped to make this achievement possible.
the complex and turbulent political and economic environment worldwide in 2011 saw global crude oil prices remain high and volatile.
rising domestic inflationary pressure and continuing price controls on oil products in our home market generated immense challenges for our business. the board of directors worked diligently to assess and respond to these challenges in pursuing the group s development plans and remaining declicated to our goal of building a world-class energy and petrochemical company. the board has this year adjusted and refined the company s business strategies for resources, marketing, integration and internationalisation, and has added new strategic objectives for differentiation and low- carbon development. we will leverage of our competitive advantages and our proficiency in innovation to build a resource-saving and environmentally responsible enterprise, which will sustain the company s growth for many years to come.
in 2011, sinopec s management, together with its employees, continued to review the company s processes in an effort to increase efficiency, ensure safe production, and improve energy savings and reduce emissions. as a result, we achieved the best performance in our history. our reserves and production grew steadily throughout the year, and we made an initial breakthrough in the exploration and production of unconventional oil and gas. we also increased both our refining capacity and throughput, leading to major gains in our competitiveness in this area. our chemical business achieved record profitability, with a significant rise in both production and revenue.
sales of refined oil products once again grew robustly, and we continued to optimise the balance between production and sales, with retail volumes surpassing 100 million tonnes for the first time. alongside this, our non-fuel business grew at a rapid pace. enjoying the benefits of our vertically integrated business model, sinopec made significant advances in scientific and technological innovation, and we supported our production capabilities with excellence in marketing and research. in the course of seeking new paths for growth, we made great strides in optimising our operations in resources, products and services, promoting the production of clean energy and in conducting r&d for alternative and new at the same time, we played a central role in maintaining stable market supply, and fulfilled our corporate social responsibility. we also implemented company-wide management protocols for health, safety and environment (hse). furthermore, we showed our commitment to the communities where we have a presence through our active involvement in numerous charitable endeavors. we are also proud that, in addition to championing sustainable development in our business and promoting that in the wider economy and community, we take good care of our in 2011, the company s total revenues and other operating income amounted to rmb 2,505.7 billion, an increase of 31% from 2010, while profits attributable to shareholders in accordance with international financial reporting standards were rmb 73.225 billion, an increase of 2.0% from the previous year. the company s domestic and overseas share price significantly outperformed the markets and our peers, yielding remarkable returns for our shareholders. the board of directors recommended a final dividend of rmb 0.20 per share, which when combined with the interim dividend of rmb 0.10 per share brings the total annual dividend for 2011 to rmb 0.30 per share, an increase by 43% over the the global economy in 2012 continues to face serious challenges, and in light of complex geopolitical tensions, international oil prices are expected to remain high. with domestic economic growth facing downward pressure, the growth in demand for refining and chemical products is expected to ease. we are, however, confident that with the continuing focus of the chinese government on economic development and stability, along with the effects of ongoing domestic industrialisation and urbanisation, the demand for energy and chemical products will continue to grow. we also believe that our established presence and competitive edge put us in a strong position to maintain in the years ahead, we will continue to integrate cutting-edge developments in science and technology into our operations, and we will implement our strategic focus on resources, marketing, integration, internationalisation, differentiation and low-carbon development.
