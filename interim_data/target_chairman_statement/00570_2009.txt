after a year of remarkable growth in 2007, the pharmaceutical industry in china is delivering another impeccable performance during the year under review. revenue of the pharmaceutical manufacturing sector rose over 25% while its total profi t also jumped by over 25% during january to november 2008 compared with the corresponding period in 2007, according to national bureau of statistics of china.
mr. wen jiabao, the china premier, said in january 2009 that china will strive to improve the country s healthcare system to make healthcare more accessible and affordable. the central government published a long awaited medical reform plan on 6 april 2009 which promised to spend rmb850 billion by 2011 to provide universal medical to the country s 1.3 billion population. the principle of the reform is to establish a healthcare system that provides safe, effective, convenient and low cost public health and basic medical services for all urban and rural residents. more specifi cally, the reform will expand the coverage of medical insurance, increase the amount of rural and urban population covered by the basic medical insurance system or the new rural cooperative medical system to at least 90 percent by 2011 and build a basic medicine system that includes a catalogue of drugs that mostly needed by the public.

outlook and strategies the board is confi dent that the pharmaceutical industry will grow steadily with the prc government s favorable policies in 2009 and years ahead as the government has a plan to invest rmb850 billion in the new reform of the pharmaceutical system in prc. this investment, which will mostly be used as the government s subsidies for the new rural cooperative pharmaceutical service and urban residents insurance, is expected to greatly increase the market volume of the pharmaceutical industry in prc. the industry will be entering its rapid development stage in the domestic market in the next after the acquisition mentioned above, the group has now 4 manufacturing subsidiaries operating with different brand names and sales network, producing different product lines.
with a view to achieving maximum economic benefit and overall operation effi ciency, we will adopt the consolidation and growth strategies as follows: 1. enrich core product portfolio we will increase sales and marketing efforts on several emerging high value-added products which are proved to be more effective than similar products and have more market potentials. some of these products are the unique products of the group, therefore we can review and formulate pricing strategy according to market acceptance and preference. we will also place more resources on research and development to broaden our product line in order to improve our gross profi t margin and alleviate the concentration risk of reliance on the group s existing key products.
2. step up sales network construction and we will rationalize and consolidate the sales network of the group s subsidiaries, which mainly covers southern china region, northern china region and affl uent coastal cities at the moment. with the government s subsidies for hospitals in rural areas and health care system, the demand for basic pharmaceutical products, particularly modern chinese medicines, is likely to rise. we will respond to the market change with the implementation of a step by step penetration program fkpqs r , in which we will commit considerable effort to expanding its existing market, particularly, the second-tier and third-tier cities and the end market in rural areas. we will also integrate our resources to fortify our partnership with strategic distributors to strengthen our distribution network, and further increase our market coverage and 3. integrate internal resources with three of the group s subsidiaries located in foshan city, we plan to establish a unifi ed purchase platform to lower purchase cost through scale advantage, and assure the quality of the raw materials. we will also rearrange and make full use of the current human resources, especially the marketing personnel to support the group s consolidation and lower relevant cost, and through the sharing of production techniques of the subsidiaries, we strive to achieve cost effectiveness and product quality.
moreover, we will establish a unifi ed settlement platform to promote effi ciency of the group s internal management system and monitor the execution and the use of expenditure. with this settlement platform, we will improve the group s cash management so as to reduce fi nance cost and make prompt actions in dealing with the group s outlook and strategies (continued) 4. ensure quality and safety of products with our core value which is with integrity and responsibility, we offer people products of quality _(w -n p'y>w , we will strengthen our quality control management by upgrading our equipment, improving our production skills and quality control procedures, so as to ensure compliance with the requirements of gmp and the quality and safety of our products.
5. focus on risk management integration of resources is vital for the success of the group as it brings great benefi t to the group. however, it s a complex process because of different business model and management culture of the subsidiaries, so there might be integration risk. besides, with the economic crisis continues to unfold, there might be delay in settlement of receivables from our major customers, this will increase the group s credit risk. furthermore, the chinese government has strengthened its monitoring and regulatory control on pharmaceutical industry in terms of drug regulation, quality assurance and environmental protection. all these will post challenge to our risk management. we will allocate more resources to evaluate and monitor these risks with appropriate internal control procedures, so that we can adapt swiftly to the market change and enhance our core competence, thus ensuring sustainable growth and the investment value of the 6. seize on merger and acquisition opportunities we believe that consolidation will continue to be the trend of the pharmaceutical industry due to the implementation of the new healthcare reform. with our management team s in-depth knowledge of the local market, we will consider any new merger and acquisition opportunities that will contribute to the group in terms of brand names, sales network, products and research and development.
as a large scale modern pharmaceutical manufacturer, the group seized on the chance of expanding its market in 2008 to actively develop its current business, invest more resources to increase its production capacity, and improve the quality of products. we are heading towards a new goal in the year of 2009. facing the new challenges and opportunities ahead, the board aims to grab every opportunity of pharmaceutical industry integration to focus on the research and development of products, accelerate the establishment of the marketing team, and increase the market share of our products. the board believes that through the above mentioned strategies, the group will be able to grow in a sustainable way and bring a greater return to the shareholders.
