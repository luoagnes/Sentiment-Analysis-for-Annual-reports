diversified for future growth today, lenovo is a bigger and more diverse company than ever thanks not only to strong organic growth, but also due to the successful completion of two historic acquisitions in the last fiscal year. the acquisitions of both the system x server business from ibm and then motorola from google immediately made lenovo a significantly stronger global player in both x86 servers and smartphones. more importantly, lenovo now has three major growth engines pc, enterprise and mobile.
the strengthening of new growth engines makes lenovo s business significantly more balanced. a year ago, more than 80% of lenovo s revenue came from pcs; now, even with record pc performance, this segment is only 63% of our new business. not only is lenovo less reliant on one particular business, but we are now able to attack growth opportunities across the full spectrum of personal technology products.
our business today is more diverse not only in terms of products, but also in terms of in the 10 years since lenovo made another historic deal acquiring ibm s pc division we have proven we know how to not only integrate acquisitions, but also how to strengthen and grow these new businesses. just as we built the pc business from #3 a decade ago to #1 today, our expectation is to grow these new businesses to compete with the world leaders.
we will accomplish in the same way we have built lenovo in the last six years: by attacking to gain share while building from our foundation of strengths.
