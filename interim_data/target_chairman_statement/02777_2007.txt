a growing land bank as a developer with foresight and vision, we recognize that having sufficient land at reasonable cost is the key to our success. with a total land bank of 17.89 million sq.m., we are capable of meeting the needs of our four-to-five year development pipeline. however, to reach new levels of growth, we have been dedicating substantial resources towards acquiring new land.
since our listing on the stock exchange of hong kong on 14 july 2005, we have worked steadily to increase our land bank. the past year was no exception. in 2006, we acquired 21 pieces of land for the development of 19 projects. in tianjin, we purchased three prime sites, one of which was next to our existing project, tianjin r&f city. all of these sites, representing a total gfa of 963,000 sq.m., will serve as the foundation for our future business growth in that city.
during the year we also obtained a number of sites in chongqing with a total gfa of 7.39 million sq.m. for the development of three major projects. one of these project, known as chongqing r&f city, will be our first flagship project in the city.
with a population of 30 million, chongqing is the largest city in china and it is a municipality under the direct administration of the state council. we believe it has great potential for the future, especially in light of the government s go west policy of encouraging economic development in china s western region.
we will continue to build up our land bank and deliver high quality products at competitive prices.

as a leader in the property development sector, we have the experience, the resources and the ability to supply a wider range of products at prices that the average chinese family can afford. this will not only help chinese people realize their dreams of owning a home, but will also benefit the country as a whole.
a reputation built on quality we have established a reputation of delivering high quality products to our customers on time and providing excellent after-sales service.
in doing so, we have been able to deliver consistent results for our investors each year.

we understand, however, that it is also important for us to diversify a balanced portfolio.
for this reason, we have begun developing commercial properties, such as shopping malls, hotels and office buildings. our target within the next five years is to build a portfolio of investment properties that generate a steady source of recurrent rental income.
during the year we made excellent progress in our diversification strategy, as we embarked on projects for use as office buildings, shopping malls, service apartments and hotels. a selected portion of these projects will be retained as investment properties for the development of residential property, however, will remain our primary business.
setting new sights in the years ahead, china will remain one of the world s most attractive destinations for investment as the economy continues to boom. we believe that the property sector will move in the same direction, as property has traditionally always performed well in a high-growth economy.
the group is well positioned to benefit from this trend, given our experience in the industry, business focus and knowledge of local markets.
