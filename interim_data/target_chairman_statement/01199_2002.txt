2001 marked the beginning of the 21st century with utmost significance. the world was focusing on china s entry into the world trade organisation ( wto ) and the success of beijing, the capital of china, to host the olympics 2008.
these two exciting events will have far-reaching positive impact on global economic development in the 21st century.
in recent years, shipping companies have been expanding their cargo transportation capacities in order to meet the expected increase in service demand. by 2001, new vessels were ready to be put into operation. however, the 9.11 event which abruptly took place in new york has caused serious deterioration in the u.s. economy. the recovery of global economy was dragged down. as a result of the global economic slowdown during the year, major industries around the world encountered a more difficult operating environment. these structural factors inevitably affected cosco pacific. at the same time, the company s core businesses were also affected in their further developments given the interrelationships between them and the demand for despite the unfavourable operating environment, the group s overall results and operations were satisfactory in 2001. this can be attributed to the hard work of all staff, the support of the sister companies in cosco, and the mutual assistance from the business partners. on behalf of the directors, i would like to extend our most sincere thanks to all of them.

although china is expected to face more challenges and external uncertainties in 2002, i remain optimistic towards the country s economic prospects.
the positive effects from china s wto membership will become increasingly apparent. on the external front, china is seen as having the highest growth potential among world countries and a relatively safer market for investment. it is expected that global capital flow to china will substantially increase in the coming years. internally, the chinese government is taking measures to build up an efficient financial system and healthy capital markets in order to provide financing channels and capital for the chinese enterprises and to increase their competitiveness. these factors will facilitate the growth of the chinese economy.
china s capital markets will gradually open up, which will provide enormous opportunities for chinese enterprises. in particular, the growth in china trade will be a major driving force to the development of the logistics industry.
