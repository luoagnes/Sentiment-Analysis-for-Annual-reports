2015 was a tough year on all fronts for hong kong. the global economy had entered an era of low growth. developed economies remained stagnant and emerging economies were slowing down. interest rate hike in the u.s., currency instability, as well as the reform in transition in china further clouded the global economic outlook.
china s economy grew by 6.9% in 2015, its slackest pace in a quarter century, underlining a new normal of slower but high-quality growth for a more sustainable and environmentally friendly development. a structural transition towards services and consumption was making good headway as consumer spending contributed 66% of gdp growth, the biggest contribution since 2001. for the f rst time, a booming services sector accounted for over half of the economy, climbing to 50.5%. in the property market, against the backdrop of a slowing economy, a string of easing measures stimulated buying activities. however, it would be prudent to plan on a slower-growth china as the substantial catch up phase of china s development has concluded several years ago.
in hong kong, the economy recorded a modest 2.4% growth rate in 2015. an increase in outbound travels by locals and a decrease in tourist arrivals, caused principally by a strong hong kong dollar, combined to cast a further shadow on the bumpy retail and hospitality sectors. the perceptions of an unwelcoming or even unsafe hong kong, which worried some travellers, have worsened the situation. as a result, total visitor arrivals decreased by 2.5% to 59.3 million and total retail sales dropped by 3.7% to hk$475.2 billion. some have described the market as facing its worst retail woes since the 1997 f nancial crisis.

harbour city remains a global retail landmark and one of the most coveted destinations for top brands. its unique positioning as an international showcase in the region attracted new and sought-after brands. we continued to improve retail offer with the most differentiating and aspirational brands and dedicated special efforts in spicing up our culinary offerings to bring surprises and enjoyment to visitors. a series of value-accretive initiatives are underway, including the 4-storey extension building at ocean terminal, and they are set to enhance the competitive edge of the one-stop shopping mecca.

china retail is a pillar of the group s new engine for revenue and valuation growth. times outlet and ifs complex in chengdu showed continued strength and the retail-oriented ifs complexes in chongqing and changsha are poised to tap strong experience-oriented consumption in the years to come. ideally located at the heart of their respective core cbd, chengdu ifs and changsha ifs are set to match harbour city and times square in scale and market positioning.

we are honoured to be recognised by the community for our effort in community investment. our long-standing mission of building for tomorrow creates a solid pathway to corporate social responsibility (csr). with our business-in-community initiatives, we adopt a long-term vision in generating positive impact and lasting value to the wharf (holdings) limited | annual report 2015 project wecan is designed to provide assistance to the underprivileged students in society. launched in 2011, it has scaled up to serve a total of 50 less advantageous secondary schools, supporting over 42,000 deserving students in hong kong. a wide variety of activities have been organised to nurture students conf dence and inspire them to pursue higher studies and fulf lling careers. a joint annual school event young innovators bazaar was held in january at plaza hollywood, where 500 students from 25 project wecan participating schools gained f rst hand experience in setting up and running their own businesses for a few days. company visits, job-tasting and other career development opportunities, as well as a host of summer programmes, were also organized to help the students create meaningful life. on top of that, a joint school teachers development day was held to offer more all-rounded support to more than 2,600 teachers and headmasters from 50 partner schools who attended the event.

the wharf hong kong secondary school art competition has continued to raise public awareness on art and culture as well as to cultivate home-grown young talents. the top 18 finalists are eligible to apply for the wharf art scholarship to pursue further studies in art-related bachelor programmes in local and overseas universities.
for the past four years since the scholarship is available, nine have been fully funded to pursue art and design related studies in top notch universities.

we also published our f rst standalone csr report in accordance with the internationally recognised guidelines global reporting initiative (gri). the report covers the economic, environmental and social performances across the group s major businesses in hong kong.

an uneven recovery, the divergence in monetary policy instilling more volatile fund flows, weak oil prices and interest rate hikes are adding to uncertainties over the global economic outlook in 2016. it is important to stay alert to "competitive devaluation" as this would result in the pie getting smaller. the u.s. and china need to take leadership to steer other nations to avoid that trap. as quantitative easing phases out in the u.s., a gradual move towards suitable f scal stimulus is the direction the world needs.
the second largest economy in the world at our door step will continue to buttress hong kong. china pledged to maintain an annual gdp growth of at least 6.5% and to create a moderately prosperous society by 2020 in its latest f ve-year plan (2016 2020). while china is moving towards a domestically and market-driven model, the new normal will bring both new challenges and risks. that said, a healthier domestic market will usher in new sources of growth, putting china on a more competitive trajectory. across a range of issues, the commitment to double per-capita income by 2020 over 2010 levels will accelerate urbanization and wealth accumulation for coming decades. hong kong is the world s leading super service platform, hitting the sweet spot on needs in china brought by urbanization, service sector intensif cation and consumerism. the group is well poised to tap these opportunities.

the wharf (holdings) limited | annual report 2015 back in hong kong, the local economy is projected to expand by 1 2% in 2016 and by 3% per annum from 2017 to 2020. in the near term, hong kong s retail and hospitality industries may remain weak but the government is allocating funding and taking additional initiatives to resuscitate the f agging tourism industry. construction of the hong kong-zhuhai-macau bridge is underway, which will foster closer co-operation among the three places and stimulate economic activities for our retail and personal services platform.
the substantial devaluation of the yen and the euro in recent years is hurting hong kong and particularly its retail sector. international brands are making product price adjustments and the process continues. nobody sees this as a permanent structural situation.
furthermore, our proven management and execution track record provide conf dence to our tenants, shoppers and investors, offering consistencies and productivity by our destination and well-located properties. this is manifested in positive lease renewals which add to the traction and continuing demand, keeping our showcase status resilient.
on behalf of all shareholders and my fellow directors, i wish to pay special tribute to all staff for their high levels of dedication, professionalism and contribution throughout the year.
wharf has successfully weathered cycles in the past. i am immensely grateful to mr woo for the solid foundation he has laid for the group. we have remarkable assets in unique and prime locations, a seasoned management team, and dedicated and professional staff. i have worked with them for many years and have every conf dence the group will continue to rise to the challenge.
