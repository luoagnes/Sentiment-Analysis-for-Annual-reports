with the business operations running smoothly in jeju, the group considers the current timing to be opportune for expanding and diversifying operations beyond the asia market. in december 2015, the group announced its winning of the bid for les ambassadeurs club located in london s upscale mayfair district, symbolizing the group s further expansion of its global presence. les ambassadeurs club is operated pursuant to operating licenses and a casino premises license issued under the gambling act 2005 by the city of westminster. with 200 years of history, the club has established itself as a major social landmark for prominent clientele from london and around the world since its inception during the 19th century.
the club claims an international customer base composed mainly of ultra- high net worth individuals. the group believes that given the maturity of the casino business in and sound legal system of the united kingdom, coupled with les ambassadeurs club s prime location, a loyal customer base in europe and the middle east as well as experienced management, the acquisition of the club represents a unique and good investment opportunity that would allow the group to lay a solid foundation in its business development in overseas markets.
in order to focus on its core gaming business, the group disposed its wholly-owned subsidiary double earn holdings limited, which was principally engaged in the development of residential properties at yueyang, the hunan province, the prc, for a total consideration of hk$1 billion. the disposal allowed the group to recoup not only in full the entire cash investment but also enjoy a net cash inflow, allowing the group to redeploy its resources to its existing and other potential investments in line with the group s long-term business strategy. moreover, the disposal minimized the group s exposure to the market risks resulted from any downturn in the property market due to fluctuation of the financial markets and the frequent changes in the property control policies in china.
during the year, the group was able to achieve a breakthrough in marketing development, business restructuring and internal operations management. i would like to express my heartfelt appreciation to all our partners and investors for their ongoing support, and to our employees for their dedication and contribution. i truly hope that we will continue to work together towards the ultimate goal of bringing the business and prosperity of the group to the next level.
2015 marked a period of uncertainty in the global economic environment due to factors such as the volatility of international oil prices and the stock market of the prc and hong kong, sparking sentiments of cautiousness in the global investment environment. nonetheless, china, as one of the world s leading economies with a massive population of 1.4 billion people, is still able to maintain considerable economic growth and growing spending power led by urbanization each year. as chinese tourists increasingly discover more and more foreign tourist destinations, they are no longer satisfied with simple and traditional gaming services. instead, they are progressively turning towards pursuing an experience that combines shopping, dining, gaming and business that can only be provided by a world-class integrated entertainment resort. landing international believes that there are still many destinations in the world with high potential for developing the aforementioned resorts, and will continuously explore suitable investment opportunities in the international market. enrichment of the business portfolio, achievement of optimal synergy, and thoughtful construction of each and every ongoing and planned project all come together to establish landing as a world-class brand in the gaming and entertainment industry. we will strive not only to offer novel travel experiences for our customers, but also generate the best returns for our chairman and executive director
