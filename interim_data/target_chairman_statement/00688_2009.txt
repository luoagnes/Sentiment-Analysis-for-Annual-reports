the group strives to improve corporate governance standards in order to protect the interests of all the group s stakeholders. the board recognises its prime duty is to protect and best utilise resources in the group and to enhance shareholder value. good corporate governance is the key to improving corporate profi t and enhancing sustainable development. the board strives to strike a balance between compliance with rules and regulations and fl exibility in doing business, and the interests of the controlling shareholder and minority shareholders. in the past year, the group has done its best to promote corporate transparency, to enhance the effi ciency of the board and the various committees under the board, and to improve the group s internal controls and risk management. the strategy and risk management department was established in july 2008 to enhance the group s capability in risk management. to improve communication with investors, starting from july 2007 the group has released monthly data on sales and its land bank in china. the annual report is one of the major tools for communication with investors, and the group continues to improve its quality. the 2007 annual report was recognised in the renowned international arc awards and mercury awards. this demonstrates the group s achievements in its communications with investors.

the group places great emphasis on its corporate social responsibilities and is active in social and charitable activities. the group pays attention to environmental, arts and staff development issues, and strives to maintain a culture for the corporation that fully serves its shareholders, business associates, staff members and the community.

subsequent to the sichuan earthquake, the group accelerated and increased the zhong hai hope school programme.
the construction of two new china overseas hope schools and the building of the du jiang yan special education school were both started in 2008.
in the course of developing a property project, at the design stage and during construction, great emphasis is placed on environmental protection and safety. the group will do its best to build a greener community. as a property developer, the group can make a major contribution towards the economy, infrastructure development, environmental enhancement and provision of job opportunities in urban areas.

the negative impact of the global fi nancial crisis on the world economy will be more evident in 2009. major developed countries including usa, uk and japan have entered into recession. the economies of emerging markets, including china, will also be heavily affected. governments in many countries have developed stimulus measures aimed at boosting credit liquidity in the fi nancial markets, stimulating consumption and fi nally regaining economic momentum, but it will take a while for these measures to take effect. in the second half of 2008, china made major adjustments to its macro- control policies by adopting active fi scal policies and moderately loose monetary policies, aiming to maintain steady economic growth, mainly by increasing domestic demand. the global fi nancial crisis has also badly hurt the economies of hong kong and macau, and both entered into recession in 2009. in response the respective governments have launched various stimulus packages.
it is estimated that this fi nancial crisis will have a long and deep impact on the world economy and fi nancial markets and that most enterprises will face tremendous challenges in 2009.
in such tough operating conditions, the group will strive to maintain healthy development, and at the same time will continue to improve its corporate governance standards and to actively take up more corporate social responsibility.

after rapid growth for so many years, the china economy has slowed down due to the impact of the global fi nancial crisis. under the government s proactive fi scal policies and moderately loose monetary policies, the stimulus package comprising interest rate cuts, tax rebates, tax cuts and mortgage interest rate reductions will be benefi cial for the recovery and development of the property market in china. the group is confi dent about the long-term development of the mainland china property market, though in 2009 it will follow a pattern of survival of the fi ttest and elimination of the weakest . property developers with strong brand names, scale, adequate fi nancial resources and effective management will have opportunities to enlarge their development scale, increase their land banks, accelerate their rate of development and expand their market shares.
it is expected that the property markets in hong kong and macau, especially the high-end segment, will be under continued pressure. in 2009, the group will concentrate on developing the two current projects and actively procure the completion of the land premium compensation work for the fan ling project.
market leading status china is a vast country whose economy is developing at varying rates, and its property markets are also at various stages at any one time. however, comprehensive nationwide strategic coverage enables the group to balance risks caused by volatility in economic and market cycles. the group will continue to excel and balance its nationwide development strategy by actively exploring new markets with strong potential. this will help to increase its leadership of the industry in terms of turnover, net profi t and brand value. in this way the reputation of the group as a market leader in the high-end market will be enhanced. the group will adhere to its professionalism and strive to maintain its philosophy of attention to detail to deliver outstanding quality and value-for-money products and services, in order to consolidate its status as sustainable project development with the market turnover in china slowing and prices falling, the group will control the pace of its development appropriately and launch scarce, highly differentiated and top-quality products. by fully utilising the strength of its brand name, backed by additional marketing and sales resources, the group can improve its cash fl ow and maximise the return on its assets. after taking into consideration the economic conditions, market trends and the group s situation, it is planned that in 2009 forty-three projects with gfa of 5.0 million sq m will be completed for occupation. the group will aim to achieve total sales area of not less than 3.5 million sq m for 2009, an increase of 30% on 2008.
better business structure the group will continue to strengthen the competitiveness of its business structure with residential development as the main element and investment property in a supplemental role. it will balance resources allocation for short-term and long-term investment and gradually increase its weighting on investment property so as to obtain stable long-term returns. a professional investment property team has been steadily built up to ensure stable growth of income from investment property and enhancement in the value of investment properties, thus strengthening its capability to balance market risk. the group will strive to generate a profi t contribution from investment property that exceeds 20% of the total profi t by 2010. the completion of the beijing china overseas plaza has added more than 150,000 sq m of investment property to the group, and currently the commercial property area being developed and yet to be developed exceeds 1.2 million sq m, with most to be completed by the end of 2011.
withdrawal from infrastructure business the group has disposed of all its infrastructure investment businesses except for the nanjing yangtze river ii bridge. in 2008, the group successfully sold the nanchang bridge and laizhou port for a total sum of hk$1.53 billion. the group will look for the best timing to dispose of the nanjing yangtze river ii bridge in the most appropriate way.

under less favourable macroeconomic conditions, the group will calmly meet the challenges ahead. it will maintain an appropriate scale of investment, monitor the pace of its development and maintain a reasonable gearing ratio. to capture opportunities offered by market adjustments, the group will enter into projects with good earning prospects, government support, moderate fi nancial requirement and high cash turnover rate, either by public auction or merger and acquisition.
the group will also enhance cooperation with large state-owned enterprises to acquire new land resources at relatively lower funding levels. subject to the improvement in the fi nancial position of the group, it is intended that the replenishment of land for development for 2009 will not be less than 4 million sq m.

many property developers will face severe sales pressure and funding defi ciencies amid the fi nancial crisis. under such depressed market conditions, merger and acquisition opportunities will arise. the group will strive to make real progress in the setting up of a real estate fund and also in merger and acquisition activities so as to expedite its development and expand its development scale.

facing such a tough economic and operating environment, and in order to meet the challenges and seize the opportunities, the group needs to enhance its overall capabilities including its competitiveness and risk control capability.
the group will continue to focus on policies and regulations, resource protection, risk management and operating effi ciency enhancement. the last can be achieved through actively acquiring high-value land reserves at low cost, continued improvement of product quality and reduction of costs and expenses in project development, sales and prudent financial management the fi nancial crisis poses various challenges, creating unprecedented pressure on fi nancial and funds management in every corporation. the group will continue to adhere to prudent fi nancial management while it strives to improve its funds management capability. the group will make full use of its fund-raising platforms in the international, hong kong and mainland china fi nancial markets, exploring new channels to enhance its fi nancial strength and resources and to increase its asset protection capabilities. the open offer announced by the group on 10 december 2008 gained support from the group s controlling shareholder, china overseas holdings limited, who agreed to underwrite the whole open offer. the open offer was heavily oversubscribed and hk$2.5 billion in equity was raised in february 2009. after the open offer, the shareholder equity of the group was increased to over hk$35 billion and the gearing ratio was decreased to about 40%. the group is indeed the mainland china property developer with the strongest fi nancial capabilities, with little debt repayment pressure due to the fact that most of its bank loans and guarantee bills are long term with maturity falling after 2010. the group will continue to upgrade and promote its erp system to enhance project and fi nancial information communication, intensify cash fl ow control for all regions, increase cash infl ow and effectively combat the risks brought about by any shortage in liquidity.
prudent fi nancial management and strong fi nancial capabilities can enable the group to handle the fi nancial crisis and position itself to seize business opportunities.

the board is confi dent about prospects for the group. in the last few years, the group has diligently built a solid foundation, and has stepped up to new heights as an evergreen enterprise. strong, persistent profi t growth has continued for six consecutive years, and excellent share price performance demonstrates the group s strength and capability. this year, 2009, will be full of opportunities and challenges. the group will continue to operate according to its long-standing maxim of exercise caution in details and implementation. build a strong foundation to seek greater success . through its hard work and persistent innovation and by continually enhancing its operating and management capability, the group is fully confi dent of its performance in 2009. furthermore, with its solid foundation, international vision and exposure, appropriate nationwide development strategy plus excellent brand name and fi nancial strength, the group is capable of converting crisis to opportunity and pressure to dynamism. the group is very confi dent that it can maintain its leadership position in the china real estate industry and achieve steady high-quality balanced growth.
