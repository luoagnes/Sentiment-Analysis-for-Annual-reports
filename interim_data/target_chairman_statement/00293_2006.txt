chairman s letter the cathay pacific group has recorded a profit attributable to shareholders of hk$3,298 million for 2005, compared with a profit of hk$4,417 million in 2004, although turnover increased by 19.1% to a record hk$50,909 million.
continuing high fuel prices were the principal cause behind this disappointing result, with the escalating cost of fuel producing a reduced profit in the second half of the year, which is traditionally the much stronger period. for the full year, fuel expenditure increased by 67.2% to hk$15,588 million, with fuel surcharges on tickets only partially offsetting the additional cost.
our unit cost excluding fuel fell 1.9% as we continued to increase productivity and reduce controllable overheads.passenger revenue increased 14.6% to a record of hk$30,274 million. we carried 15.4 million passengers in 2005, up by 1.8 million on the previous year. yield increased 1.1% to hk46.3, with strong demand from first and business class passengers. with the addition of new aircraft and services, our passenger capacity increased by 11.8%.
during the year, cathay pacific launched a third daily service to los angeles, a fourth daily service to london, and increased frequencies to amsterdam, beijing, ho chi minh city, johannesburg, nagoya, perth, seoul and singapore. we also commenced a three-times-weekly service to xiamen and a codeshare service with air china to beijing.
the airline carried a record 1,118,047 tonnes of freight, mainly as a result of additional capacity and transshipment cargo to and from shanghai, and set a cargo revenue record of hk$11,585 million. however, both yield and load factor decreased to hk$1.75 and 67.0% respectively due to increased competition and a slowdown in the growth of exports from south china.
in december, we announced our biggest ever order for new aircraft, with commitments for 16 boeing 777-300er long-range aircraft and three airbus 330-300s, which will be delivered between 2007 and 2010, together with purchase rights for a further 20 b777-300ers. this reflects the confidence we have in the future of hong kong and the aviation industry.

looking forward, we remain optimistic about our future, although our 2006 results are likely to remain heavily dependent on fuel prices and related surcharges. our efforts will stay focused on delivering superior service and value to our customers, profitably growing our operations, and strengthening hong kong s position as a global aviation hub.
