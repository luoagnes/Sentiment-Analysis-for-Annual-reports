chairman s statement on behalf of the board of directors (the board ), i am pleased to present the annual results of climax international company limited (the company ) and its subsidiaries (the group ) for the financial year ended 31 march 2009.
review and future developments with the hit of the worldwide financial crisis, the company and the group had gone through another hard year. the group continued to reduce its reliance on manufacturing through outsourcing production to subcontractors, streamlining its operation by further downsizing its labour force and realising under-utilised assets. as anticipated that the intensive competition in paper products market will be continued, the group has started a new trading business in electronic market at the end of this fiscal year. the new business has given a great challenge and opportunity to the management. in future, the group will excel in its new business and take advantage of the market adversities and seize upon suitable investment opportunities to provide tremendous value-added to shareholders.

i would like to take this opportunity to deliver my most sincere gratitude to the board members and management team for their devoted commitments during the year.
on behalf of the group, i would also like to dedicate my special thanks to our bankers, investors, vendors and most importantly to our customers for their enduring trusts and supports.
with the commitments of all parties, we are on the mission in creating greater values to our shareholders, customers and employees in the future.
