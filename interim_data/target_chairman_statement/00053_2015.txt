chairman s statement each of our core businesses will continue to focus on implementing their strategies to strengthen their platforms and to enhance their competitiveness to achieve sustainable growth for all i am pleased to present our annual report for the financial year ended 30 june 2015.

the twelve months to june 2015 was an eventful period for financial markets. notable developments included a sharp correction in energy prices, an official end of quantitative easing in the us followed by the start of a similar programme by the ecb, and finally an abrupt reversal to an explosive chinese a-share rally near the end of our financial year. notwithstanding occasional volatility, most equity markets managed to produce another year of positive gains. this favourable background environment benefited the group s investment activities. other core businesses of the group though, confronted with headwinds and challenges in their respective operating markets, had turned in commendable results for the year.

the group s consolidated profit attributable to equity shareholders for the financial year 201415, after taxation and non-controlling interests, amounted to hk$4.6 billion, as compared to hk$5.8billion for the previous year. profit from operations slightly increased year-on-year. this was achieved with substantial contributions from principal investment together with higher operating profit contributions this year from property development and investment as well as hospitality and leisure business.
in addition to the interim dividend of hk$1.00 per share already paid, the directors will be recommending a final dividend of hk$3.00 per share (2014: hk$3.00 per share) at the forthcoming annual general meeting. this gives a total dividend of hk$4.00 per share, same as last year, maintaining our healthy trend of dividend payout to shareholders.

supportive central bank and government policies remained an important driver behind the continuing stock market recovery since the 2008 financial crisis. in spite of an end to qe by the fed, the european central bank and chinese authorities engineered major stimulus programmes during the year while abenomics remained ongoing in japan. these policies and the resulting uptrend in global stocks boosted our investment returns. we capitalised on the strength in share prices and realised profits in some of our we will remain prudent in managing our portfolio and continue to focus on long-term cycle trends and laggard opportunities. shareholders are cautioned that our results are very much subject to fair value movements and thus will continue to be volatile.
property development and investment
for the second consecutive year, guocoland managed to record revenue in excess of s$1 billion from sales of existing projects and new launches. this is a satisfactory outcome when viewed in the context of the slowing economies and regulatory measures introduced to cool down the property markets in which guocoland operates. as a result, net debts only showed a marginal increase despite the start of construction of a few new guocoland s past dependence on development income had created volatility in reported results. with the impending completion of existing rather sizable composite projects, damansara city, kuala lumpur and tanjong pagar, singapore in the first and second half of 2016 respectively and together with singapore s 20 collyer quay (the former tung centre), the resulting recurring income base shall better complement guocoland s beijing dongzhimen project was the single largest integrated project within guocoland s portfolio. the hainan court s favourable judgment last september encouraged us to carry on with the project. a number of parties since then approached us to initiate discussions to take over the project. amongst them, we were able to strike a deal with china cinda post our financial year end. this transaction effectively halves guocoland s gearing ratio to 0.73 times.
a comprehensive review of guocoland s bench strength was carried out to ensure there is competency and efficiency to cater for expanding its business scope.
hospitality and leisure business

hong leong financial group berhad ( hlfg ) the financial year was a challenging one for hlfg which confronted an environment of decelerating economic growth, a competitive industry landscape as well as volatile currency markets. however, it managed to maintain its pretax earnings. its banking division, hong leong bank berhad ( hlb ), registered a modest growth for the year, thanks to a higher write back of allowance for impairment losses on loans, advances and financing, the increase in net interest income and higher share of earnings from bank of chengdu co., ltd and sichuan jincheng consumer finance joint venture. the insurance operations were affected by lower interest rates which resulted in higher actuarial provisions. amid an environment of subdued capital markets activity, the investment banking operations recorded a slight contraction in earnings due to lower contribution from its asset management operations.
