the year 2004 continued to be a challenging year for the hong kong banking industry, as banks grappled with high liquidity in the banking system and soft loan demand. nevertheless, the overall asset quality of retail banks improved in 2004, as the property market gradually recovered and the bad debt overhang cleared in tandem with improving economic conditions. as a result, there is a general feeling of cautious optimism as we enter 2005. banks in hong kong will continue to seek new revenue sources in view of the keen competition. in addition, due to the forthcoming implementation of new basel capital accord requirements, banks will continue to devote more resources to their overall risk management framework and and 
bea continued to grow and expand in 2004. the banks proven growth strategy enabled it to enhance its franchise and strengthen its competitive position in the market, despite the weak loan demand. the bank will continue to explore new market opportunities and develop alternate income sources. a range of innovative products has been developed to serve customers needs. in particular, aggressive expansion of the banks wealth management business through the supremegold brand will be maintained. in addition, the bank will further leverage its leading position in business, corporate and investor services through tricor holdings limited, and similar opportunities in insurance business through blue cross (asia- pacific) insurance limited. furthermore, the bank will continue to seek potential acquisition and alliance opportunities.
the bank will further enhance operating efficiencies. the bank has conducted a number of initiatives to date, including branch rationalisation, shifting of certain back-office operations to mainland china and the much anticipated office centralisation project. this project, which will consolidate hong kong back office operations at millennium city 5 in kwun tong, has been progressing smoothly. the office tower was ready for occupation in the fourth quarter of 2004, and the bank intends to complete relocation of its support operations to the tower within the first half of 2005.
the china market remains a key focus of the banks strategy.
following further expansion of its branch and office network on the mainland in 2004, the bank is well equipped to capture the opportunities arising from the liberalisation of the banking sector and continued growth of renminbi business.
with the banks well-developed market presence and good business prospects in china, the growing contribution to profits from corporate services and insurance businesses, as well as on-going efforts to improve operating efficiencies, bea will continue to build for the future and strengthen its franchise in hong kong, the mainland and international markets.
