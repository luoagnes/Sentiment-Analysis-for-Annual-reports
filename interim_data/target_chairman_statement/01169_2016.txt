during 2015, the overall home appliance market demonstrated slackening growth amid the downturn of the property market, destocking of air-conditioners and soft demand from the international market. meanwhile, with the increasing penetration of online stores for home appliances, traditional sales channels for home appliances were under pressure to adapt. furthermore, the emergence of innovative patterns of consumption and production including c2b customisation and service customisations has redefined the roadmap by which a branded home appliance player adapt to be the winner in the home appliance industry.
i. readjust to keep stable growth in 2015, the group readjusted itself in response to market changes. it achieved a revenue of rmb62.826 billion, representing a decline of 6.4%. net profit attributable to parent company grew by 10.5% from the previous year to rmb2.703 billion, translating to a net profit margin attributable to parent company of 4.3%.
in 2015, especially in the second half of the year, the growth momentum of the white goods sector in which we operated weakened. while it became increasingly difficult to achieve growth in revenue with the traditional business model, the group continued to engage in technological innovation and upgrading of the product mix in its washing machine and water heater segments, achieving balanced development with increased revenue and sustained gross profit, together with enlarged market share in the high-end product sector, further strengthening the leading position of the haier brand in both the domestic and international markets of home appliances.
according to euromonitor, haier accounted for 9.8% of the global large-scale home appliances market in terms of retail volume in 2015, topping the world for the seventh consecutive i. readjust to keep stable growth
actively embracing opportunities presented in the internet era, in 2015 the group invested heavily in businesses with high growth potential and improved the competitiveness of its integrated channel services business. we exited in a timely manner from the distribution business of television and digital product, which contributed to revenue but had diminishing marginal profits. to serve our collaboration partners in a more efficient manner, we restructured our online and offline sales system and focused on full-process superior customer experience to deliver service enhancement for both distributors and users. on the other hand, we shifted more investment to the logistics unit. with the coverage of the logistics business unit extending to home appliances, furniture and cold chain, we continued to develop our warehousing, truck-loading and last mile delivery capability, supporting a rapid solid growth of the logistics business.
whilst 2016 will be a tough period for chinese companies as the macro-economy of china is going through a structural shift, i would say that, if we keep ourselves abreast of the needs of the consumers and the customers, we will be able to grasp the opportunities presented by china s consumption upgrade and expand, on an ongoing basis, our share in the market of mid-to-high-end products and brand services offered to the middle class; if we build a more transparent, highly efficient supply chain service system on the back of our advantages in intergration of online and offline resources, chances are that we may undergo a breakthrough in third- party supply chain management services, which will favour the formation of a new e-commerce platform and bring forth first-mover advantage in the post-e-commerce era.

ii. strategic innovations and roadmap for transformation in 2015, in order to achieve its strategic transformation, the group started from upgrading the interconnected manufacturing, smart appliance, integration of online and offline channels and smart logistics system, and achieved significant periodical result.
1. smart home appliances for white goods with direct linkage between interconnected factories and users the group s white goods business focused on the followings: transforming the ecosystem from home appliances to smart network devices and to internet of things ( iot ), and via the seamless, transparent and customised interconnected manufacturing factories, the group achieved interconnection with users, transforming from mass manufacturing to mass customisation.
it is our strategy to maintain our leading position in the mid-to-high-end product models and to promote the prevalence of smart home appliances. for our haier washing machines, we strove to make high- end technology available in our mid-to-high-end products, with the introduction of leading mid-to-high- end products including twin ella and new crystal, and remained a leader in the market share of mid-to- high-end products. in our smart products, we strove to promote the seamless integration of home appliances and the internet. more models were equipped with wifi function and supported mobile app operation, offering more washing scenarios to users. for water heaters, we also enhanced our product mix, by developing high- end products including pure water electric heaters and king heat pump in 2015.

ii. strategic innovations and roadmap for transformation
1. smart home appliances for white goods with direct linkage between interconnected factories and users (continued) the realisation of unmanned and smart interconnected factories has delivered sound performance. in 2015, we established the most advanced interconnected factories for the production of washing machines and water heaters in foshan and qingdao. apart from having automated, smart and visualized factories, we have enabled zero distance connection between users and factories, with users participation in product design, product manufacturing, as well as product sales and marketing. by the extensive use of advanced technology including 3d simulation and vision identification, we built unmanned factories which were equipped with tens of thousands of sensors and rfid, enabling collection of data on users, production and quality throughout the process, and creating the seamless, transparent and visualized experience of the best quality for users.
the collection of big data and prevalence of smart home appliances have given rise to the gradual realisation of iot ecosystem for white goods. in 2015, a smart washing ecosystem which was uniquely available from haier was formed in its washing machines. by collecting data from the users and research databases, we summarized data on washing from fabrics, stains, water quality to users washing habits, which helped us to analyse and match washing machines, clothes and washing detergents. the best washing procedures can be formulated under the smart matching of clothes of different fabrics and colours. in addition, we are able to recommend the most suitable detergents to users according to water features and users washing habits and teach them how to wash their clothes well .
