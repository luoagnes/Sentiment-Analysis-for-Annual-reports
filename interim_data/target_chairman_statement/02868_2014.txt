on behalf of the board of directors (the board) of beijing capital land ltd. (bcl or the company; together with its subsidiaries, the group), i am pleased to present the groups annual results for the year ended 31 december 2013.
in 2013, the global economy continued to experience a slow recovery from the financial crisis. in the us, the economy continued to pick up and the federal reserve took its first steps to ease back on its third round of quantitative easing (qe3). meanwhile, the economy in the european union rebounded from its bottom and showed signs of recovery from negative growth and emerging markets and other developing countries maintained a relatively rapid rate of growth. while the overall growth rate slowed to some extent, it still remained much higher than most developed countries.
in china, the country remained on track for steady economic development. most economic indicators during the year continued to remain positive, easing worries about a deepening economic downturn. the third plenary session of the 18th central committee of chinas communist party issued development guidance to comprehensively push throughdeepen reforms and presented a series of practical measures that are expected to be rolled out. these measures are largely viewed as a positive signal for the ongoing support of comprehensive development in china. in addition, policies stated in the report of the third plenary of the 18th central committee of chinas communist party addressed many of the in-depth issues related to the property sector, including the need to roll out reforms for rural land transfer, press ahead with urbanization, bring forward legislation for property tax reform, and establish sustainable policies to enable healthy development of 
the property sector maintained a rapid pace of growth in 2013. the transaction volumes and prices rose for both land and residential markets due to strong demand in first and second tier cities while the property market remained segmented by the sluggish growth in medium and smaller-sized cities as a whole. leading companies in the sector mostly followed market trends and policy requirements and flexibly adjusted their operating strategies by focusing on residential property. strong demand for residential property from owneroccupier buyers and rapid turnover helped the leading property developers maintain faster growth in their operating results. all of these factors strongly facilitated the healthy and stable development of the sector, and further enhanced sector concentration. property developers are expected to continue to enhance their overall operational capabilities to capture new opportunities brought about by urbanization, and retain their core competitiveness in the highly competitive and rapidly consolidating market.
2013 was a critical year in the groups strategic development. the group appointed mckinsey to thoroughly review the companys businesses and management, and together, bcl and mckinsey jointly developed a strategic five year plan. the strategy will focus on the development of the groups three main business lines, namely traditional residential property, residential + integrated outlets, and urban core complex. moreover, a comprehensive strategy was established for each individual business line and the company introduced innovative measures to enhance its management and incentive schemes in an effort to maximize both operational flexibility and employee morale, while also supporting overall business growth.
the groups strategy of acquiring new land bank during the year has primarily been focus on core regions.
the group acquired new high quality plots of land in beijing, tianjin, shanghai and chongqing. investments in beijing and tianjin accounted for 77% of total new land bank, further enhancing the groups land reserves in its core region. the group also successfully entered the shanghai market as part of its strategy to expand in the yangtze river delta. in terms of business lines, the group has been making progress in developing its 3 core business lines: residential properties, residence + outlets complex, and urban core complex. the group has also added an innovative supplement to these business lines with its primary land development business. for the residential properties business, all of the new projects that the group acquired during the year, including the shenyang eco village, tianjin eco village, chongqing eco village, and tianjin cambridge county projects, were also launched in the same year. for the residence + outlets complex business, the group actively expanded its cooperation with a greater number of first-class domestic and international brands, reaching nearly 300 by year end. for the urban core complex business, land in the lize financial business district of beijing that was successfully acquired in early 2013 will be developed into a large scale high-end city complex with full access to the subway station underneath. for the primary land development business, the group made progress on its project in the tianjin wuqing land development zone. primary and secondary land development in the area also improved, which helped to keep the project on a healthy track.
during the year, the group actively adjusted to changes in policy and market demand and optimized its product portfolio in a timely manner. the company further increased its investment in and development of projects with strong demand and rapid turnover, including new projects such as beijing ealing, the international peninsula in wuqing, tianjin, and chongqing eco village, all of which recorded satisfactory sales results. moreover, by taking advantage of national policies that are intended to promote urbanization, and other opportunities to meet demand from consumers with higher disposable incomes and increasingly refined tastes, the group remained committed to further promoting its residential + outlets business model.
during the year, the group successfully launched several outlet projects in beijing and huzhou. in particular, the beijing-novotown, beijing-ballet town, and kunshan-capital novotel residential + outlets projects recorded sales of rmb3.4 billion. in 2013, the company was able to set a new record for revenues as a result of the groups strategy of focusing on its core regions and products. as at 31 december 2013, the groups accumulated contracted sales in terms of gross floor area (gfa) totaled approximately 1.92 million square meters (sq.m.), and the contracted sales amounted to rmb19.6 billion, representing an increase of 48% over 2012. the average contracted sales price was approximately rmb10,200 per square meter (sq.m.), a yearon-year increase of 33%. revenue grew by 24% to rmb11,320,840,000. net profit attributable to equity holders reached rmb1,522,006,000, an increase of 37% over the previous year. the board of directors has recommended a final dividend of rmb0.22 per share (before tax) for the year ended 31 december 2013.
financial resources, especially large scale long-term financing played an indispensable role in the development and transformation of the business. in 2013, the group introduced a number of innovative financing agreements in order to improve the balance sheet and secure sustainable and stable sources of capital at low cost. in april, 2013, the group issued us$400 million senior perpetual capital securities, and then in november 2013, the group raised rmb2 billion in domestic funds from china life insurance through a debt investment plan. both transactions helped to improve the groups gearing and further diversify its sources of financing. in addition, the group successfully completed the acquisition of juda international holdings limited (juda) (stock code: 1329), a company listed on the main board of hong kong stock exchange, in december 2013. the company intends to develop juda into an overseas platform to further support the groups 
looking forward to 2014, the group will remain committed to integrating its operations, differentiating the business from the competition, further strengthening its focus on traditional core regions and businesses, and following the new five year strategic plan. in terms of regional layout, the group will primarily focus on core regions such as beijing, tianjin, shanghai, chengdu, chongqing and the surrounding areas of each of these cities. in terms of business model, the groups residential property development business will continue to focus on products with rapid turnover and strong demand from owner-occupier buyers in an effort to maintain sales momentum. the group will further leverage the success of its outlets model and steadily replicate it in other major first and second tier cities. bcl also intends to develop its urban core complex business line into a new growth driver based on the groups development in the lize business district of beijing.
furthermore, the group will continue to maintain and develop its comprehensive financing platform to support further growth by leveraging both domestic and overseas financial markets.
