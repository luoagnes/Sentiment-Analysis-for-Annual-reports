on 3 march 2011, mr. li xiao yun and mr. xu ying, the former chairman and vice-chairman of the board, were removed from office as the vast majority of the members of the board believed that mr. li and mr. xu had not completely disclosed to the board their knowledge of the incident in relation to mr. liu, and i was appointed to serve as the chairperson of the board in the capacity of an independent non-executive director. during the special general meeting convened by the group on 26 april 2011, mr.

the group, through almost nine years of rapid development, has established its project network nationwide and realised economies of scale in city piped gas distribution, lpg distribution and cng vehicle gas businesses in spite of the difficulties and challenges in the past financial year. the above core businesses have generated ongoing net operating cashflow for the group to support our development. in addition, through the concerted efforts of the board of directors and the management, our shareholders, creditors, staff and the local governments of the regions where the group s projects are located have built up strong confidence in our capability of defying the temporary hardship and maintaining sustainable development.
i am optimistic about the core businesses of the group. looking to the next financial year, the group will spare no effort to secure large quality projects in city piped gas distribution business with upstream development as priority. by leveraging on diversified strategies including cooperative operation with upstream enterprises and capital injection, the group is dedicated to establish a stable and long-term relationship of demand and supply between the upstream and downstream through a win- win benefit chain. the move will address the concern about gas source for the group s projects and assure the selected projects of stable gas supply to expand business penetration.
the group aims to reinforce its leading position in the market and position itself as front-runner in the gas industry by way of positive development. with respect to the lpg business, the group will step up mergers and acquisitions in the lpg market. next, the group will intensify the consolidation of downstream end markets. on top of completing the merger and acquisition of panva lpg as soon as practicable, the group will also accelerate the mergers and acquisitions of quality assets in regions where the group s existing project companies are operated, in a bid to swiftly transform those project companies into regional market leaders. besides, the group will strive for the transition from a single operation-distributor to an operation-service provider , and research and introduce value-added services to the end users by tapping into existing service network, management platform and customer base. in the coming five years, it is envisaged that the group will supply natural gas to more than 12,000,000 households, and lpg to more than 30,000,000 households, serving over 150,000,000 customers in total. by fully exploring the value of our customer network, the group will further expand profit generators, broaden profit sources and enhance its profitability.
the group will continue to establish and maintain long-term collaboration with banks at home and abroad to support the future business development plans of the group. moreover, the group will strengthen the managerial role of its headquarters and exercise full-scale supervision and assessment on the operation and financial management of each project company, while also push forward the reform of management and control of the same, with an aim to heightening management efficiency and effectiveness and achieving the harmonious development among employees, enterprises, society and nature. in addition, the group will endeavour to render quality social public services and establish itself as a well-organised gas corporation which wins the trust from customers, gains the respect from the community, and creates values for the shareholders.
lastly, i would like to express my heartfelt gratitude for the contribution and support from our fellow board members, as well as for the enduring devotion and dedication of the entire staff and management team, which enabled the group to sharpen the competitive edge. on behalf of the board of directors, i would also like to thank our shareholders for their unswerving trust and full support for our policy of value creation, and the banking industry and investors for their confidence, encouragement and wong sin yue, cynthia
