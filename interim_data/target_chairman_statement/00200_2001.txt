in the coming years, it is expected that the various infrastructure projects initiated by the government will bring a positive impact on the economy of hong kong. in addition, the government is currently working towards adding more tourist attractions so as to retain the image of hong kong as a first class tourist destination. all these activities and promotions are expected to benefit the groups catering revenue and enhance the growth of tourism and leisure-related business.
it is anticipated that the gradual economic recovery in asia will also allow the group to seek appropriate investment and development opportunities in order to further strengthen its earning potential.
