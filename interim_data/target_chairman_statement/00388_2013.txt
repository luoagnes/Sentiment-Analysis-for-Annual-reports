chairman s statement the world s financial markets had another challenging year in 2012.
however, it was also a year of particular significance for hkex, as we achieved our strategic goal of adding new asset classes by acquiring the lme group.
through the acquisition, we shall build hkex into a leading global, vertically integrated multi-asset class exchange for both our local and international clients.
this is a move that is consistent with our vision to reinforce hong kong s position as an international financial hkex group s performance the exchange sector s post-financial crisis slowdown continued in 2012, as europe s financial problems, subpar economies in japan and the us, and slower growth in the mainland of china dampened market sentiment. although activities in our markets improved in the latter part of the year after central banks of major economies injected more liquidity into their respective financial systems, annual turnover in our markets was down from the previous year. new listings and ipo fundraising also declined. as a result, the group s profit attributable to shareholders in 2012 was about $4.1 billion, a decline of 20 per cent from a year ago. consistent with the company s practice of paying 90 per cent of its profit attributable to shareholders as dividends, the board is recommending a final dividend of $1.46 per share for the year ended 31 december 2012. if the recommendation is approved by shareholders, the full-year dividend per share for 2012 will be $3.31, down 22 per cent from the previous year.
acquisition of lme group our acquisition of the lme group was a significant milestone for the company. it has given us new capabilities and positioned us to broaden our ties with the mainland of china. the offer decision was made after considering a series of factors, amongst them, the establishment of hkex s presence in commodities market, which is a sector that offers growing opportunities. we will work closely with our lme colleagues to expand lme s current business, move into new areas, and develop its untapped potential. to partly fund the acquisition, we issued convertible bonds of us$500 million and had a share placement of over $7.7 billion. the overwhelming responses to both issues were a clear testimony of investors unwavering confidence in hkex.
the acquisition of the lme group was completed in the final month of the period covered by our previous strategic plan of 2010-2012. details of other achievements under the plan are set out in the chief executive s review, business review, and financial review sections of this annual report.
the new 3-year plan for 2013-2015 is set out in the hkex group strategic plan 2013-2015 section of this annual report.
other major developments investing and building for the future we also invested and built for the future in other key areas in 2012. apart from the introduction of 4 hkd- denominated benchmark equity index futures of the other member exchanges of the brics alliance, which enable investors to get exposure to the brics markets through hkex, hsi andor h-shares index futures were cross-listed on each of the brics exchanges.
our tko data centre and the hosting services began operations in the fourth quarter of 2012, which are part of the hkex orion, a $3 billion-investment programme designed to strengthen our markets and hong kong s position as a leading international financial centre. the gfis, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, also officially commenced operations in shanghai.
we expect to open a market data hub in shanghai in the third quarter of 2013 that will give mainland information vendors direct access to our real-time market data. the cesc, a joint venture we established with the stock exchanges in shanghai and shenzhen in 2012, launched its first index, an index to track the performance of shares in the mainland of china and hong kong, on 10 december. regarding otc clear, we formed a strong team and completed much of the preparatory work with a view towards opening for business in the first half of 2013.

the quantitative easing policies implemented in the key financial markets including europe, japan and the us, would help improve market sentiment. nonetheless, the low interest rates and expansion of money supply could cause higher inflation than desired. the effectiveness of these easing policies on improving the performance of the global economies is yet to be proven. hong kong would however continue to benefit from the progress of the mainland china s economy in 2013.
our markets experienced increased turnover at the end of last year and the beginning of this year, and we saw renewed investor interest in ipos. while the global economic outlook remains challenging, we believe we are well positioned to weather any storms that might come our way.
