chairman s statement in 2015, complicated by the european sovereign debt crisis and the move by the united states federal reserve to raise interest rate, the global economy slowed down to a growth rate that was below the general expectations.
in china, the economy still grew steadily and at a reasonable rate although it was facing challenges from home and abroad. after thirty years of consistent, rapid growth, china s economic and social development has entered a new stage where growth has become moderate and the service sector has gradually become predominant in the country s economy. a noteworthy development is that mobile internet has brought revolutionary changes to a number of traditional industries. the chinese government has been pursuing macroeconomic control measures relentlessly and has taken initiatives to improve the operating environment that has encouraged more people to start their own businesses. as a result, both employment and personal income have been growing steadily and the people s consumption power has been built up. traditional industries have also been pursuing reforms to improve the operating environment to meet consumers higher requirements. an increasing number of consumers are trading up, which will serve as an important growth driver of the economy after the chinese government slashed import tariffs on daily consumer goods by more than 50%. moreover, the chinese government cut import tariffs twice during the year in an attempt to divert the chinese nationals spending from the overseas to domestic markets.
consumption has developed into a primary driving force of china s economy and contributed to almost 60% of its growth. in light of the changes in the consumer market, the chinese government has decided to leverage on both the international and domestic markets and has adopted policies on expediting the reforms of industries and on encouraging consumers to trade up (including the reduction of tariffs). the measures are aimed at sustaining the healthy development of the economy.
