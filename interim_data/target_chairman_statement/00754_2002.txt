despite the economic slowdown that affected every industry on a global basis, china was able to sustain encouraging economic growth, the momentum of which continues with the nation s accession into the world trade organization ( wto ). in 2001, china achieved a 7.3% increase in gdp growth, one of the highest in among the major cities in china, guangzhou demonstrated its outstanding potential for further development. in 2001, guangzhou achieved a gdp growth of 13% and its citizens average disposable income also increased at a rate of 7% which was ranked the first among major cities. this affluence has led to a rising trend for property ownership. in 2001, the expenditures related to housing were also elevated to approximately 13.9% of the total consumers facing an active market with keen competition, product design, immaculate service quality as well as market reputation have become increasingly important areas of contention. amidst a challenging market environment, the group still enjoys considerable competitive edges through the established brand it has earned as a property developer adhering to the high quality products and services.

with china s full entrance into wto and the impetus brought by the hosting of the 2008 olympic games in beijing, the outlook for china s property market is more attractive than ever, particularly in major cities. the trend of property ownership has entrenched into an impregnable position in today s living in china.
the group will capitalise on its competitive edges and further expand its business into other major cities in china. in january 2002, the group moved its first step out of guangzhou and announced its participation in four sizable projects in beijing and tianjin with a total investment cost amounting to approximately hk$820 million, which is intended to be financed by internal resources, on-going proceeds and bank borrowings. full details of these projects were set out in a circular dated 31st january, 2002 to the shareholders of the company.
