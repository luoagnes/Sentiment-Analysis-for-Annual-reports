the prices and quantities of transactions have both gone up in some first-tier and second-tier cities, as well as economically developed regions and provinces. the trend of real estate market of the year is in line with our judgment. being close to the market and keeping pace of sales of the projects, the group carried out more progressive sales strategies, strived to market properties and increase efficiency of capital return, and facilitated steady growth of sales. for the year ended 31 december 2015, the group, benefited from the advantage resulted from the high quality land reserve and differentiated competition strategy, achieved a contracted sales amount of rmb19.51 billion, exceeding the contracted sales target for the entire year, representing an increase of 28.1% over last year.
the group adhered to its strategy of deepening its foothold in the key cities in the pearl river delta such as guangzhou, foshan and the group actively expanded its land reserve through various means, including participation in government s land auctions, city redevelopment projects, greenfield development projects, cooperation with other parties and acquisition of target companies, which laid a solid foundation for obtaining sufficient supply of land.

during the last year, the group adhered to our prudent strategy of investing in the economically developed cities in the pearl river delta region such as guangzhou and foshan. during the year, the group acquired a total of thirteen land parcels with total planned gross floor area (the gfa ) of 1.957 million square meters.
meanwhile, the group continued its prudent financial strategy while ensuring sufficient land reserve and units available for sale. it also expanded its financing channels by leveraging on onshore and overseas platforms, which helped improve our debt structure. in 2015, the group raised approximately rmb6.7 billion by issuance of domestic corporate bonds and senior notes. such expansion of financing channels helped guarantee the provision of sufficient funds for the group and therefore was favorable to our continuous growth of business size and profitability and is also capable of supporting the group to capture opportunities arising from the forthcoming phase of relatively fast growth in the residential property market of china.
