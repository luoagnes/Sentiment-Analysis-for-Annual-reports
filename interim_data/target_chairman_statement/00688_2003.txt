chairman s statement review of operations due to the sustained slowing down of the us economy and political instability in some parts of the globe, the world economy in 2002 was adversely affected. over the past few years, the hong kong sar government has implemented a series of economic measures. however, due to the adverse external factors, transformation of the hong kong economy, sustained high unemployment rate, deflation and fiscal deficits, there is no clear sign of recovery for the hong kong economy. on the other hand, the prc economy is one of the very few countries which continue to perform well in 2002.
with its accession to the wto, the prc economy has become more international and market driven. the board believes that the prc economy will maintain its rapid growth in the coming years.
the group has been increasing its investment in the prc since 1997 and has been gradually moving its assets and businesses northward, achieving satisfactory results. the profit before tax contribution of the prc property development business has been increasing rapidly and had a growth rate of 70% to hk$342 million in 2002.
as the hong kong sar government is cutting its spending on infrastructure while the private sector investment is also shrinking, the hong kong construction market continues to contract in size and competition is intensified. amid the unfavorable business environment in last year, the group managed to secure new projects with a total contract value of hk$9.3 billion (including project management) and earned an encouraging profit before tax of hk$130 million.

while the future development of the world economy is cautiously optimistic and it takes time to improve the structural problems in the various aspects of the hong kong economy, the prc economy continues to stand out. with its accession to the wto, the prc economy continues to maintain its rapid growth trend and this will benefit the operation of the group and provide us with the best opportunities. the group takes the sustained enhancement of shareholders value as its core corporate objective. by way of integrating internal and external resources, and strengthening of its management capability, we aim at improving the consolidated strength and competitiveness of various business segments, so as to ultimately achieving over 10% return on the shareholders fund.
it is expected that the group s businesses in the next few years shall still be carried out in the prc and hong kong. property development in the prc, construction in hong kong and industrial investment in the prc will be our 3 core businesses.
the detailed strategies and measures include: i. the group has been increasing its investment in the prc since 1997 and has been gradually moving its assets and businesses northward, achieving satisfactory results. the profit before tax contribution of the prc property development business has been increasing rapidly and had a growth rate of 70% to hk$342 million in 2002. the group is of the view that the prc property development industry is in a period of great renovation, integration and reorganisation.
to be able to develop and grow under a regulated environment and to rise amid adjustments should be the keys to success. the group will continue to concentrate its capital and management capability on strengthening the development of its property business in the prc and expansion of the profit base of the group. the group will capitalise on its competitive advantages in its mode of management, marketing capability and brand image: (1) the group is determined to increase the amount and to optimise the structure of its land reserve. it is anticipated that the newly added land reserve for the coming three years will be no less than 10 million square feet every year. in the first quarter of 2003, the group entered into agreements to develop 4 pieces of land located in guangzhou, changchun and nanjing city; (2) the group will continue to improve its design, operation and marketing capability and make good use of its brand name to strive for beating the targeted profit margin, rapid increase in sales volume and annual sales area exceeding 10 million square feet after 2005; and prospects (cont d) (3) the group will endeavour to watch the cash flow of all projects closely to ensure that the return on funds employed is satisfactory at all time. we will take measures to ensure that the projects under development and stocks from completed projects are sold well and to maintain our good record of keeping minimal stocks at all times.
the directors would like to remind the shareholders of the company that china overseas property group co., ltd.
( cop ), in which the group holds 79% equity interest, has entered into the guidance period for a share listing in the prc in august last year. the final timetable and other commercial considerations for cop s listing has yet to be determined, but further announcement will be made to comply with the listing rules as and when the application for the separate listing of cop s shares is made. the future development of cop is critical for establishing the leading position of the group in the development business of residential projects in the prc.
ii. it is anticipated that the scale of hong kong construction market will reduce gradually and competition will intensify.
the group will continue to reinforce its leading position in the construction and contracting market in hong kong.
through implementation of active and prudent bidding strategies, effective measures on risk and cost control and exploration of new income sources, these will lead to a better profit margin and cash flow. the group will also continue to expand the construction and contracting market and to improve our market share in the prc and hence its proportion in the group s overall contracting businesses. in the first quarter of 2003, a consortium in which a fellow subsidiary of the group has 45% interest, was awarded the central reclamation phase iii project with a contract value of hk$3.8 billion (a project management contract) and we also won the contract for the hong kong movie city. the total value of these contracts amounted to hk$3 billion. the group will continue to bid for large scale projects such as the hong kong sar government headquarters and the deep bay link.
iii. the group has decided to consolidate the businesses of infrastructure investment, industrial investment and logistics as one of its three backbone businesses. in order to increase medium and long term stable profit and to generate other profit sources, the group will actively seek for new infrastructure projects and construction extended projects in the prc. in february 2003, the group invested hk$23.6 million in united structures holdings limited, representing its 33.33% interest. the principal business of this company is the design, production and sale of relevant products of steel frame. in march 2003, the group invested approximately hk$20 million to increase its equity interest in mtl to 41.8%. also in march 2003, the group entered into a cooperative agreement to invest hk$310 million for 55.4% of equity interest in the nanchang bridge project.
iv. the group expects that it will take a longer period of time for the property market of hong kong to recover. in the short term, the group will continue to strive for selling the stocks on hand with a book cost of about hk$0.8 billion within two years and to expedite the development and sales of the stanley project.
prospects (cont d) v. through active participation in the international capital markets and the capital market in the prc, the group will endeavour to improve its capital and gearing structure and to boost its efforts in rmb financing so as to invest with rmb fund for its prc businesses. at present, the group is financially sound. as at the end of 2002, the group had cash of hk$1.9 billion and unutilised banking facilities of hk$2.6 billion and the net gearing ratio was decreased to 8%. due to sustained rapid expansion of our prc businesses, the gearing ratio will inevitably on the increase in the forthcoming one or two years. nevertheless, the group will adhere to its relatively prudent financial strategy to ensure a sustainable and healthy high growth of the group.
on behalf of the board, i would like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude for the support of the shareholders and our business partners and the contribution of our staff.
