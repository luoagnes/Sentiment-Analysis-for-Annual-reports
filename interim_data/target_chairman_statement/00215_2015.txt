as at 31 december 2014, the group was serving approximately 3.2 million mobile customers in hong kong and macau (31 december 2013: 3.8 million). the decrease in both postpaid and prepaid customer number was mainly due to higher churns of lower-arpu customers as mentioned above under a planned strategy to focus more on serving higher-arpu data centric customers with the advanced 4g lte infrastructure as well as the comprehensive wi-fi hotspots coverage.
to manage the increasing data demand from customers, the deployment of 4g lte advanced services and the construction of time division duplexing network are in the infrastructure enhancement pipeline in 2015. with the well-developed infrastructure, the group anticipates a considerable growth in 4g lte customer number and improvement in overall arpu.
