to all our shareholders we are pleased to announce that our revenue grew by 68.6% and profit attributable to shareholders of nagacorp ltd. (the company ) increased by 53.9% to us$50.2 million for the financial year ended 31 december 2007. earnings per share was approximately us cents 2.42 (hk cents 18.87 per share) compared to us cents 2.12 (hk cents 16.53 per share) in 2006.
the stable political environment and buoyant economic development of cambodia continued for the financial year under review. our business has benefited from these favorable conditions. a very significant development in 2007 is the lesser dependence on the specialized tour group ( stg ) programs which are more prone to recessionary pressures. we have seen a robust growth in gaming activities conducted in our public floor where we admit all customers including cambodians with foreign passports. the public floor became our largest revenue contributor and accounted for 52.3% of the total revenue in 2007. being the landmark entertainment complex in phnom penh, nagaworld has attracted patronage of cambodians who hold foreign passports. the continued economic expansion of cambodia and a growing affluent population support the country s gaming industry.
in 2007, our gaming operations continued to be the principal revenue source and represented over 99% of the total revenue of the group. revenue derived from our gaming operations was approximately us$143.9 million in 2007 compared to us$85.1 million in 2006. the increase in revenue from our gaming operations was attributable mainly to the higher contributions of revenue from our public floor tables and stg floor tables in 2007.

in view of the good results, the board of directors (the board ) has proposed to pay a final dividend of us cents 0.77 per share (hk cents 6.0 per share). the proposed final and interim dividends together represented a combined dividend payout ratio of approximately 60%. this is consistent with our dividend policy to distribute not less than 50% of the group s distributable profit for each year.

our corporate vision is to become a world class corporation with excellence in our products, people and profits for the benefits of the host nation and all our shareholders.
we have continued to make headway in achieving our corporate vision. for the financial year ended 31 december 2007, the company reported significant revenue growth on the back of favourable business conditions. the performance was based mainly on the utilisation of about 101 tables and 211 gaming machine stations, representing only part of our full gaming capacity of 300 tables and over 600 gaming machine stations to be offered in the gaming space of approximately 15,217 sq. m. in nagaworld.
2007 also sees a stable gaming revenue source of at least us$25m per year for the next 10 years. on 13 december 2007 the group has entered into a management agreement with poibos co., ltd., whose shares are listed and traded on kosdaq. the group has agreed to provide gaming management services to poibos in the prescribed gaming hall, a designated area in nagaworld, for a period of 10 years. in return, the group will receive from poibos fixed overriding gaming management fees over two periods namely, the first period of 5 years for us$2.1 million per month (equivalent to us$25.2 million per year) and the second period of 5 years for us$2.6 million per month (equivalent to us$31.2 million per year). the overriding gaming management fees are payable to the group by poibos irrespective of the business performance of the prescribed gaming hall provided to poibos. it is intended that the prescribed gaming hall will be ready for poibos around march or april 2008.
going forward, if the management agreement with poibos is carried out satisfactorily, the group may diversify beyond its traditional gaming markets of malaysia, singapore and southern china into new areas such as korea, japan, taiwan and north eastern china.

revisions made to the internal design and layout and the decision to expand capacity for gaming, entertainment and hotel service and facilities called for revision of the construction schedule of nagaworld which ultimately will have about 700 rooms and about 300 tables by the end of 2009. we have instructed the contractor, architect, engineers and other professional parties with the intention to expedite and fully complete the whole process. upon completion, nagaworld will offer a combined gross built up area of approximately 110,768 sq. m. property price in phnom penh has surged notably over the past few years. it is intended, under the expansion plan, that the motor court located between the hotel wing and casino wing of nagaworld will be converted into a grand hotel lobby. subject to the approval of city hall, restoration works of hotel levels 14, 15 & roof of north & south wings as per original building plans will result in 2 additional floors to each of the north and south tower of the hotel wing respectively and part of the carpark block will be developed to house about 100 rooms (mainly for our staff), a discotheque and a rooftop swimming pool. in view of the coming general elections in mid 2008, the beautification of hun sen garden located in front of nagaworld will be postponed.
we aim to turn nagaworld and nearby proximity to a high energy zone attracting international travellers, tourists and players and cambodians who hold foreign passports who are interested to explore gaming and entertainment experiences.
for search of excellence we have added a few key management positions. we have recruited a senior vice president of operations who has 20 years of our gaming operations experience in burswood perth, australia. we have strengthened the marketing department, now under the leadership of a chief marketing officer leading a full strategic and operation team. at present, the company has a total staff force of about 1,900 barring unforeseen circumstances, despite a lesser optimistic world financial outlook, we are optimistic of a favorable year ahead by virtue of the company s monopolistic position, the surrounding strategic markets, changing customers profile, favorable tax advantage, sound management and a more stable political environment in cambodia.
