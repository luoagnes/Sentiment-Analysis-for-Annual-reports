chairman s statement shareholders rewarded for another solid year eurozone debt woes and a fragile recovery in the united states created market volatilities that slowed down macro-economic growth in global markets.
on the other hand, the global overflow of liquidity chasing both protection and yield put immense pressure on asset values, particularly in the more robust economies in asia. china, hong kong and singapore face the brunt of this new paradigm.
hong kong s economy grew by a modest 1.4% in 2012, down from 5% in 2011. on the other hand, housing prices rose to a new high, caused by an imbalance in supply and demand. in an effort to stabilise the market, the government introduced several rounds of demand management measures as well as longer term measures to increase both private and public housing supply. these measures are expected to facilitate the development of a more stable and sustainable market.
in singapore, the economy grew by 1.3% in 2012, down from 4.9% in 2011. similarly, the government introduced several rounds of fiscal measures to cool the property market. nevertheless, growing affluence and low unemployment rate continued to create a fundamental demand for quality properties.
in china, gdp growth rate also decelerated to 7.8% in 2012. the housing market stabilised in both price and volume. cooling measures introduced at the beginning of the year led to a drop in transactions volume. in the course of the year, market sentiments picked up noticeably as a result of pent-up demand and monetary easing. the government s commitment to double the country s gdp by 2020 and to increase the service sectors share of gdp from 42% to 47% within the five-year plan will further accelerate urbanisation, wealth creation and fuel a growing demand for quality urban living.

corporate governance and social
the group strives to maintain a very high standard of corporate governance by following established sound policies and risk management practices.
we spare no effort to foster the sustainability of the society and the environment. in 2012, the group together with its subsidiaries supported close to 400 programmes of different forms.
back in 1994, the woo wheelock green fund ( wwgf ) was created in collaboration with the environment and conservation fund to support environmental research and technology projects. in the past five years, wwgf supported 13 projects.
recently, a project commenced in 2009 that was aimed at developing an automatic switch-off system for idling automobile engines to achieve fuel saving and reduce emission was completed and is now being prepared for commercialisation. this green motivation, if widely adopted, will have positive impact on air quality and supplements the government s initiative to reduce road side emission.
in 2012, the austin station residential development achieved the beam plus gold certification backed by the active support of our staff volunteers, the group serves the community by supporting non-governmental organisations as well as initiating our own community programmes. among these programmes, we are particularly pleased to see project wecan, our flagship youth development programme, now making an impact to the lives of over 10,000 students of humble backgrounds in financial conditions have improved since the latter part of 2012. however, the global economic outlook remains challenging but is hopefully starting to stabilise. the hong kong and singapore governments have both forecasted their gdp growth rates in a range of 1.5% 3.5% in 2013, reflecting the continuing cautious outlook.
an array of cooling measures imposed on the hong kong and singapore property markets will curb speculation and develop a more sustainable market that will benefit wpl and wpsl respectively.
the mainland s 7.8% gdp growth in 2012 still outpaced other major economies in the world. with sound economic fundamentals and increased efforts to shore up domestic demand, china is expected to maintain its growth momentum in 2013. the next phase of growth should continue to be underpinned by accelerating urbanisation, completion of the high-speed rail network and increasing domestic consumption. the continued wealth creation will generate growing demand for quality urban living and shopping environment, from which the group s china businesses will benefit.
over the years, the company has been fully supportive of wharf and its expansion plans. that includes investing a total of hk$9.6 billion to participate pro rata in wharf s two rights issues in 2008 and 2011 as well as underwriting the remaining hk$9.5 billion. we are delighted that our participation has helped wharf create significant shareholder value through a strengthening of its equity base, delivering record profits, and rewarding its shareholders with a robust increase in dividend distribution and a robust share price.
that, in turn, has allowed the group to expand its hong kong development business through wpl and, at the same time, reward the company s shareholders with much higher dividends and share in february 2012, mr stewart c k leung accepted our invitation to become vice chairman of the company and chairman of wpl. mr leung has extensive experience in property development, management and related businesses in hong kong.
he serves as chairman of the executive committee of the real estate developers association of hong kong. together with mr douglas c k woo and mr ricky k y wong as managing directors of wheelock properties (hong kong) limited, mr leung is a great addition to the wheelock properties team that drives our core business.
mr alexander s k au, after having served as an independent non-executive director for ten years, resigned from the company s board in 22 october 2012 to join the board of directors of wharf.
furthermore, mr herald l f lau, an independent non-executive director of the company since 2010, has decided to retire at the forthcoming annual general meeting and not stand for re-election. i take this opportunity to thank both mr au and mr lau for their invaluable support and guidance during their on behalf of shareholders and my fellow directors, i wish to express our heartfelt gratitude to my senior colleagues and all staff for their dedication and contribution throughout the year.
