2014 was also a challenging year for the chemical fiber industry. amid global economy s slow recovery, decelerating prc economic growth and chemical fiber industry downturn, the group has always adhered to the vision of aspiring to be the world s premier supplier of consumer products, providing eco-friendly products for the public and continued to enhance the development of differentiated chemical fiber and functional environmentally-friendly polyester thin film products. following the proposal of an unconditional mandatory cash offer to acquire the shares of the company on 13 january 2014 by hong kong (rong an) investment limited ( hong kong rong an ), a substantial shareholder of the company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of cecep chongqing, which is in turn a subsidiary of cecep, the largest state-owned enterprise in the prc specializing in energy-saving and environmental protection projects, the relationship between the group and our strategic partner, cecep has become closer in terms of co-operation opportunities and synergy effects. by integrating our clear position and under our management s far-reaching vision and close cooperation, the group has maintained a stable development despite a downturn in the chemical fiber industry.

looking back into the past year, the profitability of the chemical fiber industry stayed at a historically low level. during the year, market prices of our major raw materials, namely, purified terephthalic acid ( pta ) and mono ethylene glycol ( meg ), went down significantly as a result of the significant decrease in crude oil price, and this had directly affected our product price trend.
the prices of chemical fiber products gradually became stable since the rebound of crude oil price started in late january 2015. furthermore, as the challenges faced by china s export industry remained and the global economy has been recovering in a slow pace, china s textile products export remained weak in 2014, while domestic sales of apparel, footwear and home textile products remained stable overall. however, as consumer confidence and income growth rate in general remained low and had limited room for growth, coupled with the frequent fluctuations in the market prices of bulky commodities, the price and profitability of our products declined to different extents despite there having been a strong market demand for our products, and the fact that the group s sales volume and sales amount still maintained a steady growth during the group is the largest polyester filament yarns enterprise in southern china. the group s significant investments in production facilities and other aspects have been among the top in the industry. apart from pursuing the economies of scale, the group will further enhance its production efficiency and product quality, increase the investment on brand building and continue to increase the added values of our products and brands in order to develop and establish enterprise soft power. the group will continue to enhance new market expansion to realize business growth, and integrate with national planning and policies for the chemical fiber industry and polyester thin film industry. meanwhile, the group will monitor upstream resources, track and reserve technologies for upstream raw materials, such as renewable materials, bio-based materials, etc, as well as raising the proportion of recyclable products. in 2014, the group s self- developed project of melt-direct spinning oil- free wasted filament line-adding and its high quality functional manufacturing technology trspbs|v was regarded as the 2014 regional major projects of science and technology in fujian provinceywnnvt @sw'yybv . the project is of significance to the large-scale utilisation of polyester oil-free wasted filament, enhancement of renewable fiber quality and establishment of fiber to fiber recycle development model in the chemical fiber industry. in order to ensure its long-term growth, the group will further intensify its research and development, continue to explore new application sectors, and strengthen the utilisation of modern technologies, thereby realising our product the group will continue to invest more in research and development to enhance our research and development capability, and continue to adopt more advanced equipments to produce differentiated chemical fiber products and polyester thin film products which can attract a strong demand, have special performance and functions and are environmental-friendly.
the group will also reduce waste products and enhance product quality. the group has been paying high attention to marketing channel expansion and customer services. to fully meet our customers differentiated demands, we constantly adjust our product structure, optimize our product mix and provide individualized product development services. we constantly improve our service standards and closely track market technology innovation and product trends in the market. we expect that the synergy effect of our cooperation with cecep in new products as well as in the research and development area will progressively increase. on this basis, the group will launch more quality products conducive to both consumers health and ecology in the future, while strengthening the efforts in promoting the application of the five key elements, namely, ecology, fashion, function, environmental protection, as well as science and technology to in 2014, the group s export sales grew by 30.2% and was selected as the china export leading indicator -n w y q s hq c xe (eli) published by the general administration of customs of the people s republic of china ( prc ), demonstrating that the group s brands have won further recognition in overseas markets.
