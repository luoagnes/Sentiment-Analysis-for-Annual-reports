chairman s statement it is with great delight that i present the group s 2014 annual report and its audited financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2014.
in 2014, whilst global economy showed a sluggish growth with varying performance across regions, international trade growth remained soft. overall speaking, the over-supply in shipping capacity in the international maritime market means a continued slowdown in global port industry was seen.
amid the complex operating environment and ever-changing market, the group s endeavours in promoting the integration and optimization of resources, transforming and upgrading of operational management, and stepping up market expansion have all played a part in the group s achievement of a higher-than-industry-average growth in operating results and business performance of its core ports operation, with breakthroughs achieved in terms of overseas expansion, development of homebase port and promotion of innovation, all contributing to the enhancement in the group s business scale, service quality and asset efficiency.
encouraging progresses were made by various overseas operations, including, most notably, the commissioning of the facilities at colombo international container terminals limited ( cict ), sri lanka, has seen the group s container terminal business reaching a higher level, which, cohering with the one belt, one road development strategy of china, will be able to offer a stronger support in the group s ongoing overseas business expansion. the development of homebase ports has also made a great leap forward, with port areas in shekou, chiwan and mawan of west shenzhen all being included in the china (guangdong) pilot free trade zone ( guangdong free trade zone ), putting the group in a favorable position in further solidifying the status of its homebase port in west shenzhen as a key hub, capturing potential opportunities in a free port development, as well as driving the transformation and upgrading of ports operations. innovation-driven initiatives remain high in the group s agenda, with significant progresses seen in innovation in terms of business model, technological and technical processes, and operational management, which, with pilot projects ranging from the initiation of cross-border e-commerce to online trading platform for grains, having carefully considered the integration of operational processes with internet technologies and the synthesis of asset and capital base, will lend support to the group s expansion into potential markets and the nurturing of new growth drivers.

review for the year in 2014, the group s ports handled a total container throughput volume of 80.84 million teus, a jump of 13.4% as compared to that of 2013, attributed partly to the contributions from the new overseas projects in terminal link sas ( terminal link ) and cict, and partly to the consistent growth delivered by the group s ports in china, thus reinforcing the group s market position among global port operators. container throughput handled by the group s ports in mainland china rose by 5.0%, a growth rate higher than that of foreign trade-derived container throughput handled by china s ports, to 59.56 million teus, while ports in hong kong, taiwan and overseas handled a combined container throughput of 21.28 million teus, an increment of 6.69 million teus when compared to that in 2013. bulk cargo handled by the group s terminals during 2014 totaled 363 million tonnes, registering a steady growth of 4.1% against gravitating upon the three strategic objectives of homebase port establishment, overseas expansion, and innovative development , the group has been steadily pursuing designated tasks during 2014, thus ensuring the sustainable growth of the group s core ports operation and its business concerning the establishment of homebase port, the inclusion of the port areas in shekou, chiwan and mawan of west shenzhen as part of the guangdong free trade zone during the year has created favourable conditions in enhancing the status of the group s homebase port as a key hub, capturing potential opportunities in a free port establishment, and driving the transformation and upgrading of ports operation.
together with the set-up of the guangdong free trade zone were initiatives rolled out on various fronts, including the group s on-going effort in widening the tonggu channel which enables the strengthening of the hub status of west shenzhen port zone, continuous deepening of consolidation and integration of operations between chiwan and shekou, with the container handling business of china merchants port services (shenzhen) co., ltd ( cmps ) forming part of it, the completion of switching and upgrading of self-developed port operating system, cm port, within the west shenzhen port zone and the initiation of a barge service platform, one port , both of which boosting the operating efficiency of the homebase port, and the opening of a refined road network in the proximity by the end of last year which facilitates further collaborations between ports and the bonded logistics port zone, as reflected in an improvement in the business activity of the barge feeder shuttle services within pearl river delta, the inland ports and the sea-rail inter-modal operations.
with respect to overseas strategy, cict, the group s first greenfield project, in sri lanka achieved remarkable results in its second year of operation, delivering container throughput of 0.69 million teus during the year, while lom container terminal s.a. ( lct ) in togo, the first 700 metres of shoreline of which commenced its trial operation towards the end of 2014, is expected to be fully operational during the first half of 2015. with the total container throughput contributed by the group s overseas operations reaching 17.4% of the group s during 2014, up by 6.9 percentage points year-on-year, overseas operation has become one of the group s key growth drivers, and will offer even more potential considering the group s long-established philosophies and business expansion which aligns with the one belt, one road development strategy currently advocated by china.
innovation strategy has long been the foundation for the group s sustainable development. the group s devoted engagements in promoting innovation were widely recognized during the year under review, with its remote control rubber tyred gantry ( rtg ) crane project having been awarded the first prize of technological innovation among the transport corporations in china ( k8omiybure 0ni{ns), and its refined management information system that went live in july 2014 having been awarded with the first prize of achievement in modernized and innovative management among the transport corporations in china ( ebg 0ni{ns). building onto the momentum, innovative projects including, amongst others, the exploration of cross- border e-commerce model and the establishment of online trading platform for bulk cargoes, have shown noticeable the divestment from the cold chain operation in 2015 out of a strategic consideration is a proof of the group s continual devotion to allocating resources to its core ports and port- related operations, including the bonded logistics operation which delivered a remarkable improvement in the operating results, as seen in its high level of warehouse utilisation rate maintained throughout the year, the sturdy increase in container volume derived from the collaboration of ports and the bonded logistics port zone, and the rapid growth demonstrated in the new business. the free trade zone policies pursued going forward can only mean a greater development potential of the group s bonded logistics on the financial aspect, the issue of the mandatory convertible securities ( mcs ) to raise no less than hk$15.3 billion, fully underwritten by china merchants union (bvi) limited ( cmu ) (which is 50% beneficially owned by the company s ultimate holding company, china merchants group limited), was successfully completed in june 2014, thereby improving the group s capital structure, in turn lifting the group s credit profile and enhancing its borrowing the international monetary fund ( imf ), in its world economic outlook report published in january 2015, forecasted that global economic growth will remain stagnant in the next two years, with the us the only major economy having its growth forecast revised up, while the abating investment appetite resulting from an anticipated slowdown in medium-term growth of a number of developed and emerging economies is expected to offset the stimulus brought about by a weaker oil price. the report published by imf suggested that global economy will grow by 3.5% in 2015, up 0.2 percentage point from that in 2014, with china s economic growth forecast revised down to 6.8%, while world trade volume (including goods and services) is projected to grow by 3.8% in 2015, an increase of 0.7 percentage point from 2014.
in tandem with the backdrop of a feeble global economic recovery and deceleration of growth in emerging economies, the global port industry is again anticipating a picture of slow growth in 2015 with varying performance across regions, amid a steady growth expected in china s economy alongside its initiatives of economic structural upgrade and a new normal growth target, a growth momentum demonstrated in the us economy, and a slowing growth and low inflationary environment that tests the economy of the euro-zone and japan. on top of all these, the persistence of an over-capacity situation of shipping lines, the deployment of mega-vessels, the prevalence of shipping alliances and the regional competition of ports all pose challenges to the port industry. thanks to the stability displayed at the ports in china and an acceleration of growth at existing overseas projects, which are the two major growth engines of the group, compounding with the additional contributions from potential acquisitions, and along with an added source of revenue from innovative business models, the group s ports operation is expected to remain solid in 2015.
in order to adapt to an ever-changing external environment, bearing in mind the fundamental need for continuous development, the group is reiterating its vision of becoming a world-class comprehensive port services provider , with the positioning of a comprehensive ports services provider underscoring the group s emphasis on the provision of comprehensive services from the customer s perspective, incorporating the roles of an investor, a developer and an operator of ports, whereas the part of world-class , on the other hand, marking the group s ambition in reaching a global leading position in terms of industry position, business scale, operating efficiency and service quality. going forward, guided by its new strategic orientations, the group will continuously review and refine its development strategies and implementation plans, adhering to the directives of capturing opportunities, achieving breakthroughs and promoting developments , which aim at achieving world-class level in its service quality, business scale, asset efficiency and operational management, by executing the domestic, overseas and innovation strategies with determination, and leveraging upon the opportunities presented by the free trade zones and one belt, one road policies.
concerning domestic strategies, the group will seek to capitalize on the opportunities arising from the establishment of the guangdong free trade zone, by re-defining the role of and re-shaping the operations in the homebase port in west shenzhen, turning it into a gateway and a key hub along the 21st century maritime silk road , as well as a strategic fulcrum from which the development of the qianhai- shekou region in the guangdong free trade zone could base upon. meanwhile, scrutinizing opportunities available for consolidation of and cooperation among domestic ports remains an initiative in further optimizing the group s port network layout within china.
with regards to overseas strategies, the group will, capitalizing on the experiences gained from the construction of an overseas homebase port in cict, dedicate its effort in exploring comprehensive development plan for overseas projects, and in capturing potential opportunities for mergers and acquisitions, keeping close tabs on emerging markets, in order to seek for breakthroughs in its overseas development.
in the aspects of innovations and upgrade on operations, the group will engage itself in facilitating the organic assimilation between ports and bonded logistic operations with the help of internet technologies and e-commerce elements, in studying the feasibility of integration between asset and capital base, and in fostering the establishment of an environment and a corporate culture that encourages the group is expected to be presented with not only opportunities but also challenges in 2015. by exploiting opportunities offered by the free trade zones and one belt, one road initiatives and endeavoring to achieve breakthroughs in the group s strategies of homebase port construction, overseas expansion, and advocating innovation, the group is well-placed to deliver sustainable and stable growth of its operations, thereby yielding ever-improving investment returns for our shareholders.
