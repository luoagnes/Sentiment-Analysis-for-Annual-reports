chairman s statement
i am very pleased to report to you the solid results posted by sun art retail group limited (the company , together with its subsidiaries, the group ) in 2014, which was a challenging year.
we have been able to continue to improve our bottom line while opening 49 new stores, and gaining market share again in a purely organic way, which we believe is the most profitable way of developing our business.
in 2014, www.feiniu.com started operations and has been able to attract 1,395,010 customers by the end of 2014. this is a significant achievement in this more and more competitive online retail market.
our board has also reviewed a new strategic initiative where in 2015, the two banners of the company will open a number of smaller stores with 3,000-5,000 sq.m., which we expect will help us address customer needs in core downtown areas of the major cities.
the board has recommended the payment of final dividend of hkd1,526 million, translating into hkd0.16 per share. this is in line with our long standing dividend policy.
we expect that our continuous emphasis on understanding changing customer behaviors and needs, together with the sustained investment in new systems and employee development, will maintain our competitive position and deliver value to our shareholders.
