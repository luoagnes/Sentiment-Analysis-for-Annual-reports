during the previous year, the company effectively executed the predetermined strategy. on the one hand, we focus on developing coal-fired generation units of 300mw and above in the target markets, namely the more affluent regions and regions with high economic growth rates in the prc, including eastern china, southern china and the beijing-tianjin-tangshan area. on the other hand, we endeavoured to reduce costs involved in development, construction and operation of the projects.
the company continued to pursue investment opportunities in the target markets. during the year, the company invested in cr yixing thermal power plant (2 x 60mw) in the southern part of jiangsu province, acquired certain equity interests in xingning power plant (2 x 135mw) as well as phase ii of hengfeng power plant (2 x 300mw) in guangdong and hebei province, respectively. the company is applying for government approval for a number of large generation units in the target markets. this ensures the company will continue its satisfactory growth rate, and returns on shareholders equity will be further in view of the continued shortage of thermal coal over the past year, the company timely adjusted its business strategies, including investing in mine-mouth and road-mouth power plants, conducting research and development of new types of energy and renewable energy. in 2004, we have been actively developing mine-mouth and road-mouth power plants in regions where there is an abundant supply of coal resources, such as henan province, in order to assure the supply of coal and mitigate the impact of coal price increase on earnings. following dengfeng power plant (with two generation units commencing commercial operation in july and september 2004 respectively), we invested in shouyangshan power plant and zhumadian gucheng power plant successively. these power plants are located in henan province, where there is transportation convenience and an abundant supply of coal. in addition, the company is also exploring investment opportunities in new energy and renewable energy, such as gas-fired power stations and wind power projects.

outlook for 2005 growth of the prc economy should remain rapid in 2005, so does electricity demand growth. the company will continue to capitalize on the opportunities arising from shortage of power supply in its service areas, and strive to maintain high utilization levels for our operational plants. during the first quarter of 2005, a generation unit at each of jiaozuo power plant, changshu power plant, phase ii of hengfeng power plant and yixing power plant, respectively, was commissioned ahead of schedule. in addition, a number of new generation units are expected to commence commercial operation in 2005.
in 2005, coal prices should stay at high levels. this will be a major challenge for the company. cr power will adopt active measures including developing mine-mouth projects and appropriately investing in coal mines, in order to control the supply of coal and to ensure our power plants coal costs to be below average in their respective regions.
