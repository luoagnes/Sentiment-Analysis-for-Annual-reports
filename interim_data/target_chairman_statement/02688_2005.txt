natural gas is not just one of the cleanest, safest, most efficient and economical energy sources, but also has obvious advantages in environmental and social efficacy and is more competitive in price than other clean energy sources like liquefied petroleum gas ( lpg ) and electricity. therefore, the prc central and local governments in general emphasize the use of natural gas and vigorously promote the use of natural gas throughout the country as a clean energy according to the statistics of energy research institute, national development and reform commission ( ndrc ), in 2004, the output of natural gas in the prc increased 18.5% to 40.8 billion cubic meters when compared to 2003. as forecasted by energy bureau, ndrc, the demand growth of natural gas will be well ahead of coal and oil in the prc in the future 20 years. by 2010, natural gas consumption will make up 6% 7% of the total energy consumption in the prc and reach 93.8 billion cubic meters; by 2020, natural gas consumption will further increase to 10% of the total energy consumption and reach 203.7 billion cubic at the end of 2002, the ministry of construction of the prc issued a memorandum on the opinion concerning the speeding up of the development of market economy in the public utilities sector allowing local authorities to open up the market for the investment in construction and operation of public utilities, including city gas.
foreign investors are now allowed to participate in the market by various means, such as setting up wholly-owned enterprises, equity joint ventures or operation joint ventures. in february 2005, the state council of the prc also issued opinions on encouraging the development of non-state-owned economy , which also explicitly encourages private investors and foreign investors to enter urban public utilities sector. the implementation of these prc government policies will facilitate and accelerate the healthy development of city piped natural gas market and further reduce the investment risks.
with the support of relevant policies from the government, the construction of various branch pipelines of the west-to- east project, the linking up of zhong-wu pipelines, the exploration of natural gas under seabed and imported liquefied natural gas ( lng ) projects in coastal areas have progressed smoothly. these developments, together with quickened urbanization, higher standards for urban environmental protection and higher popularity of natural gas among consumers, facilitate the rapid and continuous development of downstream natural gas business.
at present, natural gas users only account for 10% of the total urban residential gas users in the prc, and the ratio is expected to increase to 30% by 2010 and 40% by 2020, which reveal the positive market prospect of natural gas industry in the prc. the group believes that, after rapid development, the city piped gas market in the prc is entering into the stage of merges and acquisitions, which will offer good opportunities to xinao gas and other large and renowned gas operators for further development and under all the favorable conditions, we believe that the group will have better development prospects, more chances for exploring new projects and higher ability to ensure reliable gas sources. it is expected that in 2005, the group will, as always, be able to secure new quality projects in large and medium cities.
despite the huge market opportunities, we will remain prudent and conduct cautious feasibility study on each project before making any investment decision, so as to minimize investment risks and maximize 20 april 2005
