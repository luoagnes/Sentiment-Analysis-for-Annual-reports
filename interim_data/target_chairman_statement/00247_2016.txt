on the whole, the plan targets to establish a better future for the people in the central government s belt and road initiative aims to connect major asian and european economies through international cooperation, infrastructure developments, trade and investments. the belt and road initiative encourages greater circulation of trade flows and economic cooperation extending towards environmental conservation and protection, removal of investment and trade barriers as well as cultural and academic exchanges. in january 2016, asia infrastructure investment bank commenced operations and together with other supranational financial institutions such as asian development bank and the world bank, loans have been granted by these banks to finance the infrastructure development of the countries along the belt and road. hong kong has a role to play in the belt and road and can cooperate with other core regions of the belt and road to capitalise on the hong kong property market continues to consolidate as a result of economic and property-related policies. both sales volume and value showed a decrease during the financial year 20152016 when compared to a year ago. the housing policy in the policy address announced on 13th january, 2016 states that there will be a consistent supply of land in hong kong. the hksar government s effort in zoning or rezoning of sites, introducing new development areas and extending new towns should offer a solution to the long-term supply of both residential and commercial property developments.
