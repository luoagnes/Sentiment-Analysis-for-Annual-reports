chairman s statement business performance in 2012 while worldwide financial markets continued to be volatile, economic conditions in china were largely stable, with the manufacturing purchasing managers index rebounding in the fourth quarter to above 50 and the nation recording a 7.8% year-on-year growth in gross domestic production. thanks to the brilliant efforts and dedication of all employees across the group, the company reported favourable results for 2012. turnover increased by 20.0% over 2011 to hk$5,183 million, while profit after taxation attributable to shareholders amounted to hk$841 million, an increase of 18.6% as compared to 2011.
development of the city gas industry as at the end of 2012, the urbanisation ratio of china reached 52.6%, signifying that its urban population had outnumbered its rural population. it is estimated that the urbanisation ratio will continue to rise at a rate of 1% per annum. china s ongoing economic growth, rapid urbanisation and improving living standards are all favourable to the development of the city gas industry. regarding the availability of gas sources, with the increasing natural gas supply through upstream domestic exploration and foreign importation, a better balance in supply and demand is gradually achieved. as such, china s city gas industry will enjoy thriving development for many years to come.

ample sources of natural gas china consumed 106 billion cubic metres of natural gas in 2010, while gas demand in 2020 is estimated to reach 350 billion cubic metres. to realise the goal of gas supply all over china, the country is rolling out the construction of a long-distance natural gas transmission pipeline network with extensive coverage. this includes: phase i of the west-to-east gas pipeline and the sichuan-to-east gas pipeline which have been completed and operating for a number of years; phase ii of the west-to-east gas pipeline which was completed at the end of 2012; phase iii of the west-to-east gas pipeline of which construction started in october 2012; phases iv and v of the west-to-east gas pipeline for which preliminary planning has commenced; as well as phases i, ii and iii of the shaanxi-to-beijing gas pipeline, which have entered into service, among others. in addition, the china-myanmar natural gas pipeline and a number of large liquefied natural gas receiving terminals located in coastal regions will also be completed gradually. china will thus have an ample supply of natural gas, to the benefit of the long term development of the city gas industry.
