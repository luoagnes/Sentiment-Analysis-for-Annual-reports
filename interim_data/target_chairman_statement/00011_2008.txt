hong kong should maintain good growth momentum in 2008, underpinned by buoyant private consumption and solid business spending in the domestic sector and sustained economic strength on the mainland.
challenges include the risk of a further slowdown in the us economy, which will continue to cloud the outlook for exports. strong domestic demand supported by the tight labour market, low interest rates, and the ongoing weakness of the us dollar and growing strength of the renminbi are all contributing to rising inflation risk.
overall, we are cautiously optimistic for the year ahead.
economic fundamentals in hong kong and on the mainland remain sound and domestic demand is now a major impetus for growth.
we will continue to develop our key growth drivers, particularly wealth management services, commercial banking and mainland business. using our strong brand, leading market position and solid financial fundamentals as a springboard, we will take full advantage of new opportunities to expand our business.
