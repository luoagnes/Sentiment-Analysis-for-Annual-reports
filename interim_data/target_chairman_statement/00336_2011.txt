operating environment review in the year of 2010, china maintained rapid growth, with its gross domestic product growth exceeding 10%, becoming the world s second largest economy. the china domestic consumer goods market has also maintained rapid growth momentum, while the pressure of price rises is high, a series of downstream food safety incidents has once again cast a shadow on china s food and beverage industry and food additives industry. a new round of industry adjustment and consolidation is set to begin. such industry integration and negative opinions will impose adverse effect on related industries in the short and middle run. these industry adjustments, however, are viewed as positive and beneficial in the long run. and, as a leading domestic player in the flavours and fragrances industry, the group will surely benefit from the integration in the prc food and beverage industry.

future development plans the global economy is in the midst of a long recovery period, and the future growth of china s economy will be slowed as well. against such macro environments, the group must always adhere to the multi-pronged, focus growth development strategy, constructing an integrated core value chain, continuously identifying new business growth points, enhancing the group s capability in countering risks, actively construct a more natural, greener, and healthier production chain, and achieving long-term sustainable growth.
firstly, with flavours and fragrances as its core, the group will diversify into the business of new materials for cigarettes, which is represented by the rtl business, and further develop the upstream natural aromatic raw materials area. in tobacco related fields, the group will use the twelfth five-year plan and its development targets of 532 and 461 as an opportunity to further improve its industry position in the tobacco flavours market. meanwhile, the group will spare no efforts in the development of its rtl business; at this time the group will pursue the growing market of reduced tar content and harm. the long term strategy of the group, i.e. pursue the strategy of big customers, big brands , remains unchanged. we expect growth momentum in our existing flavours and fragrances business will be sustained. on the rtl side, the implementation of the second phase of the expansion project of guangdong jinye and startups of other rtl related projects will see rapid growth in in the food and beverage field, the group fully integrated the advantages of upstream natural aromatic raw materials, adhered to the development of natural, healthy and tasty local products, and provided product quality and taste solutions for local major customers; moreover, it continued to implement an overall strategy by fully leveraging its strengths in having a nationwide network for the heavy development of local small- and medium-sized customers and helping them to constantly improve product quality. certainly, the management expected that the recent food safety disturbance and the new industry standards would still have certain negative impact on relevant industries. as one of the largest local flavours and fragrances enterprises in the prc, the management and i are confident in addressing these challenges and will seize the opportunities brought from further industrial adjustment.
in the aromatic raw materials sector, huabao has continued with its commitment to the strategic development of the upstream aromatic raw materials business to create an integrated core value chain and enhance its overall competitiveness. the establishment of the bases of wuxi huahai and botswana s f&g and the successful acquisitions of qingdao qingda and yunnan huaxiangyuan as well as the establishment of yongzhou shanxiang, have greatly elevated the group s status in the integrated core value chain, as well as its capability in countering risks. furthermore, by utilizing premium upstream raw materials as a platform and combining it with the group s advantages in flavours and fragrances business, products quality and competitive advantages will be further elevated. the group s core business in flavours and fragrances is further improved.
furthermore, these upstream raw material bases also enabled the group to obtain significant market share of certain important upstream natural aromatic raw materials. in the next step, the group will continue to accelerate the development of the aromatic raw materials segment, further elevating the group s overall competitive advantages and pushing for the formation of an integrated core the chinese consumer products market is advancing to a higher level, consumers will demand for higher product taste and quality, with a tendency towards more natural products. this trend will inevitably lead to a significant increase in the value of per capita consumption of flavours and fragrances. from a long-term perspective, the global flavours and fragrances business will gradually shift its focus to asia; the integrated core value chain will enable huabao to possess a more natural, greener and healthier product system, thereby firmly capturing the opportunities of industrial upgrade to achieve greater development. the use of rtl will reduce the harm of cigarette products, and tobacco waste is the major raw material used in production of rtl; food and beverage products will be more natural and healthier with the development of upstream natural aromatic raw materials by the group. i believe, the group s future growth will be greener and healthier.
in regards to capital markets, in recent years, the financing platform for china domestic capital market has drawn increasing attentions.
in order to broaden its financing platform and increase huabao s brand awareness, the group, in line with its domestic business development, is now seeking advice with professional parties to carry out operation plans on platforms for china domestic capital markets. up to date, the group has not formulated any final opinion or concrete plans. however, it will consider both the interest of its shareholders and the development of its business and will make public the related progress, if appropriate.
in respect of m&a, the group will continue to focus on the strategy of multi-pronged, focus growth , building a new business development platform through m&a and accelerate the development of existing core businesses. in the past several years, the group has successfully carried out several m&as differing in size and has set up a team with strong m&a implementation, effective integration measures and strict internal control. in the future, the group will remain focused on domestic targets and proactively pay attention to m&a opportunities overseas to further enhance its own technological strength and product development capabilities. the group will achieve faster development by fully leveraging its financial strength and relying on the chinese market.
lastly, i would like to reiterate the group s development strategy. the group will continue to implement the multi-pronged, focus-growth development strategy. in line with its prudent corporate management approach, the group will also develop its businesses by way of combining organic growth and m&as so as to create an integrated core value chain and fully capitalize on the upcoming enormous business opportunities arising from the chinese consumer products market as a result of the next round of china s continuous growth.
