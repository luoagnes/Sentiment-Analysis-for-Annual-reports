chairman s statement 2013 was a year of challenge on the domestic and international fronts.
although the global economy was in better shape than the worst days of the 2008-2009 global nancial crisis, growth was weak due to the muted recovery of the advanced economies and the slower pace of activity expansion in the emerging markets. the uncertainties arising from us monetary and scal issues led to a bout of global nancial jitters. the nascent economic recovery in the eurozone remained fragile. on the other hand, china s economy was relatively resilient with gdp growing at 7.7%, exceeding the government s 7.5% target, and growing faster than any other major economy. under new leadership, china has initiated an era of more modest growth and is on track to steer the economy towards a more consumption-driven and sustainable economic model. it is a natural development after years of blistering growth.
hong kong registered moderate gdp growth of 2.9%, up from 1.5% a year earlier. the domestic sector held rm, with steady growth in private consumption expenditure. inbound tourism remained vibrant with overall visitor arrivals rising by 12% to another record of 54.3 million, of which 75% came from mainland china.
this thriving sector fuelled demand for hotel rooms and consumer goods. hong kong retail sales posted a respectable 11% growth rate, which suggested the local retail sector was in vibrant health. while this success was the envy of cities around the world, there is a price to pay for it too. for the rst time, we witnessed demonstrations targeted at visitors from the mainland.
on the other hand, the property markets in hong kong and china where our main business is based, were overshadowed by a raft of cooling measures imposed by respective governments, resulting in a challenging market environment. it is generally not anticipated that this policy framework will ease in the near term.
however, notwithstanding a series of headwinds, the fundamentals of hong kong and china remained solid, as reected in the steady economic growth in the respective regions in 2013. hong kong continues to be a superb business and services platform for the asian region, in particular for china.
the third plenary session of the 18th central committee held in november, 2013, afrmed china s commitment to push forward urbanization, unleash domestic demand, and to embrace market dynamics to determine resource allocation, which bodes well for the longer-term outlook for the real estate market.
the commitment to double gdp by 2020 will further propel economic growth and accelerate urbanization and wealth accumulation for the next decades. these pledges give rise to solid demand for quality urban living and unmatched shoppertainment experiences by the fast-expanding middle class. for services not available in the mainland, they will seek them in hong kong.

the agship school improvement programme, project wecan, which launched in 2011 currently covers 14 participating secondary schools, supporting more than 12,000 deserving students from underprivileged backgrounds in hong kong. more than 400 staff volunteers across the group work closely with partner schools and are continually impressed by the passion and caring from teachers. the next phase of the programme will include a total funding of more than hk$500 million over the next ve years to help approximately 150 local secondary schools through the improvement of software and hardware.
with the launch of phase two, project wecan is now the largest youth development programme for underprivileged youth ever undertaken by a private corporation in hong kong. to date, over 120 activities and programmes have been attended by more than 25,000 student participants.

annual report 2013 the wharf (holdings) limited the care-for-others spirit has long been a critical component of the group s core values. i thank all our volunteers who take ownership of the project and devote great effort to serving the community. i thank our partner, the chinese university of hong kong, which provides the necessary education software to help our schools. i also welcome mr henry poon, the retired principal of st paul s co-educational college to serve as programme director consultant for project wecan.

though the global economies have been restored to a healthier growth trajectory, 2014 will remain challenging as major advanced economies continue to work through varying scal and monetary issues. possible further tapering of various government quantitative easing programmes in major developed economies could impact capital ow reversals and asset market gyrations in emerging markets, causing uncertainty.
with a series of tough policies and local construction costs under continued upward pressure, the property markets in hong kong and china will continue to be difcult. that said, the long-term fundamentals of hong kong and china will remain solid given the steady economic growth forecasts in the respective markets.
china s growth target for this year is 7.5%, which remains unchanged from the previous two years, underlining its determination to ensure sustainable economic development. china s commitment to double 2010 gdp by 2020 is also equivalent to a sustainable economic growth of 7.5% per annum over the next seven years, signaling china s commitment to raise the quality and efciency of its economic fundamentals. the next phase of growth will continue to be powered by accelerating urbanization and domestic consumption as well as further development of the services sector. the growing middle class with rising wealth will spur demand for quality consumer goods and urban living for the next decades.
the mainland economy, being the second largest in the world, will benet hong kong. the economic fundamentals in hong kong remain positive, with low unemployment rate, positive business sentiment, resilient consumption demand, ongoing large-scale infrastructure works and a solid expansion in inbound tourism. the local economy is projected to expand by 3-4% in 2014.
the shenzhen to hong kong high-speed railway section, to be completed by 2015, will facilitate the spread of economic activities between hong kong and key cities on the mainland and deepen hong kong s economic links with the vast hinterland. when completed, the bridge to zhuhai and macao will be the strategic link to the west bank of the pearl river delta. these will continue to stimulate economic activities for our retail and personal services platform.
mr james thompson, independent non-executive director since 2001 and 74 years of age, will not seek re- election on retirement by rotation at the upcoming annual general meeting. he has given the board and me tremendous and valuable guidance over the years and we will miss his counsel. i thank him most sincerely on behalf of the company and wish him all of the very best.
on behalf of shareholders and the board, i also wish to express my heartfelt appreciation to all customers, staff and business partners for their unwavering support, enthusiasm, commitment and contribution. we will continue to rely on such support to deliver good returns on our investment.
