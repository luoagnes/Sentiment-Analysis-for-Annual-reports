during the year ended 31st march, 2002, the performance of the group has been adversely affected by the global economic downturn. hong kong still suffered from the trough of the economic cycle and the unemployment rate recorded a historic high in recent decades of 7.8%. therefore, management of the company take a pessimistic view on the future outlook for the garment manufacture and sale business.
under the circumstances, on 19th march, 2002, the company determined to sell off the garment operation and retained the business of property holding and investment in health food manufacture and sale. the sale of the group s garment operation was completed on 28th march, 2002.
the group s performance was also affected by the increase in administrative expenses of approximately hk$11 million to hk$45 million. the increase was due to the business exploring expenditures incurred as a result of the group s diversification processes.
apart from that, the sluggish property market continued to take the toll on the group s investment properties.
during the year, the group recorded a deficit arising from revaluation of investment properties of approximately hk$4 million (2001: hk$3.8 million). however, the management has exerted great effort to maintain a high occupancy ratio of the group s rental properties. in fact, the group recorded a high occupancy ratio of approximately 89% during the year (2001: 85%).

in view of the global economic downturn that continued affecting hong kong, the directors of the company take the view that hong kong will lag behind other nearby countries as hong kong has been recently ranked the most expensive country in the world. under the circumstances, the directors will focus on business opportunities in the prc which offer investment opportunities in different aspects.
health food manufacture and sale will become one of the pillar business of the group and the directors will continue to explore other complementary business in this area. the directors have also been exploring new business opportunities through different channels and contacts in the prc that will provide a stable growth in revenue and profit to the group.
as the globe is facing an economic downturn that may not have been experienced in the past decades, it is rather difficult to foresee the domain of the economic effect. in particular, the recent slump in the us stock market and the grim corporate news from the us cast doubt on the quick revival of the global economy. as the hong kong economy is at the mercy of the overseas market, the directors take a very cautious approach in the outlook of the group s overall performance.
however, the directors believe that the group will recover soon from the short pain of business restructure and will endeavour to bring long term benefit to the shareholders.

liquidity and capital structure during the year, the company issued 191,970,750 shares of hk$0.10 each in the company at a price of hk$0.12 per share by way of rights issue. the net proceeds from the rights issue of hk$21 million were used for investing in new garment manufacturing facilities in cambodia which was disposed of during the year and as general working capital of the group. generally, the group financed its operations mainly with internal resources and general banking facilities.
as at 31st march, 2002, the group s bank balances, deposits and cash amounted to approximately hk$29 million while bank loans amounted to approximately hk$14 million of which approximately hk$5 million are due within one year. interest on bank loans is charged at variable commercial rates prevailing in hong kong and the loans are denominated in hong kong dollars and accordingly, changes in foreign exchange rate would not affect the group s capital and liquidity structure.

the gearing ratio improved from 37% to 18%. in fact, the debts were completely covered by the bank balances and deposits. computation was based on total borrowings divided by shareholders funds as at 31st march, charge on group assets at 31st march, 2002, investment and leasehold properties of the group with carrying value of approximately hk$36 million and hk$1 million, respectively, together with bank deposits and other assets of the group amounting to approximately hk$11 million, were pledged to banks to secure credit facilities granted to the group and certain former subsidiaries of the group.
