7 annual report 2013 divisional and product highlights
in 2013, qq and qzone maintained their leading positions in communications and social networking in china. user account growth decelerated as users continued to shift their traffic from pc to mobile devices because fewer mobile users than pc users employ multiple accounts and mobile users usage pattern is more spread out across day parts as compared to pc users. for qq, aggregate mau increased modestly by 1% year-on-year to 808 million at the end of 2013, while pcu increased by 2% year-on-year to 180 million. during the year, we significantly expanded the mobile user base of qq with enhanced user experience and enriched services such as game center. at the end of 2013, smart device mau1 of qq increased by 74% year-on-year to 426 million. for qzone, aggregate mau increased by 4% year-on-year to 625 million at the end of 2013. the year saw increased user activity and engagement on mobile. this was evidenced by a significant growth in smart device mau of qzone, which increased by 63% year-on-year to 416 million at the end of 2013, as well as a substantial increase in photo uploads on mobile qzone.
combined mau of weixin and wechat reached 355 million at the end of 2013. during the year, weixin enjoyed rapid expansion and enhanced user engagement in china. with the launch of new services, such as game center, official accounts and weixin payment, as well as the increasing adoption of moments, weixin is evolving from a pure communications service into a multi-functional platform. in international markets, wechat achieved robust aggregate user growth, but we are increasingly focused on driving engagement in specific target geographic regions. looking ahead, we aim to further improve user engagement on weixin and wechat by enhancing the core communications and social functions. we will also leverage official accounts and weixin payment to explore o2o and mobile ecommerce opportunities in china.
for our core media platforms, qq.com, tencent microblog and tencent video, we sought to upgrade our content and enhance user experience, especially on mobile devices. for example, tencent news achieved significant user growth during the year via mobile applications and plug-ins on mobile qq and weixin. going forward, we will further develop our portfolio of mobile media applications and enhance the monetisation of our mobile media traffic. we will also invest more aggressively in video content to further expand tencent video s market presence, as we believe the online video industry is still at a formative stage and our massive media traffic provides us with competitive advantage.

in 2013, our open platforms continued to create value for the internet industry, and enjoyed significant growth in users and revenues as a result. we believe we have become the partner of choice for application developers in china, offering access to our large logged-in user base, the network effect of our leading social platforms, our targeted advertising solutions, and our proprietary cloud-based infrastructure support. we are extending our open platforms to mobile and targeting to build a cross- 1 since the fourth quarter of 2013, smart device mau of qq has been revised to denote the total number of qq mau that sent out one or more messages via mobile qq application on ios or android devices, or conducted other proactive operations via mobile qq application on ios or android devices, such as logging into game center or updating qzone, at least once during the last calendar month prior to the relevant date. comparative figures have been restated to conform to the current period s presentation.

tencent holdings limited 8 the weakness in our vas subscription services continued in 2013. this was primarily due to rapid adoption of smart phones by users, whereas our paid subscription services are traditionally focused on pc or feature phones. the weakness was also driven by our stringent measures to clean up certain user accounts acquired through mobile channels with low possibility of fee collection. to better align our vas subscription services with the mobile internet opportunities, we unified the product teams and product experiences between pc and smart phones, and introduced smart phone-oriented subscription services, such as super vip, during the year.
for online games, we consolidated our leading position in china in 2013. while major domestic pc game titles continued to deliver solid growth, we benefited significantly from increased contribution from international markets via lol, and from the launch of new domestic pc game titles. in the fast-growing mobile game market, we launched our game center on mobile qq and weixin, including a range of self-developed and third-party smart phone games. riding on the extensive user reach and social network effect offered by mobile qq and weixin, these games generated a revenue contribution of over rmb600 million for the fourth quarter of 2013, validating the distribution capabilities of our mobile platforms. we will continue to enrich our game portfolios for pc and mobile. in addition, we will strengthen our mobile distribution platforms to complement the rapid growth of our mobile games.

leveraging the growth of our media platforms and social platforms, our online advertising business expanded further in 2013, with revenue growth across the brand display and performance display categories. for brand display advertising, revenues from our online video platform achieved strong growth, driven by increased inventories, improved pricing and enhanced recognition from advertisers. traditional brand advertising also registered solid revenue growth. for performance display advertising, revenues from our social platforms benefited from growth in impression volume and improved targeting. for search advertising, revenues declined as we transferred our search business to sogou in september 2013. we believe sogou is well- positioned to grow its share in the pc and mobile search market after the completion of its integration with soso towards the end of 2013.
longer term, we believe the fast-growing user base and traffic of our mobile platforms will increasingly become an attractive proposition for advertisers. we are exploring different formats of mobile advertising on our platforms to capture the emerging in 2013, our principal ecommerce transactions business experienced strong growth in transaction volume and revenues as we enhanced our geographic presence, expanded our product range and improved our ecommerce infrastructure. our marketplaces also registered growth in fee income as we improved product selection and customer service.
