chairman s statement 2005 was a year in which the group s hong kong office properties began to emerge from the negative rental reversion cycle of the preceding several years. the growing importance of hong kong as a capital fund-raising centre for greater china enterprises has led to a major increase in investment banking activities. the strong build- up of wealth in the asia region in recent years and favourable policies of the hong kong government have also supported an accelerating growth of the wealth at the same time, china trade has also sustained a healthy level of growth. these significant factors, amidst the growth in the economy of hong kong, have created strong demand for office space in hong kong at a time when the volume of new supply has actually been decreasing. the resulting shortage has led to a jump in office rent rates during 2005. in the two preceding years we adopted a disciplined leasing strategy whereby we only entered into those leasing transactions that have no restrictions on the upward rental reversionary potential for the landlord. as a result of this strategy, though the vacancy rate at our flagship property citibank plaza was temporarily higher than the market average in 2005, we have placed ourselves in a strong position to benefit from the current upturn in rent rates.
another of the group s major long term investment project, langham place urban renewal development, which was completed in the second half of 2004, made its first full-year revenue contribution to the group in 2005. it has now firmly established itself as a new hub for retailing and commerce in the busy district of mongkok. this landmark development has also brought about a visible upgrade of commercial activities in the neighbourhood. occupancy at the langham place mall remained at a very high level throughout the year. four floors of the office tower were contracted for disposal and approximately 300,000 sq. ft. in the lower portion was let up to year-end 2005. the remainder has been put into an active kowloon office leasing market which is in short supply. the rental income from the langham place mall and office tower will further strengthen the group s recurring income base and continuously contribute to the group s long term results.
the continued economic growth in hong kong and close association with the mainland has underpinned the performance of our hong kong hotels. the strong demand from high yielding international business travelers led to double-digit revpar growth at langham hotel, hong kong and eaton hotel in 2005. although the growth of mainland visitor arrivals slowed down in 2005, it had not created adverse impact on our business, as that segment only makes up a small proportion of our total revenues. the langham place hotel made its first full-year contribution in 2005 and its performance outgrew our expectation. the performance of our overseas hotels in 2005 was uneven partly because of the effects of the re-branding exercise. the lag in contributions of the overseas hotels as a whole was however more than made up for by the increased contributions from the hong kong hotels.
in the year, the group adopted a number of revised and new hong kong financial reporting standards and hong kong accounting standards and interpretations, which resulted in some very significant changes to our reported results for 2005. some of the important items include a hk$12,867 million surplus on revaluation of our investment properties as at 31st december 2005 and a related hk$2,163 million deferred taxation charge, as well as a hk$155 million depreciation charge on hotel buildings. further explanations and details of the new hkfrss and their impacts are shown in note (3) to the 1 rental properties hong kong rental properties (a) rental income gross rental income citibank plaza 330.5 335.3 great eagle centre 54.6 53.0 langham place 362.6 37.2 eaton houses 35.3 29.5 convention plaza apartments 3.1 2.6 others 2.4 5.0 (b)occupancy and rental trend occupancy at 31st december 2005 office commercial residential citibank plaza 86.1% 100.0% great eagle centre 96.4% 100.0% langham place 46.7% 98.5% convention plaza apartments 100.0% eaton houses 84.7% following the upward trend in the first half of 2005, rent rates of hong kong office properties continued to climb at a fast pace in the second half. the trend was particularly acute in the central business district where a small amount of new supply of office space was far outstripped by very strong demand from the banking and fund management sectors. the vacancy rates of grade-a office properties in hong kong dropped significantly across the board during 2005. the year on year increase in spot rent rates during 2005 was as much as 70% at some of the prime buildings in central.
occupancy at citibank plaza improved from 80.9% at the beginning of 2005 to 86.1% at 31st december 2005. the year-end occupancy level was below the core central market average as a result of our selective leasing strategy to optimize the rental rates of individual leases in anticipation of further rise in rent rates at the expense of a slower pace of letting. as rent rates have continued to rise in 2006, we believe this strategy would have a positive impact on our income in the medium term. as reported in our interim results, the gross rental income from citibank plaza of hk$146.6 million for the first 6 months of 2005 was 21.2% lower than that of the corresponding period in 2004. however with the rapid rise in achieved rent rates, citibank plaza has solidly entered a positive rental reversion cycle in the second half of 2005. together with a higher occupancy rate, the rental income of citibank plaza for the second half of 2005 made up for a lot of the slack of the first half, so much so that its full-year income of hk$330.5 million was almost level with that of hk$335.3 million for 2004.
the great eagle centre offices remained well occupied during 2005 with a year-end occupancy rate of 96.4% as compared to 98.9% as at 31st december 2004. as the renewal of the larger tenancies in 2005 took place earlier in the year at lower rent rates, the rental income from great eagle centre of hk$54.6 million for 2005 was only marginally higher than that of hk$53.0 million the langham place mall had its first full year of operations in 2005. with its unique design and its strategic location, it has become an important shopping centre in kowloon as well as a popular tourists spot.
occupancy of the mall at the end of 2005 was at a high level of 98.5%. we are in the process of adjusting the tenant mix to enhance the mall s attraction to shoppers.
out of the 772,500 sq. ft. of space in the langham place office tower, approximately 327,900 sq. ft. or 46.7% were leased as at 31st december 2005. to reduce the gearing ratio of our group, four floors comprising approximately 69,600 sq. ft. were contracted for disposal. completion of disposal of two floors took place in 2005, with the remaining two floors in 2006. in view of the strong demand for quality office space for letting, we have put up the remaining 375,000 sq. ft., mainly in the high and top zones of the tower, for leasing in early 2006. the initial market response has been encouraging. in all, the langham place mall and office tower contributed hk$362.6 million in gross rental income in 2005, as compared to hk$37.2 million the eaton house furnished apartments, which were reclassified as investment properties in financial year 2005, achieved an average occupancy of 84.2% in 2005 as compared with 81.6% in 2004. rental income increased by 20% from hk$29.5 million in 2004 to hk$35.3 million in 2005, mainly due to strong demand from the corporate segment.
u.s. commercial properties net rental income from the u.s. office portfolio decreased by 30% to hk$83.8 million in 2005 from hk$119.4 million in 2004, mainly because of the reduction in income resulting from the sale of 888 west sixth street in los angeles in september 2004.
the california markets which bottomed-out in 2004 are experiencing favorable improvement in rental rates, with rates increased by 10% in 2005. however, since rental rates are still below historic levels, there should be some negative rental rate reversions continuing in 2006.
on 20th december 2005, we acquired a class-a suburban office building located at 2700 ygnacio valley road, in walnut creek, california. the property has 106,000 sq. ft. in gross floor area and was 87% occupied. the purchase consideration was us$22.25 2005 was a milestone year which marked the completion of the langham re-branding exercise for the group s five-star hotels. we continued efforts to reinforce langham as a global luxury hotel brand with the launch of various marketing initiatives throughout the year. to expand our customer reach, we also entered into a number of loyalty, airline and travel consortia partnership programs as well as developed an effective e-business platform to drive web business.
our strategic focus remains in building our brand and driving greater global recognition of our luxury position.

notwithstanding the relatively significant rise in office rent rates in hong kong during the past year, the shortage of new supply, especially in the key commercial districts, should lead to further appreciation in rental values. we have the stock available in citibank plaza and langham place office tower to fully capitalize on this office bull market.
the business momentum at our three hotels in hong kong has been favourable in recent months. the sustained surge in business travel is supporting a continued growth in room rates. we are therefore expecting another strong performance of our hong kong hotels in 2006. after two years of brand building, the langham name has been gaining recognition in the international travel market. we expect to see further improvement in the results of the langham hotels in london and boston after they have emerged from the effects of re-branding and other negative international events. the two southern hemisphere hotels are expected to take some more time to improve their the significant rise in interest rates during the past year had adversely affected the group s financial results, though the impact was mitigated by the incremental revenue from langham place. looking forward, interest rates are likely to move further upwards in the coming months. with the anticipated substantial increase in rental revenue from our hong kong rental and hotel properties, our cashflow should stay at a healthy position. nonetheless, we remain committed to our goal to significantly reduce our financial gearing through asset divestiture, so as to enhance our financial maneuverability. we are at present diligently pursuing various alternatives to achieve that objective and will keep shareholders informed as and when appropriate.
