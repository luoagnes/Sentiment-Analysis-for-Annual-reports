chairman s statement it is my great pleasure to report to our shareholders that kingboard chemical holdings limited ( the group ) delivered satisfactory results for the financial year ended 31 december 2012. the business operating environment was extremely challenging for the group during the year. against the strong headwind caused by the european sovereign debt crisis and the slow us economic recovery, global demand for electronic products remained soft in 2012. as a result, the business performance of the laminate and printed circuit board ( pcb ) divisions was dampened by market sentiment.
meanwhile, chemical prices were dragged down by slower domestic demand in china. however, the new phenolacetone plant, in yangzhou, jiangsu province delivered profitable earnings upon commencement of production which fueled growth for the chemical division in the second half of 2012.
with regards to the property division, sales revenue from our first residential development project shanghai kingboard yu garden was recognized by the group in 2012. our investment properties continued to bring in rental income increase for the group. hence, property division s contribution achieved remarkable growth in 2012.
business review (continued) on the back of our solid financial strength and proven management team, the group has built up an excellent business model with a balanced portfolio yielding diverse income streams. all core business divisions continued to deliver profitable results. group revenue increased by 2% to hk$37,290.3 million while net profit declined by 19% to hk$2,097 million, basic earnings per share was hk$2.454. the group maintained our robust financial position.
the board proposed a final dividend of hk42 cents per share, together with the interim dividend of hk10 cents per share paid in september 2012, constitutes a total dividend per share of hk52 cents, representing a payout ratio of 21%.

the global electronics market was highly competitive in 2012. although shipment volume and capacity utilization of laminates improved marginally for the laminates division against last year but the average selling price of laminates products showed a downtrend due to softer copper prices. the laminates division successfully expanded in the china domestic market with sales denominated in renminbi ( rmb ) accounting for 50% of the division s total revenue. turnover (including inter-segment sales) for the laminate division decreased 6% against the previous year to hk$12,941.3 million. volume sales increased 1% from last year and average monthly shipment reached 8.57 million square metres. earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation ( ebitda ) decreased 16% to hk$2,104.5 million.
similar to the laminates division, the performance of the pcb division was also affected by weaker demand for electronic products. turnover for the pcb division declined by 11% to hk$7,253.3 million and ebitda decreased 8% to hk$971.9 million. the group has allocated additional resources to expand its high density interconnect ( hdi ) pcb production capacity, and gain market share in this market segment by ongoing technology and capability enhancement. hdi pcb sales accounted for 21% (2011:17%) of pcb division sales and generated good earnings contribution to the division.

despite lower chemical products prices during the year, our new phenol acetone plant at yangzhou, jiangsu province with an annual capacity of 300,000 metric tonnes generated profit contribution for the group in the second half of 2012, and the huizhou phenolacetone plant in guangdong province continued to deliver excellent performance. the group s other chemical projects including xingtai cokemethanol plant in hebei province as well as hengyang caustic soda plant in hunan province also delivered stable earnings for the group. turnover (including inter-segment sales) for the chemical division increased 3% to hk$17,557.8 million while ebitda decreased by 28% to hk$1,519.7 million. share of associates results (the bulk of which was contributed by our natural gas based methanol joint venture with china bluechemical limited) decreased by 17% to hk$215.5 million as a result of lower methanol selling prices against last year.
