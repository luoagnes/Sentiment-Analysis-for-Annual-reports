market overview and operating
despite the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) and its ramifications on the chinese economy in 2003, china s gross domestic product ( gdp ) grew by 9.1% over that of 2002, which has been the fastest growth rate since 1997.
investment in property development, witnessing the highest growth rate since 1998, reached 30% as compared to that of 2002. the rapidly growing economy, together with the increasing personal income of the people and the potential demand attributed by the people s desire to improve their living standards contributed immensely to the robust growth of the china s favourable factors such as the continuous growth in china s economy, the rise in personal income, wealth and consumption power as well as the desire in property investments, all helped to propel the demand for quality residential properties in china.
the wealth effect as a result of the strong economic growth spurred the demand for quality homes. this phenomenon is especially prominent in china s major cities. leveraging on its extensive experience, the group established solid reputation in the property industry in guangzhou. to capture the enormous opportunities brought forth by the strong economic growth in china, the group has commenced its cross-regional investments in 2002. embracing its development strategy, the group continued to implement various quality and large-scale property development projects in strategically selected cities such as beijing, tianjin, shanghai and guangzhou in 2003.

guangzhou s gdp growth in 2003 reached its highest in eight years at 15%. market demand continued to record a stable growth with transaction areas of commodity property amounting to 9.07 million sq.m., representing a year-on-year increase of 14.1% as compared to 2002.
focusing on tianhe sports centre as a central point, the guangzhou municipal government has been actively adopting a development strategy in developing to expand eastward and southward in recent years. the group s property development is well in line with the government s strategy. the group in 2003 benefited from the commencement and completion of construction of various large-scale infrastructure projects. in light of the commencement of construction of the metro line no. 3, the relocation of the guangzhou exchange expo to the guangzhou international convention and exhibition center as well as the commencement of construction of the guangzhou university project , it is expected that the pedestrian flow in the southern part of guangzhou will grow remarkably. the group s various property developments, namely pleasant view garden and huanan new city together with regal riviera, performed impressively. in addition, as far as the eastern part of guangzhou is concerned, further enhancement of the guangzhou science city and the commencement of the surveying work of the metro line no. 5 will further improve the competitiveness of gallopade park and huajing new city.
while the property market in guangzhou is mature and there is continuous growth in demand, market supply remains sufficient.

the gdp of beijing in 2003 surged by 11% as compared to 2002, with the sales of various commodity properties amounting to 15.67 million sq. m.. the success in combating sars bolstered the people s confidence in property investment and home buying in beijing. total investment in residential buildings amounted to rmb69.24 billion, representing an increase of 9.1% as compared with that in 2002. as the preparation for the olympic games has gone well underway in beijing and the construction of various infrastructure projects, such as sports centers, railways and public transportation system has already commenced, all of these factors stimulated a positive effect on the property market in 2003. in addition, the infrastructure development in relation to the central business district ( cbd ) in beijing hogged the limelight in the market. the group s three property developments, namely beijing regal court, citt eterna and fresh life garden, are all located in the peripheral areas of cbd.
the pre-sale of all three property developments commenced in 2003 and recorded promising sales performance.
opportunities as well as challenges remained as far as government policies are concerned. the implementation of land use planning regulations in 2003 stipulated a tight regulation on the land supply as well as the abolishment of sale of land agreements, which limited property developer s ability in acquiring quality land lots, yet benefiting those developers with considerable land reserves. in addition, the government also tightened the pre-sale criteria of commodity properties, which in turn, increase the capital requirement for property developers.
lastly, the legal approval of implementation measures for resale of public housing in open market of beijing city also enabled its people to resell the relatively cheaply acquired government allocated public housing in the market. this plan has a positive impact on the people s wealth, which in turn stimulates sales in the property market. overall, the new government policies introduced in 2003 expedited the group s business development shanghai s gdp increased by 12% as compared to that of 2002.
the implementation of a series of city planning measures has accelerated the pace in the development of key infrastructure projects and propelled the growth of the property sector in the metro and surrounding areas. the 2010 world expo and the massive influx of foreign funds promoted the speedy yet healthy development of shanghai. rosy expectations remain in the property industry in shanghai. the investments in commodity properties totalled rmb90.12 billion, representing an increase of 20% as compared to that of 2002 and the fastest growth across all industries. total sales of commodity properties amounted to 22.25 million sq. m. and the average price increased by 21%, making shanghai one of the cities with the fastest growth in property prices. the group acquired two land lots in shanghai in 2002 and 2003 respectively. looking ahead, solid fundamentals underlying the property industry in shanghai provided the group with ample room for growth in 2004.

the gdp increased by 15% in 2003 as compared to that of last year and sales of commodity properties reached unprecedented levels. sales of commodity properties amounted to 10.22 million sq. m., which increased by 55% as compared to last year s.

as compared to last year.

china s rapid economic growth will further increase personal income of its people and enhance the demand for improving living standards and property investments. overall, the momentum in the property industry will remain strong in the foreseeable future. given the tremendous room for growth in china s property industry, the group will continue to strengthen its established brand name and accelerate its pace of in addition to its existing property portfolio, the group will seize every opportunity to further expand its business developments.
in 2004, the group will launch its various property developments in guangzhou, namely, gallopade park south court, huanan new city, pleasant view garden, huajing new city fragrant garden and regal riviera. in beijing, in addition to those which the group has already launched in the market, such as central zone of fresh life garden, beijing regal court zone b and citt eterna phase i, the group will further introduce the eastern zone of fresh life garden and citt eterna phase ii. the pre-sale of the group s project developments in shanghai and tianjin is also expected to commence in 2004. barring unforeseen circumstances, it is expected that the group will perform reasonably well in 2004.
