business review and outlook during the year under review, the fi nancial tsunami originated from the united states in 2007 continued to affect the global economy and resulted in the collapse of global stock markets in september 2008 and the world-wide credit crunch in the fi rst half of 2009. the economies of prc and hong kong have been affected, with the imports and exports sector being hit hard. nonetheless, prc government has adopted a series of measures to tackle the diffi culties brought along by the fi nancial tsunami, including a proactive fi scal policy, a moderately loose monetary policy, and a stimulus package of rmb4 trillion. these measures have obtained initial success ebit increased 8% to for fi nancial year 200809 the average daily traffic and toll revenue of gs superhighway had been gradually rebounding after the completion of the maintenance and improvement works of its north-bound lanes of the xintang to dongguan section in july 2008. however, owing to the slump in import and export trades of guangdong and the green- lane policy, the average daily traffi c of gs superhighway for the year recorded a minor decrease as compared to last year. for the breakdown, the traffi c and toll revenue from class 1 small cars had reached a record high level since the opening of gs superhighway, while that from classes 4 and 5 commercial vehicles had stabilized after a drop in the fi rst quarter of 2009. currently, the daily toll revenue has rebounded to a level comparable to that of 2006 when the historical high of daily toll revenue was recorded. nonetheless, the group believes that with its strategic location and connecting highway network well established over the past decade, gs superhighway will continue to be the main artery within the region.
the sustaining growth in traffi c and toll revenue of phase i west was offset by the slump in import and export trades of guangdong, the loss of traffic due to the mutual recognition of vehicles annual passes between guangzhou and foshan, and the higher base value resulting from the substantial growth in traffic and toll revenue of phase i west last year after esw ring road became toll-free in september 2007.
it was announced in september 2008 that for the disclosed reasons, the group entered into agreements with the same joint venture partner as phase i west to increase the project investment costs for phase ii west and phase iii west and correspondingly to increase the group s share of the additional capital by an approximate total amount of rmb812 million. the estimated total amount of project investment costs for phase ii west and phase iii west was increased to rmb12.8 billion. the agreements are being processed by the relevant authorities. it is currently planned to complete phase ii west by the end of june 2010 and to commence construction of phase iii west in 2010 with completion in approximately 3 to 4 years. upon the completion of phase ii west and phase iii west, the total length of toll expressways invested by the group will be expanded by about 60% to around 220 km. in view of the rapid urbanization, fast growing economic development and transportation demand of the western bank of the prd region, the group believes that all these will create synergy for the western delta route as soon as it is fully completed.
following the announcement of a series of urban integration cooperation between guangzhou and foshan, the pace of economic integration of the prd region will be accelerated. the group believes that this will foster the economic development of the prd region, in particular the western bank, and the group s highway network within the region will benefi t.
