during the year under review, global economic and political uncertainties continued to weigh on the world economy. the us interest rate hike cycle, the new presidency of the us, and brexit have casted doubt to the recovery of global economy.
on the contrary, the prc economy continued to grow healthily. proactive fiscal and monetary policies were implemented by the prc government to boost domestic consumption and largescale infrastructure investments to support the local economy, which achieved gdp growth of 6.7% in 2016 within the governments target range of 6.5% to 7.0%. such growth momentum carried over to the first and second quarters of 2017, with gdp growth rates both reaching 6.9% 
during the year under review, the aggregate average daily toll revenue of the gs superhighway and the western delta route grew 8% yoy to rmb12.5 million and the aggregate total toll revenue amounted to rmb4,579 million.
the average daily toll revenue and average daily full-length equivalent traffic of the gs superhighway increased by 6% and 8% yoy to rmb9.2 million and 99,000 vehicles respectively, indicating that growth momentum is persistent. the average daily toll revenue and average daily full-length equivalent traffic of the western delta route reached historical high and grew 15% and 17% yoy to rmb3.4 million and 47,000 vehicles respectively.

the group believes that promoting sustainability is as important as achieving long-term business growth. it is committed to continuous efforts to maintain a high degree of sustainability in its operations. moreover, it values opportunities to learn more about the needs and expectations of the communities in which it operates, as well as those of other stakeholders. the group has established a formal stakeholder engagement process and a sustainability steering committee to strengthen its managements efforts to promote sustainability through good corporate governance, environmental protection, community investment and workplace practices.
to demonstrate its commitment to transparency and accountability to its stakeholders, the company will issue an independently verified sustainability report under the environmental, social and governance (esg) reporting guide of the stock exchange. the report will present its company-wide commitment to sustainable development during the year under review, and it will cover the significant economic, environmental and social achievements and impact arising from the activities of the group and its jvs.

given the volatile global market environment, recovery of the world economy has been slower than expected. the rise of protectionism and de-globalisation around the globe, policies under the new us presidency, the pace of us interest rate hike, the unclear brexit process, and upcoming elections across europe will all impact the growth of global economy. the group will closely monitor the evolving market environment and be prepared to face various challenges ahead.
in view of the unstable global economic environment, the prc government continues to transform structurally to a consumption-driven, innovative, technology-advanced and environmentallysustainable growth economy. in order to support its initiative to sustain gdp growth, the prc government is striking a balance between restricting credit in speculative buying to curb asset bubbles while supporting the property market with domestic consumption. the governments continuous efforts towards reducing taxes and levies, deepening supply-side structural reform, liberalizing financial services and internationalizing rmb will altogether provide a healthy and steady growth driver to the prc economic development.
the belt and road initiative strategically connects prc, asean, middle east, as well as central and eastern european countries through international co-operation and infrastructure projects. it encourages free flows of information, finance and goods by gradually removing investment and trade barriers. in the long run, it will promote mutual trust and co-development in the areas of economics, finance, transport, tourism, technology and academy which will ultimately result in prosperity of the nations along the regions.
in addition, the strategic regional development scheme guangdong-hong kong-macao bay area (bay area), which was tailor-made by the prc government as part of the 13th five-year plan, is designed to strengthen infrastructure linkages and stimulate economic cooperation among guangdong-hong kong-macao region. it is expected that the gs superhighway and the western delta route can benefit from the fostered economic development. hong kong can leverage on its advantage as an international and domestic financial hub to capitalize the opportunities arising from the belt and road and bay area initiatives. furthermore, the recent admission of hong kong as a new member of the asian infrastructure investment bank will further reinforce its position as a premier international financial centre.
the registered car population of guangdong continued to record healthy growth, increasing by 14% yoy and reaching a new record high of 16.8 million vehicles at the end of 2016. the growth in demand for road usage continues to outpace the growth of expressway length. these, together with the prosperous economic development of the prd are expected to sustain growth of the 
growth momentum of the gs superhighway and the western delta route persists. the western delta route is the most direct and convenient artery in the regional expressway network that covers the most prosperous and populous cities on the western bank of the prd, including guangzhou, foshan, zhongshan and zhuhai. it offers a convenient access to the hengqin statelevel strategic new zone, and via its connection with the forthcoming hzm bridge to hong kong.
upon completion of the hzm bridge, traffic flow to and fro hong kong and western prd will be further stimulated. this, together with the strategic bay area initiative, is expected to facilitate the urbanization pace of cities in the western prd region, which will help lift economic growth of the region and benefit the group in the long term.
