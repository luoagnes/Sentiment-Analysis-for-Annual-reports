as at the end of 2014, our attributable operational generation capacity of power plants amounted to 31,331mw, representing an increase of about 16.4% over 26,921mw as at the end of 2013; subsidiary power plants recorded a total gross generation volume of 140,068,174 mwh, increased by 5.1% as compared to 133,247,814 mwh in 2013; subsidiary power plants recorded a total net generation volume of 132,036,399 mwh, increased by 5.3% as compared to 125,447,662 mwh in 2013.
(1) coal-fired power business as at the end of 2014, our attributable coal-fired operating generation capacity was 27,420mw, accounting for 87.5% of our total attributable generation capacity. during the year, nine large, highly efficient coal-fired generation units were put into operation, resulted in an increase in the total attributable operating generation capacity by 3,980 mw.
due to a slowdown in power consumption, rapid growth in hydropower generation and other factors, the average utilisation hours for coal-fired generation units in china decreased by 314 hours or 6.3% year on year to 4,706 hours.
our 33 coal-fired generation units, which were fully operational during the year, had 5,325 hours of average full- load equivalent utilisation hours, exceeding the national average level by 619 hours. this was because most of our subsidiary power plants comprise of highly efficient large generation units, and were mainly located in areas with relatively strong demand for electricity, thus possessing certain market advantages.
(2) coal-mining business due to the slowdown in china s macroeconomic growth in 2014 as well as the economic transition and industrial restructuring in the country, supply and demand in the coal market maintained an easing trend in general, while coal prices continued to drop. in response to such circumstances, we focused our efforts in promoting sales while adjusting production according to sales, adopted one mine, one policy to facilitate differentiated treatment, and strictly controlled costs.

we respond to our shareholders and investors proactively, actively pursued a high quality and healthy development as well as accelerated structured optimization and project approvals to continuously create value for shareholders and investors. in 2014, we made great progress in coal- fired project approvals and obtained approvals for total capacity of 3,320mw throughout the year.
approvals for wind power projects reached a new record with an approved capacity of more than we committed to build an environmentally-friendly enterprise, and strived to develop clean energy and recycling economic projects to improve energy utilization efficiency and clean power generation level. as at the end of 2014, our clean and renewable energy accounted for 12.5% of our total attributable operational generation capacity, representing an increase of 0.5 percentage point as compared to 12% at the end of 2013.
we continued to invest in technical reform projects of energy conservation and emission reduction, and implemented over 100 technical reform projects of energy conservation during the year. in 2014, the average net generation standard coal consumption rate in our coal-fired power plants was 311.70 gkwh, 3.49 gkwh or 1.1% lower as compared to 315.19 g kwh in 2013.
construction, transformation, operation, maintenance and management of environmental protection facilities were strengthened continuously, total investment in energy conservation and emission reduction, technical reforms and installation of environmental protection facilities during the year amounted to rmb1.662 billion. as at the end of 2014, apart from a 200mw generation unit at tangshan thermal power plant and two 140mw generation units at jiaozuo thermal power plant which are intended to be closed down and a 200mw generation unit at shenhai thermal power plant in shenyang which is currently under renovation, all other generation units of subsidiary coal-fired power plants have installed desulfurization facilities complying with the national emission standards. except for the above-mentioned generation units which are intended to be demolished in the short term, all other generation units of subsidiary coal-fired power plants have installed denitrification facilities complying with national emission standards. as at the end of 2014, 94.3% of the generation units of subsidiary power plants used bag-type dust precipitators or other advanced technology encouraged by the government for ash removal. in 2014, the sulphur dioxide emission level in subsidiary coal-fired power plants was 25% lower than the previous year, the reduction level of nitrogen oxide and fly ash was nearly 50% year-on-year. the consolidated energy consumption per rmb10,000 turnover rate (in constant currency) fell by 8.1% year-on-year for coal- fired power generation. among these projects, the no.1 generation unit at nansha thermal power plant in guangzhou was one of the 13 environmental pilot-run projects, installed with ultra-clean technology, emission standards for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and fly ash are lower than the standards for gas-fired generation units.
we steadily promoted the construction of an enterprise with inherent safety to safeguard the safety of our employees and the community. we always took production safety as top priority, and established the cr power environment health and safety department to coordinate and manage safe production, occupational health, environmental protection, energy conservation and emission reduction, in 2014, the company invested rmb560 million in production safety, increased by 24.4% as compared to rmb450 million in 2013. no safety incident of major scale or above had occurred by our subsidiaries, the overall production safety condition was stable.

outlook for 2015 in the likelihood of a slowdown in the growth of demand for electricity, increasing pressure in environmental protection and a market-oriented reform, the growth rate of national power consumption in 2015 is not likely to improve significantly. with total output easing and the structural surplus in the coal market, it will be difficult for coal prices to rebound from current low levels in near future.
in 2015, we will continue optimizing the business mix and existing assets and innovating business model, to drive cr power to realize valuable growth and sustainable development. we will continue to deeply promote lean management, enhance the overall operational efficiency and management level of the company, to further improve and optimize various production and operation indicators as well as maintain and increase the value of assets. we will continue to actively promote energy conservation and emissions reduction through increase of investment and technology. we continuously improve risk management and control, optimize risk prevention system, strengthen discipline inspection and audit functions, and ensure a sound operation in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
