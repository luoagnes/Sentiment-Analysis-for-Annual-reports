the financial year 200607 was a fruitful year for the group. the step-up in the overall performance was mainly attributable to the substantial increase in retail and wholesale volume. during the year, the buoyant stock markets of hong kong and the prc have increased the income of consumers. the growth in household income and consumer spending boosted the demand for luxury products such as jewellery. hence, the prosperous economy of hong kong and the fast growing prc market offered robust growth momentum to the retail market of hong kong as well as the sales of luk fook.
meanwhile, the rising tourist arrivals in hong kong also led to a rapid increase in consumer expenditure. according to the figures from the hong kong tourism board ( hktb ), the overall tourist arrivals rose by 8.1% from 2005 to approximately 25 million in 2006. the number of prc tourists, which accounted for more than half of total arrivals, reached 13.5 million in 2006, expanding at a rate of 8.4% from a year figures from the hktb also showed that the total expenditure associated to inbound tourism recorded an increase of 12.7% to hk$119.43 billion in 2006, exceeding the original forecast by more than hk$4.7 billion as compared to 2005. through the further relaxation of the individual travel scheme, more prc consumers are allowed to travel to hong kong, aided by the appreciation of renminbi against hong kong dollars, hong kong s retail sector and our business were hong kong market as at 31st march 2007, the group operates 24 retail outlets under the brand name of luk fook in hong kong. the group has also established a stylish and trendy product line, ice g. , to cater the younger customers tastes. apart from the ice g. counters in luk fook jewellery shops, the group currently operates 1 ice g. shop in sheung shui.

the group operates its prc retail business mainly through brand licensing services. adopting licensing business in the prc allows us to diversify operating risks and minimize the costs for setting up outlets in the vast mainland regions where different norms and rules might be applied on jewellery operators.
during the year under review, the group continued to fortify its licensing penetration into the prc market while spotting out favorable locations to establish self-operated shops. as at 31st march 2007, we have over 270 licensee shops in the prc, spreading across as many as 29 provinces and 113 cities. footprints of luk fook are found in big cities such as shanghai, beijing, shenzhen, guangzhou.
we have also enlarged our parameters to more interior areas including inner mongolia, lanzhou, urumchi, xinjiang, etc.
during the year, the group established 3 self-operated shops in beijing in line with our strategy to expand in the prc market.

with the thriving macau economy, significant foreign investments flowed into macau, boosting the gaming, tourism, property and retail markets. many infrastructure projects such as hotels, resorts, real estates and large scale shopping arcades are under construction.
fuelled by the growing number of visitors to macau and the increasing consumption of visitors, the retail market in macau has been flourished. the group currently has 2 shops located at the main streets of macau, which are hot spots for tourists and residents.

in line with our corporate goal of brand of hong kong sparkling the world , extending our geographical reach in the global markets remained our focus during the year. there are currently 3 retail outlets in canada under the brand name of luk fook, of which 2 shops were switched to be operated under licensing mode in 2006.
subsequent to the group s successful move into the canadian market, the group further tapped into the north american market in june 2006 to launch a new brand luvina jewelers in the united states, signifying the group s first step into a new overseas market.

the group s remarkable financial performance has proven the financial year of 200607 a year of success. as we always believe that there are huge potentials for long-term growth in the prc market, we will penetrate unremittingly into the prc market while consolidating our existing markets and tapping into new markets.
with the vast business opportunities in the prc, we will continue to select carefully suitable licensing partners for setting up retail outlets and ensure that they offer the best products, designs and services to customers. we will continue to impose stringent quality control on the products sold in our licensee shops and provide technical support and consultancy services to all of the licensed jewelers in the prc.
on the other hand, the group has also been watching closely the macau market and is set to open another luk fook branch in macau s venetian macao-resort hotel, which has the world s largest casino. the group remains confident that the new shop will grasp the business opportunities arisen from the operation of the hotel in mid 2007 and achieve satisfactory growth to our sales performance in macau.
