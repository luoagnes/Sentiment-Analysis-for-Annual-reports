in february 2013, the government announced the implementation of double stamp duty measures. when the residential properties (first-hand sales) ordinance came into effect in april, most developers deferred their sales launches so as to adapt to the new provisions. the resulting fall in both demand and supply has led to a significant decrease in first-hand residential sales. the group took the lead to prepare appropriate sales brochures and meet the new transparency requirements, enabling it to maintain the sale of properties seamlessly. consequently, up to the end of last year, the group was the developer that had the most first-hand project launches in hong kong since the implementation of the new ordinance. the group was also one of the developers with the highest property sales in hong kong for the year under review.

during the year under review, the group launched an array of residential developments for pre-sale including high place at kowloon city, high point at cheung sha wan, high park at boundary street and the hemispheres at north point, as well as green code at fanling which is developed by the group s associate hong kong ferry (holdings) company limited. all these developments have sold well, which demonstrates that the group s small- to medium-sized units of superior quality are highly sought after by the local end-users. for instance, green code at fanling was launched in march 2013 with nearly 95% of its total 728 residential units pre-sold by the end of the year. together with other popular developments such as the reach in yuen long, double cove phase 1 in ma on shan, 39 conduit road at mid-levels and hill paramount in shatin, the group sold an attributable total of hk$7,389 million worth of hong kong residences for the year ended 31 december 2013.
the group was also actively marketing its office and industrial developments, which are not affected by the residential properties (first-hand sales) ordinance . global trade square at wong chuk hang, launched in april 2013, was almost sold out by the end of the year. to follow, global gateway tower at 63 wing hong street, cheung sha wan, was put up for sale in december 2013. the entire 110,000-square-foot development of kowloon building was disposed of during the year. proceeds arising from these disposals of commercial developments and investment properties totalled hk$3,107 million. including the aforesaid residential sales revenue, the group sold an attributable total of hk$10,496 million worth of properties for the year under review.
following the end of this financial year, the group released double cove starview (double cove phase 2) for pre-sale. for the first four batches of residential units launched, over 92% of their total 823 units was sold in just two weeks. together with the sales of other projects, the total attributable contracted sales in hong kong for the first two months of 2014 exceeded hk$3,600 million.

on the basis of the government s latest city planning, the expected gross floor areas are shown as follows: (7) newly-acquired urban redevelopment projects with over 20% but less than 80% ownership secured the group has other acquisitions in progress, involving 41 projects located in prime urban areas in hong kong and kowloon. currently, ownership of each project ranging between 20% to 80% has been achieved. the attributable land area of these projects totals about 420,000 sq.ft.. if and when their ownerships are successfully consolidated, based on the government s latest city planning, the total estimated attributable gross floor area would be about 3,800,000 sq.ft. upon completion of redevelopment. based on the respective ownership currently secured for each project, the total pro-rata attributable gross floor area is about 1,800,000 sq.ft..
successful acquisitions for the above projects bear uncertainty. the group may not be able to consolidate ownerships of all projects.
redevelopments can only be implemented upon acquisition of the full ownership of the relevant projects.

underpinned by strong consumption sentiment and increasing inbound tourism, total retail sales of hong kong (both in terms of value and volume) increased by about 11% for the whole year of 2013. the group thus undertook targeted marketing activities, including organising shopping tours for mainlanders and wider adoption of multi-media promotional channels, to attract more customers to its shopping malls and boost tenants business. at the end of 2013, all of the group s major shopping malls, except those under renovation or re-alignment of tenant mix, recorded nearly full occupancy. there was significant increase in rents for most of the retail shops following rental reversion. renovation is in progress to further enhance the competitiveness of the group s various regional shopping malls (such as sunshine city plaza in ma on shan, metro city plaza ii in tseung kwan o, citimall in yuen long and city landmark i in tsuen wan) which have broad customer bases and offer easy access to mtr stations.

construction and property
in order to improve the cityscape and to provide better and safer living conditions for the community, the group has been active in acquiring old tenement buildings for urban redevelopment purposes. as most of these projects are located in populous districts, in order to expedite the construction process and minimise disruption to the neighbourhoods, leading features recommended by the leadership in energy and environmental design (leed) and beam plus have been adopted. for instance, in addition to the self-developed pre-fabricated building components, the group also procured advanced facilities to conduct foundation piling works for its development projects. against the prevailing increase in material costs and a shortage of construction workers, the above measures can help raise quality and cost efficiency by reducing construction waste and manpower.
in mainland china, the group s construction department takes charge of the key process of selecting main contractors and sub contractors, material sourcing and work tendering. they also closely monitor every project s cost effectiveness, work quality, construction safety and progress to ensure the same standard of excellence regarding building quality is achieved.

their unflagging efforts will be elaborated on in the sustainability and csr section of the annual report.

in 2013, the mainland property market showed an overall improvement in sentiment. although mainland china experienced a slow-down in economic growth in the first half of the year, an incessant end-user housing demand emerged, resulting from favourable government policies that encourage first time home ownership. the expectation of rising property prices also led to the continuous demand for housing with better quality. the macro economy of mainland china showed a steady rebound from august 2013. at the same time, there was a shift in government policy from administrative measures to market driven adjustment. local governments were also allowed the flexibility to devise measures commensurate with the particular market conditions.
therefore, the overall property market remained buoyant and bidding was brisk at land auctions.
during the year, much effort was made towards reorganisation, enhancing efficiencies and integrating resources for the group s development projects in mainland china. particular attention was paid to standardization of design layout and building materials, to expedite the development process and reduce development costs, which in turn raise the group s competitiveness and profit margin.

the group has always adhered to prudent financial management principles, as evidenced by its gearing ratio which stood at 17.2% at 31 december 2013 (2012: 17.2%).
in light of the low interest rate levels resulting from quantitative easing measures adopted by major economies around the world over the past few years, the group has concluded hong kong dollar interest rate swap contracts for terms ranging from three to fifteen years. such contracts were entered into for the purpose of converting part of the group s borrowings from floating interest rates into hong kong dollar fixed interest rates. it is considered that such a treasury management strategy will be of benefit to the group in the long run.

taking the helm in early 2014, the new chief of the federal reserve of the united states supported the tapering of the quantitative easing programme. at the same time, she reiterated that the federal funds rates would remain low for a considerable time unless there was a change in the economic outlook based on the labour market and general price level. the current low interest rate environment in hong kong should continue to underpin housing demand from as regards property sales , in addition to the aforesaid double cove starview , the group plans to embark on sales launches of double cove phase 3 and an array of urban residential developments this year. together with the unsold stocks, a total of over 3,800 residential units in hong kong will be available for sale the group has a land reserve in the new territories of about 42.5 million square feet, the largest holding among its peers in hong kong. as the earnest development of the new territories as well as introduction of a pilot scheme for arbitration on land premium were both issues committed to by the government in its policy address, land-use conversion may hopefully be expedited. besides, the group has been active in acquiring old tenement buildings in urban areas so as to expand its development land bank. many of these redevelopment projects have been put up for sale and will be completed successively. for the current year and over the next three years, nearly 7.0 million square feet in total attributable gross floor area is expected to be available for sale or leasing. details for these development projects are summarised in the above categories (1) to (6).
turning to mainland china, the third plenary session held late last year re-defined the policies on the mainland property sector, clearly focusing on the market mechanism and emphasizing comprehensive and deepening reforms in the long-term. the control measures for prime cities will continue to be strengthened, with the restrictions on home purchases, housing mortgage loans and other related measures unlikely to be withdrawn in the near future. however, there may be hopes of second and third tier cities seeing a gradual relaxation. it is anticipated that the overall economy of china will continue to grow and the demand from end- user home purchases will continue. the group will actively seek to expand its land bank in the mainland, targeting projects for first time home buyers and upgraders. apart from developing properties on its own, the group will continue looking for new joint-venture projects with local property developers.
in the group s hong kong land bank, properties under development accounted for 13.7 million square feet. inclusive of about 0.8 million square feet of major completed stock, the total attributable gross floor area amounted to approximately 14.5 million square feet. upon successive completion of these projects, assuming sale can be achieved at hk$10,000 per square foot, together with the completed stock, there would be an accumulative total sales value of hk$145 billion. these projects, about one half of which is located in the prime urban areas with relatively low costs, serve as an important pillar to support the group s revenue growth for the as regards rental business , the group held a total attributable gross floor area of over 10.0 million square feet in completed investment properties and hotels in hong kong. given the prevailing tight supply of office space, as well as the influx of inbound tourists to the shopping malls, continuous growth is expected in local rental income. mainland rental income also grew consecutively. the scheduled completion of henderson 688 in shanghai in 2014 will expand the group s mainland rental portfolio by about 0.7 million square feet to 7.3 million square feet in gross floor area. in 2013, the group s pre-tax net rental income continued to record a double-digit growth to hk$5,605 million.
with a continually expanding rental portfolio and an optimised tenant mix, the group s rental income is set to rise further, serving as another key stable income pillar of the group.
the group s associates , namely, hong kong and china gas, miramar and hong kong ferry, provide a solid basis for the group s sustainable growth in recurrent income. hong kong and china gas, in particular, makes the most significant profit contribution. inclusive of projects of its subsidiary, towngas china, this group currently has 173 projects on the mainland, spread across 22 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities. for its piped-gas business, it has a total of over 19.0 million gas customers in hong kong and mainland china. the sizeable customer base amid an expanding business coverage ensures a promising return from this group. together, they serve as another pillar to support the group s sustainable earnings growth.
the above three major income pillars, as well as a strong balance sheet with a low gearing, enable the group to create value for shareholders over the long haul. in the absence of unforeseen circumstances, the group s performance in the coming financial year will be satisfactory.
