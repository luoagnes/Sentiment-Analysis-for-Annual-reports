the groups grand lisboa palace project on cotai, which embodies our long-term confidence in macau and in china as well as our commitment to the solid diversification of our tourism business, made substantial progress in 2016, and we anticipate opening the resort in the first half of 2018. the grand lisboa palace will increase our hotel room capacity by almost five times and provide best-in-category shopping, dining, entertainment and events facilities that will enhance macaus position as a world centre of tourism and leisure.
also during 2016 we reopened the casino facilities at the jai alai building, and we anticipate opening the jai alai hotel soon, to complete our entertainment complex at oceanus at jai alai.
