during the year under review, the effect of financial crisis gradually subsided and confidence was restored. the us federal reserve decided to diminish the scale of its bond-buying programme and would also maintain low interest rates while the global economic conditions continued to improve.
the economic agenda for china in the coming years has been set by the new chinese leadership. in the course of undertaking a series of structural reforms, the economy maintained a slower paced but sustainable growth. the national gdp of china and guangdong grew by 7.4% and 7.5% respectively in the first half of 2014. the prc central government currently targets a gdp growth of over 7% for 2014 to maintain labour market stability. the national car sales volume maintained its growth momentum during the first half of 2014. according to the latest statistics, car sales increased by 8% to around 12 million vehicles during the first half of 2014. class 1 small car traffic in guangdong continued to increase, due to the healthy growth of passenger car sales. the group s expressways will benefit under the healthy economic backdrop.
the 89-km coastal expressway has been fully opened since 28 december 2013. an 18-km stretch of its guangzhou-dongguan section was toll-free since the full opening but resumed tolling starting from 1 august 2014. the group believes the diversion impact from the full opening of the coastal expressway on the gs superhighway has fully been realised and will continue to monitor the situation. at the same time, the group sees the gs superhighway will remain competitive as it offers convenient access to populous downtown areas and major expressways.
the western delta route is the most direct and convenient expressway artery in the regional expressway network that covers the most prosperous cities on the prd s western bank, including guangzhou, foshan, zhongshan and zhuhai. it offers convenient access to the hengqin state-level strategic new zone, macau and hong kong via its connection with the hzm bridge, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2016.
the group has a sound financial plan and enjoys a strong and solid financial position with net cash on hand amounted to rmb116 million as of 30 june 2014. the group has well-arranged financial resources for the funding requirements of west route jv, which are sufficiently funded by the group s net cash on hand, available committed undrawn banking facilities and stable cash dividends from gs superhighway jv. nevertheless, the group is currently exploring opportunities to lower the overall finance costs of its prc jv companies and will continue to strengthen its financial position.
mr. alan ming fai tam resigned as an executive director of the company with effect from 8 november 2013 due to his transfer to hopewell holdings limited, the holding company of the company, and he is now involved primarily in project management and construction cost control. i would like to take this opportunity to thank mr. alan ming fai tam for his valuable contribution to the company during his tenures of office.

i would like to take this opportunity to thank the group s managing director, my fellow directors, the management team and all staff members for their hard work, dedication and commitment during the past year. i would also like to thank all our shareholders, financiers and business partners for their continuous support and confidence in the group, which contributed greatly towards the group s success during the past year.
