the prospects for global growth have deteriorated markedly in the past several months, as escalation of the euro zone crisis has stalled global economic recovery and brought considerable uncertainties to the world markets. it is likely that resolution of the crisis will take time. until then, there will be considerable volatility in the markets that we operate in. therefore, even though the performance of our major profit contributing businesses has remained intact in recent months, we must remain vigilant and be ready to adjust our strategies accordingly.
despite the weaker global economic outlook, we remain cautiously optimistic on the prospects for our hotels in hong kong in 2012, in part because of the inflow of tourist arrivals from mainland china has so far shown little signs of slowing down. however, we are expecting the performance of our overseas hotels to be affected to varying degrees in 2012.
the contribution from champion reit should remain fairly stable in 2012. there might be some weakness in the income of citibank plaza because of softer demand in the central office market. that however should be compensated to a certain extent by the strength of the langham place mall, where positive rental reversions will lead to higher property income.
over the past several years, we have enhanced our financial resilience through aggressive reduction of debts. with a very low gearing position, we are on a strong footing to face the challenges of the forthcoming volatility in global markets.
