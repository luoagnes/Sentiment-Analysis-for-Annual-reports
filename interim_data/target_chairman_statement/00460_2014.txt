the success of these efforts was evident in a number of major breakthroughs in 2013. after receiving approval for clinical trials for category 1.1 new drug benapenem towards the end of 2012, we received approval for clinical trials for category 1.1 new drug imiglitin dihydrochloride and anaprazole sodium in february and july this year respectively. so far, sihuan pharmaceutical has obtained such approval for five category 1 innovative drugs. with regard to generic drug development, in addition to receiving production approval for our exclusive first-to-market generic drug roxatidine and category 3.1 new drug nalmefene, we have already filed applications for production approval for over 20 drugs, which are expect to be granted within several coming years. we expect to begin launching key patented innovative drugs from 2016 onwards, with four to five of them expected to reach the market between 2016 and 2020.
cooperation with international companies involving r&d of innovative drugs broke new ground. we have established cooperation with netherland s to-bbb technologies b.v. on the development of brain-target innovative drugs and commenced the r&d process. at the same time we are at the negotiation stage with other international companies. these measures will help ensure that sihuan pharmaceutical s r&d is aligned with international standards, and is ahead of its domestic peers.

all the sterile preparation production companies and facilities of sihuan pharmaceutical are certified under the new gmp standard. leveraging the opportunities from the chinese government s implementation of the new gmp standards in the country, we finished building our production and r&d system with a total gross floor area of over 300,000 square meters, which marks the largest-scale construction in our history.
as market competition intensified in 2013, we introduced flexibility in our sales and marketing by deploying different marketing strategies for our various core products. we stepped up academic promotion for promising products, and conducted clinical studies, which were recognized by the market, for our core products kelinao and oudimei, to reinforce their market leadership position and increase market penetration. meanwhile, our mature products maintained sound growth as we benefited from successful development into the low-end market.
