the group will maintain moderate scale expansion, consolidate current nationwide regional layout, and form the synergetic development layout of focusing on the west strait economic zone, and taking the first and second tier cities with great development potentials as regional centers.

prudently and properly expanding
as the current land reserve will be able to meet the needs for the next three to five years, the group will face the situation unexceptionally and will not acquire any land without any purpose.
apart from acquiring land parcel through public bidding, auction and listing, we will also increase our land reserve through primary and secondary collaboration development and acquisitions of companies. we will strictly observe the investment disciplines and pay greater attention on execution, sell-through rate and profit margin of project investments. it is envisaged that the west strait economic zone with xiamen as its centre will remain as the key region for our future development with the proportion in land reserves of no less than 50%. for areas outside the west strait economic zone that we have already had a foothold, we will also allocate resources appropriately to increase local land reserve at reasonable prices, continue to raise the level of our land reserve in shanghai, hefei and tianjin and put our existing brand advantages into full play, with an aim to solidify our presence in the region.
