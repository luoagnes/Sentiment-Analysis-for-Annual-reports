the sudden attacks on united states of america brought about adverse effects on the global economy in the short term. however, mainland china has until now been able to maintain its economic growth on a steady course. the hosting of olympic games 2008 in beijing will result in an abundant amount of work connected with construction of infrastructural projects to be undertaken and will contribute towards adding to the momentum of economic growth in mainland china. furthermore, mainland china's forthcoming accession to the world trade organisation will lead to further opening of its domestic markets and this will also enhance economic development in the country, with hong kong also becoming a beneficiary as more business and investment opportunities become available.

the various measures relating to housing and land policies promulgated by the government this year will all contribute towards stabilising local property prices. in this regard, the government's temporary halt on sale of home ownership scheme flats for a ten-month period and the declared reduction of the number of units to be put up for sale under the home ownership scheme in the next few years will not exceed 9,000 residential flats per year are of particular relevance. further, 12,000 home purchase loans will be offered by the government and all of such measures will lead to an increase in demand for property units developed by the private sector. at the same time, local housing mortgage loan rates have come down substantially following very keen competition to acquire home mortgage loan business by commercial banks and the ninetime consecutive reduction of local interest rates following the footsteps of the united states of america to reach close to a 40-year low level. the cost for maintaining a housing mortgage loan has now come down to a historic low level and the affordability of home purchasers is now enhanced as a result. also, rental incomes which may generate from the annual report 2001 henderson land development company limited
