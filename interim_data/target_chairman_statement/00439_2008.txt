chairman s statement review and future developments with uncertainty in sentiment of customers and adverse operating environment for manufacturing business, the group continued to encounter intensive competition during the year under review. although the group has proactively ceased all its major manufacturing operations in shenzhen and leased back the related premises, certain one-off costs have been incurred in the course of the cessation which negatively affected the group s as it is expected that the unfavourable economic and operating environment of the group will be continued, the group will reduce its reliance on manufacturing activities and explore other business opportunities to drive the group s long-term sustainable growth. during and after the year under review, the group has conducted several fund raising activities, which have effectively strengthened the financial position and broadened the capital base of the group. the group will also re-deploy its operations and assets as well as realise certain under-utilised assets to make funds available for other business developments and investments.

i would like to take this opportunity to deliver my most sincere gratitude to the board members and management team for their devoted commitments during the year.
on behalf of the group, i would also like to dedicate my special thanks to our bankers, investors, vendors and most importantly to our customers for their enduring trusts and supports.
with the commitments of all parties, we are on the mission in creating greater values to our shareholders, customers and employees in the future.
