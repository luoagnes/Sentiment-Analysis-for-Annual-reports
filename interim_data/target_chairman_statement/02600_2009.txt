chairman s statement i am pleased to present the annual report of the group for the year ended december 31, 2008 for shareholders review. on behalf of the board of the company and all employees, i would like to express my gratitude to all shareholders for their concern and support for the product market reviews the supply and demand as well as the price of aluminum are closely tied to changes in the global and prc macro- economy. changes in the global and prc economic climate have a significant impact on the aluminum primary aluminum market during the year 2008, the international and domestic prices of primary aluminum were volatile. prior to september, affected by various factors such as the u.s.
subprime crisis, economic slowdown in western countries as well as power restriction and production cuts of primary aluminum in countries such as the prc and south africa, the highest price of spot aluminum at the london metal exchange (hereafter as lme ) reached us$3,260 per tonne as compared to the lowest price of us$2,370 per tonne. the highest and the lowest prices of spot aluminum on the shanghai futures exchange (hereafter as shfe ) were rmb21,600 per tonne and rmb18,040 per tonne respectively. since october, the aluminum price experienced a consecutive sharp fall with the deepening and intensification of the international financial crisis. prices of spot aluminum on the lme and shfe hit a record low of us$1,471 per tonne and rmb10,050 per tonne, respectively. the average price of spot aluminum as quoted by lme in 2008 was us$2,573 per tonne, representing a decrease of 2.5% over the corresponding period last year, while that of shfe was rmb17,345 per tonne, representing a decrease of 11.4% over the corresponding period last year.
in 2008, the global output of primary aluminum was approximately 39.96 million tonnes, representing an increase of 4.7% over the corresponding period last year.
the global consumption of aluminum was approximately 38.13 million tonnes, representing an increase of 0.8% over the corresponding period last year. since 2008, especially in the fourth quarter when international financial crisis posed a deepening impact on entities economy, major aluminum consumption industries such as the real estate and automobile sectors have seen negative growth, followed by dampened global aluminum consumption and surge in stocks. in light of the sharp decline in aluminum prices and weakened consumption, both national and international aluminum manufacturers reduced production in succession. by the end of december 2008, the production capacity so reduced by global aluminum enterprises accounted for approximately 13.5% of the total production capacity around the world, while the reduction by prc enterprises accounted for approximately 24.1% of the total production capacity of the prc. in 2008, the domestic output of primary aluminum was approximately 13.18 million tonnes, representing an increase of 4.9% over the corresponding period last year and the domestic consumption of primary aluminum was approximately 12.50 million tonnes, representing an increase of 0.5% over the corresponding period last year.

in 2008, international and domestic prices of spot alumina retreated gradually. the cif prc price for spot alumina in the international market went up to a maximum of approximately us$450 per tonne, while the alumina price bottomed at approximately us$200 per tonne due to outpaced expansion in alumina production capacity, depleted production of aluminum manufacturers and drastic decrease in demand. the highest and lowest prices of domestic spot alumina were rmb4,500 per tonne and rmb1,850 tonne respectively. at present, the price is approximately rmb1,900 per tonne.
the global output of alumina for 2008 was approximately 79.18 million tonnes, representing a year-on-year increase of 6.2%; the consumption reached approximately 78.07 million tonnes, representing a year-on-year increase of 4.5%. in light of production cuts of aluminum, global alumina manufacturers have started to downsize production since the fourth quarter. by the end of december 2008, the production capacity of alumina so reduced by global and the domestic aluminum enterprises accounted for approximately 9.8% of the total global production capacity, while the reduction in the prc accounted for 24.4% of the total domestic production capacity. in 2008, the domestic output of alumina products reached approximately 22.78 million tonnes, representing a year-on-year increase of 17.1%. the demand for alumina was approximately 26.70 million tonnes, representing a year-on-year increase of 2.7%. in 2008, alumina imported into the prc amounted to approximately 4.58 million tonnes, representing a year-on-year decrease of 12.4%.

in 2008, the disasters including snow storm and earthquake in the prc caused substantial losses to the group, international financial crisis, raw material price hikes and sharply decreasing commodity prices further posed unprecedented difficulties and challenges to the group s production and operation. the group adopted effective countermeasures that were scientific, strengthened its management, reduced energy consumption, tapped potentials, increased efficiency, controlled costs and expenses, stabilized supply, strengthened sales and constrained investment to enable a stable operation of the group s production and business.
