during the year, slow recovery of the global economy, together with the european debt crisis and the quantitative easing policy of the u.s., have resulted in continuous volatility in the external market.
furthermore, inflation concerns have caused china to strengthen its austerity measures, which to a certain extent exerted pressure on the business operations of all industries. as market sentiment became conservative but operating costs remained high, during the year, the group operated in a cautious manner, with costs and risks under strict control, while the best efforts were made to ensure the development projects which were planned to be completed this year to commence production as scheduled.
both production capacity and sales hit records during the year, the group s production capacity scale and sales both hit records. pm29 and pm30 in taicang base commenced production at the end of 2010, bringing the group s total design production capacity to 9.52 million tpa. by the end of june this year, the group had another four new paper machines and three upgraded paper machines commenced production, namely pm3, pm27 and pm28 in dongguan, pm20 and pm21 in taicang, and pm31 and pm32 in tianjin. currently, the group s total design production capacity has reached 11.45 million tpa, nearly 24% of which being high-margin products including coated duplex board, food grade and pharmaceutical grade white board, coated linerboard and recycled printing and writing paper (uncoated woodfree paper, copy paper, etc.), representing a substantial increase as compared with around 11% in the last financial year, creating rooms for the group to elevate its profit in the group s sales for the year reached approximately rmb24.4 billion, representing a growth of approximately 36% as compared with the corresponding period last year and another record high. gross profit amounted to approximately rmb4.2 billion, representing a growth of approximately 8% as compared with the corresponding period last year. net profit attributable to equity holders amounted to approximately rmb1.97 billion, with basic earnings per share at approximately rmb0.42. the board has resolved to recommend the payment of a final dividend of rmb8 cents per share.
years of planning and implementation efforts reaching a peak in we believe the current environment of unfavourable market and tight liquidity is an inevitable stage in any economic cycle. notwithstanding the market volatility faced by the group during the year, with years of planning and accumulated resources in management, production and marketing, the group was able to maintain normal operations while expanding proactively. compared with other economic systems, china s strong economic foundation will enable it to sustain steady and long-term growth. furthermore, the prc government s 12th 5-year program will benefit those paper manufacturing enterprises which possess economies of scale and emphasize environmental protection. in the past few years, the group formulated its long-term strategic development plans according to the market situations, and invested billions of rmb every year to materialize these plans, so as to successfully capture valuable market development with the commencement of production of six new paper machines and three upgraded paper machines, 2011 is a landmark year for nd paper, in which it has reached its peak in development pace since its foundation. starting from 2012, the group will migrate to the next stage of steady growth. the group will further expand its business and raise its profitability return based on the local market supply and demand environment for each production base and the group s financial conditions.

after phase 1 construction is completed in the new paper manufacturing bases in quanzhou and shenyang, the group will have a complete network of production bases in china, and there is no more new production base development plan at this stage. in the future, the group will continue to position chongqing, shenyang and tianjin as the key markets for development, continuously strengthening the group s coverage in the markets in the bohai economic rim, mid-western regions of china and northeastern china.

outlook and acknowledgement although we maintain a bearish view on the current market and for the coming year, and the group will keep operating in a conservative and cautious manner, it is our conviction that successful capture of market opportunities and improvement in the areas such as sales, customer base, corporate operations, etc. have to be achieved by the expansion of economies of scale and continual optimization of its resources, and further fueled by improving market conditions and accelerating market consolidation. little efforts accumulate and help. in the future, the group can certainly leverage on its long-established advantages. as the most resourceful paper manufacturing enterprise in the prc, the group will, by employing its existing strengths in management and finance, make steady development in order to strive for better investment return for its shareholders in the foreseeable future. on behalf of all members of the board, i would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude to the management and all the staff for their dedication to and the trust they have bestowed on nd paper, as well as my appreciation for governments at all levels, investors, banks and business partners who have been supporting the group all along.
