during the year, although there was no notable recovery in the global economy, the chinese government s introduction of subsidies for energy-saving vehicles had mitigated the impact of depressed external economic performances on the domestic automobile industry. in addition, with the continued increase in domestic automobile manufacturers production capacity, the automobile industry as a whole witnessed a stable growth. according to the information of china association of automobile manufacturers, the production and sales volume of automobiles in china reached record highs again in 2012, which amounted to approximately 19,271,800 units and 19,306,400 units respectively, representing year-on-year increases of 4.6% and 4.33%. during the year, the automobile sales volume of the group reached 621,438 units, representing a year-on-year growth of 34.31%, which is much higher than the growth rate of the automobile industry. meanwhile, domestic automobile enterprises had accelerated international market development and had improvement in competitiveness, leading to rapid growth and remarkable results in automobile exports. the statistics of china association of automobile manufacturers showed that the total export volume of automobiles from china in 2012 amounted to 1,056,100 units, representing a year-on-year increase of 29.70%. during the year, the group also displayed satisfactory performance in overseas market sales. its export volume for the year reached 95,489 units, representing a year-on-year increase of 20.45%.
