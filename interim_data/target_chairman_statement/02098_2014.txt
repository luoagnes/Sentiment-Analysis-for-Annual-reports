the gdp of china for 2013 grew by 7.7% when compared with the year 2012 and exceeded rmb56 trillion, implying a stable growing trend amid complicated internal and external circumstances. the growth of household consumption of china slowed down mainly due to the challenging business environment as well as the soaring consumer prices and costs. it was a government policy to maintain the economic growth and to improve the living standards by expanding domestic demand through adjustment of the economic structure. in 2013, china government tried to boost domestic consumption through tax arrangements and industry policies with a view of making domestic consumption one of the major driving forces of the economy. the transactions of north hankou international trade center (the north hankou project ) hit a record high in the year 2013. north hankou project is the flagship project of the group and is the largest wholesale market in central china focusing on consumer products.
with the support of local and central government policies, the group further improved the logistics facilities and traffic connection of north hankou project to develop it into a trading hub of central china. construction of the extension of light rail no. 1 connecting north hankou project and the city centre of wuhan has commenced and is scheduled to be completed in 2014.

looking forward, it is expected that domestic commercial property market will further improve in 2014 in view of the steady growth in global economy and fiscal easing of china to boost consumption. the central government had reiterated that it will continue the urbanisation process and will boost domestic demand to drive the growth of consumption. under the policy support of 12th five year plan to promote the development of logistics industry, zall development will further benefit from the strong domestic demand in china. therefore, the group is confident that it will continue to grasp the opportunities to expand its business by cooperating with customers to create a win-win situation and achieve better results.
