in addition, the outburst of a fire in our qingdao operation in april 2003 and the re-introduction of an import ban by japan on poultry products from the prc from may to august 2003 have adversely affected the group s chicken meat export as japan is our primary market for export.
since december 2002, the costs of major raw materials required for feed production has increased significantly, and the situation was worsened due to the reduction in the overall production of grain throughout the prc in september and october 2003. the increase of costs in the fourth quarter of 2003 was more than 10% as compared to the same period in 2002. these adverse factors had complicated an already challenging operating environment. as a result, gross profit margin declined significantly.
