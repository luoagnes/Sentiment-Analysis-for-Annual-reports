the group s gross rental income, including contributions from joint-venture projects, increased by 18 per cent to hk$9,763 million.
net rental income increased by 21 per cent to hk$7,271 million.
overall rental income growth was driven by continuous positive rental reversions and increased contributions from projects including the fi rst phase of icc, the harbourview place and millennium city 6. the leasing market was slow for most of the year under review, but it has shown signs of stabilizing in recent months. the group s leasing strategy focused on maintaining occupancy in its rental portfolio, and it managed to achieve 93 per cent.

the residential markets on the mainland have recovered signifi cantly in terms of prices and volume since early this year. this came after a monetary easing and support measures for the property sector were introduced late last year. the mortgage credit tightening as to second homes in selected cities has yet to reverse the price uptrend, although transaction volumes showed some signs of moderating in major cities.
the group took advantage of the rising market by pre-selling projects in guangzhou and chengdu. sales of the guangzhou projects were encouraging as their outstanding quality was recognized in the market. the group has also established its brand in guangzhou, achieving premium pricing. the lake dragon project in a scenic resort area at huadu in guangzhou proved popular with buyers for its superior quality and design, and the fi rst batch of houses to go on the market sold quickly.

the hotel industry faced a challenging environment for most of the year. occupancy of the four seasons was affected as topquality hotels were hit by fewer business travellers since late 2008. other segments of the market were more resilient, though modestly affected by swine fl u in the past few months. the group s royal garden, royal plaza, royal park and royal view hotels maintained high average occupancy of 90 per cent during the year. the sophisticated w hong kong hotel at kowloon station has been operating smoothly since it opened in the third quarter of 2008.
in the longer term, hong kong will continue to benefi t from its status as a major fi nancial and business hub in asia, as well as a popular destination for leisure travellers. the group is developing new hotels in hong kong, including a luxury ritz-carlton at kowloon station that will be completed in 2010 and two hotels above the tseung kwan o mtr station.
telecommunications and information technology
intense price competition and the global economic slowdown resulted in a notable decline in profi t for smartone during the year. the company made further progress in expanding into the fi xed-line market by launching wireless fi xed broadband services for both home and business. smartone acquired additional spectrum in the 1800 mhz frequency band through an auction in june 2009 for future implementation of 4g lte on 1800 mhz. the company s compelling and differentiated service propositions, superior network performance and a strong fi nancial position enable it to meet customers total communications needs and explore new revenue streams. the group remains confi dent in the prospects for smartone and will continue to hold the company as a long-term strategic investment.

other infrastructure businesses businesses at both the river trade terminal and the air freight forwarding centre have been relatively resilient, despite the downturn in global trade. the wilson group also turned in a good performance. traffi c and revenue on the route 3 (country park section) remained steady. all the group s infrastructure projects are in hong kong and they constitute valuable investments for the the group s strong fi nancial position is demonstrated by its low gearing and high multiple of interest coverage. net debt to shareholders funds was a low 15.2 per cent as at 30 june 2009. this and over hk$10,000 million in cash from hong kong property sales to be received before the middle of 2010 will further strengthen the group s fi nancial position for long-term development.

the group values its staff as its most important asset. it continues to recruit top graduates from local and mainland universities, and it provides comprehensive training to staff at all levels to help them realize their potential. it also encourages staff to become involved in community service, and its volunteer team has been widely recognized for the much-needed help it provides to the global economic conditions are likely to improve in the times ahead, thanks to strong policy responses by various governments including massive fi scal spending and aggressive monetary easing. however, the pace and sustainability of the global economic recovery remain uncertain on the back of an unwillingness to spend on the part of consumers and businesses, as well as banks the mainland economy is expected to maintain a reasonable level of growth in the year ahead due to strong macro stimulus measures by the central government since the start of the year. ongoing economic integration between hong kong and the mainland, particularly the pearl river delta, should offer more business opportunities for hong kong companies. these and an environment of continued high liquidity and close-to-zero interest rates will bolster hong kong s economy.
it is expected that hong kong s residential market will remain resilient with its strong underlying fundamentals, despite challenging external and domestic economic conditions. affordability for homebuyers is relatively strong by historical standards and mortgage interest rates are at a historic low and attractive relative to rental yields. an increase in purchases by mainlanders is also supporting the demand for residential property in hong kong. these factors coupled with low levels of new residential supply in the coming years mean promising prospects for the market.
the group will continue to strengthen its property development business in hong kong by adding new residential sites to its land bank through various means, particularly the conversion of agricultural land to residential sites. the group will enhance its competitiveness and leading position by meeting homebuyers needs with high-quality products that feature modern designs, effi cient layouts and comprehensive facilities, as well as premium service.
the demand for commercial properties including offi ce and retail space for lease is expected to remain relatively slow, given the uncertain macro-economic outlook. the group will focus on maintaining high occupancy in its rental portfolio in the current environment. it will continue refurbishing its shopping malls and offi ce buildings regularly to meet the rising expectations of tenants and stay ahead of the market. more promotions will be staged to attract additional traffi c fl ow and consumer spending in the group s malls. in the long term, the group will continue reviewing and optimizing its rental portfolio.
the group will maintain a selective and focused investment strategy for mainland business. major cities including beijing, shanghai, guangzhou and shenzhen are the preferred choices. with promising prospects for the mainland economy and property markets, the group will continue looking for good investment opportunities. with the completion of shanghai ifc and continued sales of residential projects, earnings from the mainland businesses are expected to rise over time.
major residential projects in hong kong to go on sale in the next nine months include aria in kowloon, ap lei chau inland lot 129 in island south, tuen mun town lot 465 and park island phase 6 on ma wan. barring unforeseen circumstances, the results for the coming fi nancial year are expected to be satisfactory.
