we continue to remain optimistic and challenged by our future prospects. whilst we see many opportunities to grow returns to unitholders, we will also seek to ensure that our portfolio will continue to contribute to the daily lives of many hong kong people by providing them with improved shopping facilities. i am confident that our strong professional management team can take these opportunities and create value for our unitholders, shoppers, tenants and the community of hong kong.
