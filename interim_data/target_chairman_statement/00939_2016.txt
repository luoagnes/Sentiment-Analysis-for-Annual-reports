chairman and executive director in 2015, the global economy experienced a difficult year of recovery with growing divergences, and china faced the growing pressure of economic downturn. in the face of such an extraordinarily complex operating environment and fierce market competitions, the group accelerated transformation towards a bank featuring integration, multifunctional service, intensive development, innovation and smartness, arduously served the real economy, and strengthened comprehensive risk management. a solid growth has been achieved with a good balance of scale, quality and profitability, with the core indicators and market capitalisation of the group maintaining a leading position among peers.
