the decrease in underlying profit is attributable to a net reduction in non-recurring profits, in particular the disposal of the group s hong kong port interests in 2005. core property and aviation earnings grew strongly in the year.

following the disposal in 2005 of the company s interest in modern terminals, it agreed to sell its minority interest in shekou container terminals realising a profit of hk$?.0 billion. this will be recognised in the earnings from the trading & industrial division fell by ?5% in 2006. weakness in consumer demand in taiwan reduced sales in the company s automotive trading business and sharply increased aluminium prices reduced margins at the company s canning plants in swire pacific s governance principles and the processes adopted to safeguard the interests of shareholders are set out on pages 54 to 66.
