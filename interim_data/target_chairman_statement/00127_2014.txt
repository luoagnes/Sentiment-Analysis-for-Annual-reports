although at rather slow paces, the signs of recovery for both the united states and european economies are enhancing. low interest rate environments are likely to continue, helping to ensure that these economies will continue on their recovery paths. the economic growth for mainland china is also healthily maintained, and its structure is on her track to a more sustainable growth in mid to long term. as a result, after a few years of turbulence, it is hopeful that a more stable global economic environment will be seen this year.
the group s retail investment properties continued to perform well during the year. with continued increases in mainland visitors and local consumption, our prime shopping malls like the one, silvercord and windsor house have all recorded satisfactory rental growth at 11.56%, 11.09% and 8.73% respectively for the year. we will continue to enhance the attractiveness for our shopping malls to boost customer flow and spending by introducing new elements, providing cozy shopping environment and securing the optimal tenant mix.
the office investment properties of the group continued to lease well during the year. the overall occupancy rate of our commercial premises, including massmutual tower, harcourt house and windsor house had been well upheld, remaining high at 97.18% throughout the year. amidst improving business environments, we are confident in seeing growing rental income in these quality commercial premises in the coming years.
for the residential property market, the implementations of various stamp duties have not only dampened the sales volume and selling prices of the residential properties but also affected its demand in a short run. it is expected that the residential property market in hong kong will continue to face challenges in the foreseeable future and influenced by the cooling measures, particularly in sub-urban areas and new towns, where there are abundant future supply. on the other hand, well located properties, such as those on the hong kong island, are well sheltered by limited supply.
the group is very confident therefore, that our sumptuousness residential projects situated in prestigious locations like one wanchai, no.1 south lane, no. 12 shiu fai terrace and no. 55 conduit road will continue to be hot sellers.

during the year, the central government was keen in establishing an effective and long-term mechanism to maintain the stability of macro- control measures for the steady development of the property markets in mainland china. a market based mechanism will follow in future, as the reforms for land, fiscal and tax are implemented; and as the policy for housing supply system are executed by the central government. the group believes that the mid to long-term property policies in mainland china are becoming clear, which will be helpful for the country s macro- economy and property markets to grow in a more healthy manner.
the group achieved good sales performance for the metropolis and splendid city, which are located in chengdu, a core city in the western china. in particular, splendid city is nearly fully sold out. given the prime locations and superb quality, the group believes that the metropolis and the ready-for-launch mixed use development, chinese estates plaza, will continue gaining market recognition and be well sought after; and that the sales of these projects will perform well in 2014.
looking forward, the group will continue to manage its businesses in a prudent manner and will strive for developing recurrent income streams so as to provide long-term sustainable growth for the benefit of the group and its shareholders as a whole.

i would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the shareholders for their continuing support. i would also like to express my sincere thanks to my fellow directors and all staff members for their dedication and hard work.
