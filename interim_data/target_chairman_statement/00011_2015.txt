the global economy grew at a modest pace in 2014. underpinned by stronger domestic demand, improved gdp growth in the us offset relatively slower growth in the eurozone. in japan, an increase in the valueadded tax rate dampened domestic demand during the second half of the year.
hong kong s economy expanded by 2.4% during the first three quarters of the year, supported by buoyant labour market conditions and improvement in the balance of trade. stronger us demand and the continuing health of the domestic balance sheet should enable the city to withstand economic headwinds and remain on a growth track. we forecast real gdp growth of 2.6% for 2015 a modest increase on the 2.2% we expect for 2014.
in mainland china, the property market correction and the overhang of surplus capacity have led to a slowdown in economic expansion. gdp growth for 2014 was 7.4%, compared with 7.7% in 2013. economic challenges will persist in 2015, but resilient domestic consumption and government efforts to stimulate economic activity will provide support for growth. we expect gdp growth to be lower in 2015 compared with 2014, but still above 7.0%.
in a challenging economic environment, hang seng maintained good growth momentum in 2014. capitalising on our strong market position and brand, we leveraged our competitive strength to improve efficiency and provide an enhanced service experience for customers.
