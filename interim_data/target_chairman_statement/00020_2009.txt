the wharf (holdings) limited building for tomorrow is wharf s mission. harbour city and times square, the heart of the group representing 46% of its total assets and 63% of total operating profit, posted solid double-digit growth in both turnover and operating profit, despite the adverse economic conditions. this was the tomorrow that wharf has built for today.
in the meantime, wharf is building a new tomorrow in the mainland. as at the end of 2008, its attributable landbank and investment properties totalled close to 100 million square feet of gross floor times squares in beijing, shanghai and chongqing are investment properties and together reported rises in revenue and operating profit of 22% and 38% in 2008 over 2007, respectively. in addition, the 180,000-square-foot shopping mall in dalian times square opened in november 2008 and quickly became the luxury shopping landmark of the northeast.
wharf s next flagship, the international finance centre (ifc) project in hongxing road, chengdu, is comparable in significance to harbour city and times square in hong kong. chengdu is the up and coming business hub at the heart of western china and has a population of 11 million, trailing only beijing, shanghai and chongqing. prime retail rental is comparable to that in shanghai. sitting at the top location in the city s main commercial district, the project links to the adjacent mass transit railway station where two major lines intersect. there are three leading department stores across the street.
the scale of the development, also with retail, office, apartments and hotel, is comparable to that of harbour city. it aims to quickly become the best of the west as the new shopping hub for not only chengdu but the entire western region when it is completed in phases from 2012.
in development properties, wharf has been achieving record or near record sales for its various residential projects in the respective cities. recent pre-sales launches in cities such as chengdu, chongqing and dalian have met with very favourable response.
the group remains enthusiastic about the fundamental outlook for the real estate market in the mainland. urbanisation is the theme for the next 20 years. close to 300 million people are anticipated to be moving into the cities. our overall development portfolio is expected to generate attractive returns to the group in the coming years.

given the sheer scale of the global financial meltdown, economies across the globe have deteriorated sharply since the latter part of 2008. hong kong economic performance in 2009 is bound to be affected. gdp is expected to contract by 2% to 3%. worsening economic conditions will put a further drag on the key sectors of hong kong. however, it is believed that china will be the first country to recover from the global crisis and will be able to ride out the challenges of a worsening global crisis.
its sustained economic growth as well as massive support measures to hong kong will be able to help hong kong weather the financial storm. the mainland government has pledged to further strengthen the economic and financial co-operation between hong kong and the pearl river delta region and to further facilitate mainland visitors to hong kong. as an international financial centre and a leading hub for china-related business, hong kong will strive to maintain its roles and to lessen the impact from the deteriorating economic conditions. medium-term prospects for hong kong remained positive.
the group is well-poised for creating a better future and displaying its vibrancy on the back of numerous investment opportunities in hong kong and china. on its new projects underway in china, the group is confident they will achieve a reasonable profit to the group in the next few years. the group will carefully plan the progress of development through close monitoring of market conditions.
the projects involved will be funded both by equity and debt, as well as proceeds from operations and on behalf of shareholders and my fellow directors, i wish to express our heartfelt gratitude to all staff for their dedication and contribution throughout the financial year.
