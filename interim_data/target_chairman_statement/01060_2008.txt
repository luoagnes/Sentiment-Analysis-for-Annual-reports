cement consumption in shanghai reached its peak in 2006 and 2007 saw decreasing demand for cement in the industry. the austerity measures taken in shanghai were much stricter than in other provinces and have adversely affected shanghai s economic development. the increase in the price of coal has led to an increase in the unit cost of production and without a corresponding increase in the cement price, the profit margin of the cement manufacturers will continue to be affected. nevertheless, it is hoped that the reconstruction activities after the catastrophe resulting from the recent severe weather conditions and the anticipated demand from events such as shanghai world exposition, beijing-shanghai railway and shanghai hongqiao transportation hub will lead to greater cement consumption and help to mitigate the situation.
being one of the cement companies selected by the ministry of land and resources and the people s bank of china to be under the auspices of the state, the group has devoted its resources to enhancing internal control and technology development to improve its competitiveness.
global demand for gold has increased substantially since early 2006. it is expected that the gold market in china, the third largest gold consumer in the world, will follow such a trend. further, the gold market in china has been gradually deregulated in recent years and the chinese government has established a series of policies to promote the development of the gold industry to encourage gold mining enterprises to use advanced technologies in mining and production by granting them preferential treatment on taxation. these developments have significantly improved the business environment of the gold mining industry in china.
the group believes that the acquisition of redstone presents a good opportunity to develop our investment and business in the natural resources sector, and enable the group to increase earnings and enhance value for shareholders by diversifying into the potentially profitable gold mining business in china.
