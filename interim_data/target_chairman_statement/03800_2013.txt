outstanding results of overseas solar power plants business the solar power investment team of gcl-poly achieved good results in 2012. on 25 july 2012, gcl solar energy. inc, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, closed the sale of a 92 mw solar power plant project in the united states to consolidated edison development, inc., a power company located on the east coast of the united states, with total revenue of us$286 million and expected profit before tax of us$16 million. on 15 november 2012, the company successfully sold two solar power plant projects in the united states with a total capacity of 48 mw and recorded total revenues of us$46 million. these two disposals demonstrated our execution capability in the development, construction and financing for large scale solar farms.
in china, gcl-poly signed a cooperation framework agreement with china merchants new energy in 2012 to develop solar farm projects, pursuant to which both parties will jointly develop solar farms with an installed capacity of approximately 1 gw within the next three years. as at the end of august 2012, the company obtained the approval from the national energy administration for the construction of a 310 mw ground solar power plant and a 30 mw rooftop solar power plant in datong city, shanxi province and the preliminary works have been commenced. upon completion, this project will become the largest solar farm in china and one of the largest standalone solar farms in the world. at the same time, the company has established successful cooperation with several well-known international banks and financial institutions such as wells fargo, bank of america merrill lynch, standard chartered bank and china development bank. all of them will provide strong financing support to gcl-poly on its solar farm projects, which lays a solid foundation for gcl-poly to expand its investment in solar farms in the united states and the other oversea regions.
for system integration, on 10 december 2012, the company announced that it would arrange the solar module procurement for two 75 mw solar power plant projects which are currently the largest in south africa. all the solar modules used in these projects are made from gcl-poly s quality wafers. the company signed the 20-year power purchase agreements for both projects with eskom, a power company in south africa. this transaction not only expanded sales channels for our wafers, but also proved our capability in providing solar system integration solutions for the international market. to strengthen our leadership in the solar industry, we continue to implement our dual-core strategy in both the upstream and downstream businesses. in the upstream market, we manufacture high quality polysilicon and wafers; while at downstream, we develop solar power plants and provide system integration services.

stable power business development outperforms peers in 2012, the power business continued to record stable development. the company has continued to maximize the efficiencies of existing resources by means of centralized management, cost cutting measures and exploring new opportunities to ensure the sound and stable development of its power and steam businesses. as at the end of 2012, the company sold 5,370,397 mwh of electricity, with a year-on-year increase of 12.0%, and 8,501,198 tonnes of steam, with a year-on-year rise of 12.4%. while ensuring stable growth of the business, the company also adopted various measures including coal purchasing cost controls, bulk purchasing of resources, expansion of steam supply, and vigorous efforts in steam-price adjustment. the financial results for the electricity business in 2012 showed our clear advantage when compared with the industry peers.
while devoting all our effort to the solar business development, we will ensure our environmentally friendly power business development remain healthy and stable. on one hand, we will adopt proactive measures to cope with fluctuations in fuel prices and ensure effective development of the power business. on the other hand, we will further optimize our business mix in accordance with carbon neutral principles by increasing our investments in clean and renewable energy, and raising the proportion of power plants biomass and gas power generation.
social responsibilities and honors as a global leading enterprise that has long been engaged in the development of renewable energy, gcl-poly is well aware of its responsibilities to environmental protection and social contribution. while ensuring our manufacturing activities to be in compliance with national environmental standards, we also actively participated in various public welfare activities and gained positive feedbacks from the society. on 22 february 2012, gcl-poly energy holdings limited was honored as the model charity unit in suzhou (]haujuqumo) by the municipal government of suzhou. in march 2012, our company was recognized as china s creditability enterprises , was the only power company received such accolade. in june 2012, gcl poly was awarded 2012 best brand image enterprise during the china s financial summit; in november 2012, the company was chosen to be the top 100 listed companies in hong kong. during the same month, the company chairman also received the 2nd golden bauhinia most influential leader award . in 2013, we will continue to use our best effort to actively serve the society by creating jobs, making charitable donations and taking an active role in public welfare.

as a result of technological innovation, economy of scale of polysilicon production, as well as solar cell technology improvements in china, lower costs of solar power generation is achieved, thus providing a favorable position for china to develop domestic pv market in a meaningful scale. china is set to become one of the world s largest country for renewable at the same time, in the face of increasing global environmental issues and the depletion of fossil-based energy resources, various governments also put focus on the development and usage of new energy, such as photovoltaic solar energy and other clean energies, have become the future energy strategy development focus. the negative impact to the solar industry development resulted from the current international trade protection and barriers, as well as the existing supply and demand imbalance, is only a temporary phenomenon. with the rapid rise of emerging markets such as japan, latin america, south africa, asean countries and the middle east, we have full confidence in the future prospects of the solar industry.
with reduction in production costs along the entire pv value chain, higher product conversion efficiency rates and the growth of emerging markets, we believe that there will be substantial growth of demand in the pv industry. in the first quarter of 2013, the market price of polysilicon increased from the lowest of us$15 per kilogram to us$18 per kilogram. the prices of wafers, cells and modules for the downstream industry steadily increase. as market demand slowly grows, the capacity utilization in the various segments of the industry has increased, as compared to the fourth quarter of the previous year.
this year, we will continue to increase our emphasis on technological enhancements this year, such that we could lower our polysilicon and wafer manufacturing cost to improve our profitability and cash flow. meanwhile, we are making great progress with modifying our power sources for polysilicon manufacturing projects in xuzhou. the final confirmation of power sources for polysilicon manufacturing projects will eventually bring positive impacts to our profitability and polysilicon manufacturing cost structure significantly, and further expand our global cost leadership in polysilicon manufacturing. in order to improve the company fundamentals of long-term investments, we will also actively seek the use of low-cost long-term financing products to strengthen our capital structure and solidify our operations.
finally, i would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to our directors, management team and all the staff members of gcl- poly for their efforts and hard work over the past year. i also wish to extend my gratitude to our shareholders and business partners for their continuing support.
