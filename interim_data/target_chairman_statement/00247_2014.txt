prospects the u.s. economy has continued to improve with lower unemployment rate.

overall financial conditions in euro zone have stabilised, but economies remain vulnerable with high unemployment, excess production capacity and deflationary pressure in a number of its member countries. in response to the situation, european central bank has lowered interest rates, imposed negative rates on overnight deposits from banks for the first time and provided banks with new long-term funds. it has also started the lending programme of targeted long term refinancing operations alongside with other stimulus measures to increase bank lending and to drive economic growth in the years china s economy has been growing steadily. economic, financial and social reforms covering a wide range of areas will lead the economy and society towards a more healthy and sustainable development. as the economic growth in the u.s. continues to strengthen, exports from china should continue to pick up. combined with the economic forces of domestic consumption-led growth, the gain in momentum in china s economy will have a positive effect on the hong kong economy which in turn is supportive to a better business environment for hong kong. economic growth in hong kong has been stable with low unemployment and a healthy and prudent the hong kong property market has been going through a period of change as a result of economic and property-related policies. in february 2014, legislative council passed the stamp duty (amendments) ordinance 2014 in relation to the implementation of buyer s stamp duty and special stamp duty. an amendment to the double stamp duty passed in july 2014 has helped to improve buying sentiment as more projects were launched to market for sale. primary transaction volume has recently recovered, but with rising construction costs and the property-related policies, there remain sensitivities in the hong kong property market. management will closely monitor the situation and will be responsive to market changes. sino land s recurrent businesses, which comprise property leasing, hospitality and property management services, continue to be resilient. with a good financial position, sino land is well-positioned to respond to challenges ahead.
