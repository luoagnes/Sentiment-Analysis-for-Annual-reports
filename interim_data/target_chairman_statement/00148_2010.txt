chairman s statement it gives me great pleasure to report to the shareholders that kingboard chemical holdings limited ( the group ) delivered solid financial performance for the financial year ended 31 december 2009. despite a tough start in the first quarter of 2009, the group saw impressive operational improvement in three core businesses from the second quarter of 2009 due to massive stimulus packages implemented by governments worldwide. the group continued to gain growth momentum in china as a result of our strategic focus on expanding the domestic china market, which was less affected by the global economic downturn.
export demand for consumer products progressively improved in the second half of 2009 ( 2h 2009 ) and domestic china market delivered sustained growth against the previous year.
the group s laminate business continues to maintain its number one position in the global laminate market and the printed circuit board ( pcb ) division is the largest pcb manufacturer in china. both divisions were able to leverage on their unrivaled market position to advance market share and made significant contributions to group s earnings. underpinned by rebound in construction and industrial activities in china, chemical division s performance turned around sharply in 2h 2009 with higher revenue and profit. as a result, both group revenue and profit grew substantially in 2h 2009 against the first half of 2009 ( 1h 2009 ). group revenue for the full year was 0.4% higher than the previous year at hk$23,772.5 million while underlying net profit (excluding non-recurring items) increased 6% to hk$2,239.0 million. underscoring the group s strategy of building a balanced business portfolio, these excellent achievements empowered the group to ride out of the financial crisis with outstanding with over 60 manufacturing plants most of them located in china and sales offices stretching over 3 continents, the group has established a strong foothold in the past 20 years with total asset value over hk$43.4 billion. with our experienced and dedicated management team, excellent business model with robust financial position, the group is in an advantageous position to seize business opportunities and deliver attractive returns to our shareholders in future.

with better than expected export demand and a thriving domestic china market, laminate business volume surged 30% in 2h 2009 against that in 1h 2009 with improved capacity utilization. domestic consumption was effectively stimulated by the implementation of home appliances to the country side subsidy programme by prc government which in turn boosted demand for paper laminates. china was our single largest geographic market with domestic sales denominated in renminbi ( rmb ) reaching approximately 40% of the group laminates sales in 2009. average selling price ( asp ) of laminate products was lower than the previous year. as a result, revenue (including inter-segment sales) for the laminate division declined 10% to hk$9,420.6 million. volume sales increased around 4% with average monthly shipment reaching 8.1 million square meters.
earnings before interest and tax ( ebit ) increased substantially by 28% against 2008 to hk$1,955.8 million.
similar to the laminate division, utilization rates for the group s pcb plants improved to over 90% since q3 2009. due to lower asp of pcb products against the previous year, pcb division s revenue declined 8% to hk$7,236.6 million. ebit increased by 3% to hk$607.2 million. ebit margin improved to 8.4%.
the strategic move to invest in two dedicated high density interconnect pcb ( hdi ) plants in kaiping, guangdong province and kunshan, jiangsu province proved to be a successful one.
hdi sales increased by over 3 times against the previous year and contributed positively to the pcb division earnings. our acquisition strategy continued to work well. the two pcb shops named express at suzhou and dongguan acquired by the group in february 2008 and march 2009 respectively integrated well with the group. these two pcb plants contributed positively to the division s earnings in the current year.
with strong demand for chemical products in 2h 2009, most of the group s chemical plants operated near full capacity and achieved higher asp. in order to secure stable feedstock supply for huizhou phenolacetone plant and further strengthen our vertically integrated business model, the group strategically increased its stake in the chemical refinery plant in yangzhou, jiangsu province from 25% to 76% at the end of september 2009. shortly after the take-over by the group, the plant started to generate positive contributions to the chemical division earnings in the last quarter of 2009. in addition, hebei acetic acid plant commenced trial production in september 2009 and continued to ramp up throughout q4 2009. back by additional output from these two projects, revenue (including inter-segment sales) for chemical division increased 24% to hk$9,490.1 million. consequent to lower chemical asp in 1h 2009 and lower capacity utilization at the initial startup at hebei acetic acid plant in q4 2009, ebit of the chemical division reduced 11% to hk$590.9 million. share of associates results (bulk of which contributed by our natural gas based methanol joint venture with china bluechemical limited) was down 83% to hk$64.3 million for 2009 mainly due to lower methanol asp against last year.
liquidity and capital resources our financial and liquidity position continued to be strong. as at 31 december 2009, net current assets and current ratio of the group were approximately hk$9,520.2 million (31 december 2008 hk$5,264.4 million) and 2.05 (31 december 2008 1.72) the net working capital cycle lengthened from 65 days as at 31 december 2008 to 81 days as at 31 december 2009 on the following key metrics: inventories, in terms of stock turnover days, increased to 67 days (31 december 2008 48 days) as the group stocked up key raw materials strategically in anticipation of rising commodity prices.
trade receivables, in terms of debtors turnover days, increased to 68 days (31 december 2008 61 days).
trade and bills payables, in terms of creditors turnover days, increased to 54 days (31 december 2008 44 the group s net gearing ratio (ratio of interest bearing borrowings net of cash and cash equivalents to total equity) was approximately 22% (31 december 2008: 23%). the proportion of bank borrowings between short term and long term stood at 30%: 70% (31 december 2008: 27%: 73%). about 10% of the bank borrowings was denominated in rmb and the rest in hong kong or us dollars. in 2009, the group invested around hk$2.6 billion in new production capacities. as at 31 december 2009, the group had approximately hk$1.98 billion properties held for development. as the group set up over 60 manufacturing sites at various provinces in china in the past 20 years with good reputation, the group has been invited recently by local provincial authorities to participate in certain urban redevelopment projects.
with strong cash inflow generated from our core businesses together with our dedicated and experienced management team, the group is confident that these projects will generate stable and attractive return to our shareholders in future.
the group continued to adopt prudent financial management policy including the use of interest rate swap contract to minimize exposure to fluctuation in interest rates movement. at the end of 2009, we had entered into interest rate swap agreements of notional amount of hk$4.3 billion with reputable financial institutions for a weighed average duration and interest rate of 1.18 years and 2.99% respectively. we also entered into commodity forward contracts to manage the group s exposure to fluctuation in commodity prices. the fair value of these contracts amounted to hk$11.6 million as at 31 december 2009. other than derivative financial instruments in connection with our daily operations as mentioned above, the group had not entered into any other type of derivative financial instruments throughout 2009. there was no material foreign exchange exposure to the group during the year under review. the group s revenue, mostly denominated in hong kong dollars, rmb and us dollars, was fairly matched with the currency requirement of operating as at 31 december 2009, the group had a global workforce of over 45,400 (31 december 2008: 40,800). the increase in headcount was in line with improved business volume against last year. in addition to offering competitive salary package, the group grants share options and discretionary bonuses to eligible employees based on our overall financial achievement and their laminate order bookings in the first two months of 2010 reflected continuous improvement against q4 2009 with an uptrend of asp against the previous quarter. looking ahead, the chinese government will continue to implement the subsidy policy of household appliances and automobile purchases in 2010. these measures will definitely have a positive impact on domestic consumption of electronic products which will translate into thriving demand for laminates. to capture buoyant growth in china domestic market and the recovering export market, the group will scale up laminate production capacities by about 15% in 2010. monthly capacity of paper laminates will expand by 400,000 sheets in 1h 2010, while monthly capacity of glass epoxy laminates and paper laminates will be raised by 400,000 sheets each in jiangyin, jiangsu province in 2h 2010.
these additional capacities will enable us to achieve further market share gain in the global laminate market. to promote economic growth and achieve sustainable urban development, the chinese government has initiated a new pilot scheme for the redevelopment of three olds old towns, old villages and old factory buildings in guangdong province. the group has been in active discussions with local authorities in shenzhen to explore the feasibility of redeveloping our plant in longhua, shenzhen.
pcb division also enjoyed good order intake momentum since the beginning of 2010 and most of our pcb plants were operating at full capacity in the first two months of 2010.
improving consumer confidence is expected to push demand growth for electronic products in most end market segments in 2010. pcb division will continue to enhance its product mix and technical capabilities especially on hdi business so as to meet customer requirements for quality products at competitive costs. in addition to organic capacity growth of approximately 15% planned in 2010, the group will actively seek potential co- operation possibilities with other pcb shops in the market.
massive government stimulus and infrastructure plans boosting economic growth and domestic consumption are expected to continue in china in 2010 which in turn will stimulate the demand for key chemical products including coke, methanol, phenol and acetone. additional contribution from the yangzhou chemical refinery plant and the hebei acetic acid plant will definitely be the key growth drivers for chemical division in 2010. furthermore, huizhou phenolacetone plant delivered attractive returns for the group in 2009 due to strong demand for these specialty chemical products in china. modification plans are currently underway to improve the production efficiency of the huizhou plant with the aim to reduce energy consumption and emission by the end of 2010.

finally, on behalf of the board, i would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to our shareholders, customers, banks, the management and employees for their unreserved support to the group in the past year.
