during the 12th five-year plan period, the growth in pharmaceutical industry in china had gradually slowed down from high to moderate and has entered into a new norm. however, the group has seen the existence of both opportunities and challenges. as a leading pharmaceutical enterprise in china, the group has adapted to the healthcare reform by innovation and transformation. business focus has been concentrated on developing high value-added new drugs, actively responding to market changes, exploring new businesses in the market and internationalisation of products and brand, with remarkable results achieved.
as we entered the 13th five-year plan period, the healthcare reform in china further deepened in 2016 with numerous policies introduced, involving drug manufacturing, drug distribution, quality supervision, drug usage and health insurance. healthcare reform policies related to product quality bioequivalence evaluation and manufacture practice inspection are expected to gradually shift pharmaceutical production to large enterprises. implementation of the two-invoice system, the change from business tax to value-added tax and the new gsp are expected to reshuffle the pharmaceutical distribution industry. stringent usage restriction on antibiotic and inspection of product adverse reaction are expected to facilitate structural changes on end-users drug usage. moreover, the slow approval process for new drugs, policy tightening, tender price pressure and drug price negotiation have created a direct impact on the pharmaceutical industry. under this challenging environment, pharmaceutical companies need to keep on seeking new business developments and growth drivers.
with the accelerating aging population, progress of urbanisation policy and increase in the peoples income level in china, the demand for pharmaceutical products in china is expected to have a continuous increase. on top of that, factors such as deteriorating environmental pollution and unhealthy dietary habits have led to an increasing number of new cancer cases in china, with current number standing at about 3.5 million each year. as a result, the demand for effective treatment is growing year by year. in addition, the recent government policies on major innovative drugs have facilitated the development and market expansion of cancer drugs. with increasing concern for major and serious diseases, local provinces have also included more drugs for major and serious diseases in the medical reimbursement scope and supported the clinical use of domestic drugs in order to alleviate the burden of patients.
driven by these favorable factors, we expect the oncology drugs market in china will continue to maintain rapid growth in the future. meanwhile, the increasing incidence of other senile diseases (such as cardio-cerebrovascular disease, senile dementia, diabetes, etc.) is also leading to a greater demand for medical treatment.
in view of the massive size of population with the four major diseases mentioned above, the groups nbp, oulaining, xuanning, duomeisu, jinyouli, linmeixin (glimepiride dispersible tablets) have huge market potential. on the other hand, the group will also actively adapt to the policy direction towards tiered medical system and allocating more medical resources to the basic-tier market. the group will make adjustments to its market strategy and step up the development of the basic-tier end-user market. with the revision of the national reimbursement drug list this year, the group has 8 products newly included in the new national reimbursement drug list which will provide promising prospect on market expansion in the future.
