the group s materials business achieved a profit contribution of hk$127 million in 2008. this represents an 11 per cent decrease as compared to last year due to high fuel prices and rising freight charges.
with a number of new major infrastructure projects being announced by the government of the hong kong special administrative region, demand for cement, concrete and aggregates is expected to increase in the near term. as the impact of fuel prices and freight charges declines, a more promising outlook for the group s materials business is anticipated.

financial management and treasury

the global financial crisis has touched almost all markets and industries in the world and the group has felt its effects as well. a loss arising on treasury activities was recorded by the group in 2008. a significant proportion of this loss resulted from a sizeable currency fluctuation of hk$631 million, which was mostly comprised of unrealised mark-to-market adjustments arising from a 30-year yen borrowing and other foreign currency deposits. these fair value changes have no immediate cashflow impact on cki.

subsequent event divestment of three power plants in mainland china in february 2009, cki announced the divestment of three power plants in mainland china to hk electric which, subject to completion, will generate a one-off gain of approximately hk$1,348 million to be booked in the first half of 2009.

through the divestment of the three power plants, cki will realise the value of some of the mature projects in its portfolio. it will also further enhance the group s capacity to take advantage of acquisition opportunities in the near future, while still maintaining an indirect interest in the three power plants through our 38.87 per cent shareholding in hk electric.

this transaction underscores the value of our asset portfolio and demonstrates our ability to unlock the value of some of our mature assets.

in spite of the global economic crisis, cki is cautiously optimistic about our future prospects. with our solid financial foundation and strong income base, we are well-placed to face the current challenges in the market.

annual report 2008 9 as a result of the worsening global recession and tightening credit situation, some of the major issues now facing the infrastructure industry are refinancing and over-gearing. however, these issues also give rise to a lot of investment opportunities.

upon the completion of the divestment of our three power plants in mainland china, we will have cash and deposits totalling over hk$11 billion. this cash-rich situation should place cki in a very unique position to support any refinancing needs and to aggressively pursue acquisition opportunities. while we will be vigorously studying new acquisition targets, we will apply stringent investment criteria in order to maximise our advantage in today s market conditions.

i would like to take this opportunity to thank the board, management and staff of cki for their continued hard work and efforts, as well as our shareholders for their confidence in the group.
