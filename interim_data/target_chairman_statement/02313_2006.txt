during the year, the group s vertically integrated production process was optimized through consolidation in assets, businesses and management.
process standards and team work at each stage were further enhanced with a focus on customer service, while further improvements were made in terms of quality, delivery schedules and processes.
regional diversification in operation and product diversification represent two important focuses in the group s development. regional diversification allows customers to free themselves from the influences of geographical, political or economical factors, such as exchange rate fluctuations or changes in government policies, etc. during the year, the group s strategically established garment factory in phnom penh, cambodia was commissioned in late september, 2005. combining with quotas of chinese textile exports to europe and the u.s. and aided by tariff concessions, the group s strategic investments in cambodia will go a long way supporting its expansion initiatives in europe and the u.s. the group also made substantial progress in product diversification during the year. sales contribution from sports wear rose to account for close to 10% of the group s total sales as a result of the launch of new sports wear products.
the group s achievements in regional diversification in supply and product diversification have actively enhanced the competitive strengths of the group and contributed favorably to further moves in market expansion.
on the foundation of a solid and stable development with our japanese customers mainly represented by uniqlo, the group has made progress on the establishment of relationships with renowned brand name customers such as adidas, nike and puma as these customers placed larger orders during the year and there were indications that the volume of their orders would grow rapidly. for the year ended 31 december 2005, sports wear contributed to 8.8% of the group s total sales for the year, as compared to 1.9% in 2004.

as the largest knitwear exporter in china, the group benefited from the prc government s adjustments to the quota system and was advantageously positioned in the distribution of 2006 quotas for chinese textile products to europe and the u.s.. the group was awarded a quota of over 11 million pieces in the results-based distribution. the available quota will lend strong support to the group s expansion initiatives in europe and looking to the future, the group will seek to achieve continuous growth in sales and profit by capturing every expansion opportunity in the market.
we will increase our integrated strengths in production, quality, market share, management and clientele to enhance our marketing efforts to step up expansion in europe and the u.s., while consolidating our existing market share and customer base in japan.
the group has formulated strategies to cope with further appreciation of rmb and rising costs of raw materials and direct labor. aside from encouraging innovation, developing higher-end products and cultivating good customers, we also strengthened cost controls on production processes, in particular the dyeing and finishing processes, in a bid to maintain stable growth in profit while increasing sales.
the board and the audit committee have strived to work closely with all members to devise the overall strategies and objectives of the group, including the development of management tenets for more effective control and balance of business risks on the part of the management. all staff members of the company are dedicated to the pursuit of excellence in corporate governance and a fair and equitable decision-making process in order to ensure a high level of transparency and open communications with all shareholders and investors.
