chairman s statement in 2011, the european sovereign debt crisis continued to deteriorate and the global economic recovery struggled onward with diffi culties. in china, economic growth shifted orderly from policy stimulus to a self-sustaining mode, yet its economic development was still faced with pronounced contradictions and problems with its unbalanced, uncoordinated and unsustainable elements. proactively responding to the diffi culties and challenges brought about by these complex and serious situations, the bank maintained the momentum of healthy and steady development and successfully accomplished the second three-year development plan following its joint-stock reform. it achieved new milestones and advances in many fi elds, and remained to be the world s top listed bank measured by many indicators such as market capitalization and customer deposits.
