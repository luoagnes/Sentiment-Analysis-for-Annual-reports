the overall performance of the garment operation has improved slightly. the majority of the sales were from oem nylon products. although the gross profit margin was lower than the direct sales from ixesse, the group saved significant direct selling expenses and hence loss for the year decreased significantly by 58.5%.
the group recognised that it is desirable to focus more effort on the oem business, not only from the nylon t-shirt line, but also to other knitwear products.
with the establishment of our reputation in the oem industry, some well known brand names have approached us to explore co-operation in the coming 2008 spring summer collections.

the group generated interest income of hk$40,218,000 for the year, which was 8.2% higher than the hk$37,157,000 in 2006. the increase was due to the higher basic interest rates on general and structured deposits. the group will maintain a prudent policy and will diversify its investment when necessary.

the associate company incurred a loss of hk$1,834,000 for the year (2006: hk$255,000).
after operating the business for three years, the associate company found that the existing capacity was not fully utilised and incurred certain unnecessary costs. accordingly, the associate company moved to a smaller premises, which can adequately satisfy the operation requirement and also minimize the redundant costs. the associate company has also written off all the idled equipment, renovation and removal costs which led to a loss of hk$1,834,000.
animal tests and clinical trials on the result of winuboost had been conducted on a parallel basis. however, the clinical trials which had been conducted for over nine months were terminated because of difficulties in recruitment of sufficient suitable patients with the specific disease.
as regards the animal tests, the associate company got the expected results on winuboost and will continue to carry out further tests to prove the product functions of winuboost.

the board is of the view that the group will continue to face severe competition and high operating costs in both its garments and health food business. however, the group will take appropriate measures with a view to improving the performance of these two operations.
the group maintains a conservative investments policy for the surplus fund with a primary objective that the investments should be capital protected and generate sufficient cash flow for the operations.
on behalf of the board, i would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation to all business partners, staff and shareholders for their continuous support.
