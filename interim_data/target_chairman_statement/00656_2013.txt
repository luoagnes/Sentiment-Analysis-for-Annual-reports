the group has initially established an insurance business model driven by three growth drivers , namely property and casualty insurance, life insurance and re-insurance. this has been a crucial step in our pursuit of a secured source of high-quality capital in the long run and continuously strengthening of our investment capabilities. currently, funds available for investing from the insurance business comprise rmb8,900.0 million and usd550.0 million.

development opportunities for fosun china will remain as the main driver of global economic growth in the future. china s economy has begun to stabilize since the second half of 2012, when the country s pmi hovered above the 50% expansiondecline watershed for three consecutive months in the fourth quarter.
china s annual gdp growth will hover between 7% and 9% in the next five years. meanwhile, starting from a relatively underdeveloped basis, the midwest regions of china will experience more rapid growth than the eastern region driven by the new round of urbanization development initiatives (in 2012, the gdp growth rates of provinces in the midwest regions such as sichuan, yunnan and inner mongolia were generally in excess of 10%, significantly higher than those in the developed eastern region).
following a phase of explosive growth in the last five years, the internet has initiated profound changes in some industries (such as distribution of computer software via cd-roms, traditional printed books, production of audio and video works, newspapers and magazines and mobile handsets) and has inflicted long-lasting impacts on some industries (such as retail, electrical appliances, hotel, finance, telecommunications and logistics). fosun believes that the internet will impact further on traditional industries such as property and manufacturing industries, etc.
however, we have taken note of the fact that certain services that involve customer experience will never be completely substituted by the internet (such as fitness, food & beverage, travel and cinemas). meanwhile, integration of the internet and traditional industries has given birth to a number of new business models, effected adjustments to relevant investment logics, given rise to emergence of new investment opportunities that one cannot afford to ignore.
as for manufacturing industries, in the short term, the cost advantage of china s manufacturing industries will mainly rest with supply chain management and production outsourcing services, etc. in the long run, advanced manufacturing technologies such as 3d printing and industrial robotics may change the landscape and division of labor within the value chain throughout the manufacturing industries in the medium to long term. the manufacturing industry reflux to developed countries will bring about investment opportunities to these countries in the area of localization of manufacturing operations. also, countries that are still benefiting from their abundance of population dividends, like india, will bring new competition to china s low-end manufacturing industries in the form of job migrations.
with a new round of monetary easing policies implemented by major economies around the world, inflation will probably become a major subject of discussion in economics for the long term. industries that derive benefits from inflation, that are capable of beating inflation or immune to inflation will embrace investment opportunities in the long run.
in the area of changing demographic structure, the world will be facing a long-term problem of ageing of the population. for example, in china, the dependency ratio will increase substantially in the next 40 years, but the social security system in china does not have the full capacity to meet the expenditure demand from the distribution of benefits arising from the ageing population. therefore, the insurance industry, in particular the life insurance industry, will have long-term growth opportunities. at the same time, ageing will also be embracing long-term growth opportunities in the sectors of pharmaceuticals and healthcare, caring for the elderly and property development for the elderly.
in china, apart from the transformation of the overall economic structure of china towards consumption-driven and service industry-driven, we have also observed three major trends: first, rapid growth in affluence of chinese residents will bring about long-term opportunities to the wealth management business and the luxury goods industry. china has become the world s fourth largest country with the highest concentration of high net worth individuals and the second largest market in luxury products consumption; second, ratio of direct financing in china will continue to increase. this change in financing structure will drive the long-term growth in the securities industry and the private equity industry; third, china will continue to deepen its urbanization. newer styles in building of cities and towns will propagate the urbanization process throughout the heartland of china in a development model that better accommodates the needs of economic transformation in the country. a new round of urbanization will bring about development opportunities to the property industry, energy conservation and environmental protection industries and modern agricultural industry.
the development direction of fosun for industrial operations, fosun pharma will continue to deepen structural adjustments of its businesses to secure sustainable rapid development of its core businesses, while accelerating the pace of mergers and acquisitions within the industry. this will allow fosun pharma to become a leading company in healthcare products and services. forte will adhere strictly to a rapid asset turnover model, enhance its systematic project development capabilities, strengthen cost management, deepen implementation of standardized project series and raise the quality of its growth. it will deepen its foothold in first and second-tier cities, strive to replenish its land bank at reasonable costs, rebalance its product portfolios in selected cities. meanwhile, forte s property funds platform will be optimized and integrated, with more stringent risk management in place, aiming at creating better returns for shareholders. in 2013, nanjing nangang will leverage its edge in integrated management of production, sales and research activities to upgrade its products and improve quality, striving to achieve profitability. hainan mining will further improve its production and sales capabilities. in addition to optimizing production and operations at its base, it will develop and enhance its management and investment capabilities to groom itself into a leading domestic large-scale mining company with world-renowned edges in management and resources, and will proactively pursue its share listing.
for investment, against a backdrop of major economic trends outlined above, we will adhere to our investment philosophy and stay on identifying and tapping more growth investment opportunities in the china market. we will adhere to value investment as we target our radar screen on industries and enterprises that we see potential. we will pursue our investments during down cycles, add value to the investees through optimizing their management, make our divestures at more favorable timings in order to better realize value discovery, value creation and value actualization. we will adhere to our china momentum-driven principles. opportunities that fit into our investment model of combining china s growth momentum with global resources will emerge systematically as a result of the changing economic dynamics in china. we will be able to accumulate more cases of success that are guided by this investment principle. we will invest more in industries that benefit from inflation, high-growth industries that are able to beat inflation and immune to inflation. we will invest more in industries and enterprises that benefit from the development of the internet.
for asset management, we will proceed further with the establishment of an integrated financing platform for limited partners. through product innovation, we will greatly expand cooperation with insurance companies in the areas of property development for the elderly and healthcare treatment, and a fund management system centered on serving limited partners will be established. meanwhile, we will strengthen our fund raising capabilities in the overseas markets and enhance our financing team buildings.
for insurance business, yong an p&c insurance will catalyze on opportunities arising from the construction of an international shipping center in shanghai to expand into marine insurance, including coverage for vessels and freights. pramerica fosun life insurance will continue to proliferate its existing sales channels to facilitate its access to the high-end insurance market and further improve the quality of its product lines.
peak reinsurance is a newly invested reinsurance company by the group in hong kong, which will inflict strategic implications on the group s development in the future.
mission, vision and objectives of fosun our vision is to become a premium investment group.
in the future, we will establish an investment platform gradually and selectively through various methods (such as by attracting talents, establishing teams, through investment and mergers and acquisitions, etc.) on a global basis, across different industries, throughout the whole industrial chain and in a fully commercial manner, so as to make more high-return investments and accelerate the pursuit of our strategic development objective of becoming a premium investment group.
