business development in china to increase our investment in mainland gas projects is a long-term strategic priority for development of the group s core business. china s entry into the world trade organisation is boosting prosperity of the national economy leading to an increasing need for energy, in particular a surge in the demand for clean fuel. it is the national policy of mainland china to improve the air quality of its cities through improving the energy structure. this can be achieved by promoting the use of natural gas to replace coal and heavy oil. the construction of infrastructure for the supply of natural gas is therefore encouraged. in line with this environmental policy of mainland china, the group is actively participating in some of the major national environmentally-friendly energy projects, including the guangdong liquefied natural gas receiving terminal and trunkline project and the west-to-east gas pipeline project. investment in these two national energy projects has helped the group to tap into downstream city gas businesses.

in tandem with the strategy for the development of energy businesses in mainland china, the group has set up an investment holding company, hong kong & china gas investment limited, the incorporation of which was approved by the state ministry of foreign trade and economic cooperation in february, 2002.
