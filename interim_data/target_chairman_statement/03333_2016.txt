looking forward to 2016, the board is of the view that under the new normal led by the reform of the supply side, china s economy will maintain moderately rapid growth and long-term promising outlook with a stable real estate industry as an economic pillar, and the industry still enjoys ongoing and positive stimulus policies and measures aimed at encouraging house purchases such as reduction in down payment percentage, interest rate and reserve requirement ratio cuts and relaxation of housing provident fund withdrawal. meanwhile, the real estate market will undergo radical evolutions driven by emerging trends such as restoration of the property inherent value, polarization of the market and financialization of the industry, and this historical process will be dominated by those enterprises with enormous resources and advanced management and based on the research on the new normal of china s economy and the real estate industry, the board will adopt comprehensive measures to optimize the regional layout of residential housing projects, to firmly strengthen sales and collection of sales proceeds, to put costs and expenses under tight control, to increase cash balance and profit margins, and to strictly control leverage ratio. the board also strives to continuously improve profitability while maintaining stability and to facilitate diversified, quality and coordinated development by consolidating its principal real in 2016, the group will further optimize the regional layout of its residential housing projects, acquire high quality projects in an enterprising, prudent and pragmatic fashion, and secure a leading position in terms of land reserves in the industry. the group also puts greater emphasis on profitability improvement and quality and coordinated development for project expansion, and still focuses its regional layout on first- and second-tier cities especially in the central urban areas. land acquisitions in the third-tier cities, however, will be carried out based on stricter quantifiable criteria to raise the gross profit margins of products. cost-effective and efficient ways to acquire projects, such as mergers and acquisitions and cooperation in property development, will become the major means of as at 31 december 2015, the aggregate land premium of the group amounted to rmb293.29 billion with rmb247.31 billion paid and rmb45.98 billion outstanding, of which rmb9.48 billion, rmb5.22 billion, rmb16.30 billion and rmb14.98 billion are scheduled to be paid in the first half of 2016, in the second half of 2016, in 2017 and in 2018 or the group foresees a relatively loose policy environment with increasingly divergent regional markets in 2016. as such, the group will follow the market trends, ensure adequate inventories, and focus on key project sales in key regions. in particular, the group will continue to break down its annual sales target to the project level and initiate enough marketing activities from the beginning of the year so as to ensure the achievement of its annual sales target.
the group has determined its contracted sales target in 2016 at rmb200 billion, 11.1% higher than its increased target in 2015. the group has dozens of new residential projects available for sale, most of which are located in major cities, including beijing, shanghai, shenzhen, tianjin, chongqing, hangzhou, nanjing, chengdu and dalian.
based on the overall marketing strategy, the group plans to market these projects by selectively prioritizing certain projects with appropriate timing. in addition, the group has reserved several projects used for residential and commercial purposes and a large amount of stores and parking spaces in the residential projects, which are expected to supplement the contracted sales of the year.
as the group continuously promotes the strategy of optimizing the regional layout of projects and substantially increases the added value of its products by upgrading supporting facilities, decoration standards and housing structures, the average transaction price for the year is expected to increase further. as to the specific pricing strategy, the group will strike a balance between sales price and sales volume and between scale and gross profit to achieve positive growth for both. sales targets are designated on a quarterly basis, and the sales results will be reviewed on a monthly basis. the monthly sales results are reported to shareholders and investors by voluntary announcements. given the adequate inventories, strong execution capability and product advantages of the group, the board is very confident that the group can achieve its full-year contracted sales target.

the group will continue to maintain its steady financial policies, endeavor to raise the total amount of cash and maintain its net profit margin for its main operations. to accomplish this, the group will further enhance the collection of sales proceeds, set reasonable sales price, increase the turnover of inventories, promote sales of commercial premises and continue to expand project cooperation.
meanwhile, the group will formulate more reasonable plans for commencement, completion and payment, and rationally control expenditures on land and construction.
with respect to capital arrangement, we have used the proceeds from issuance of corporate bonds and private bonds primarily to repay the existing debts to improve the debt structure and the remaining amount to replenish general working capital. the group implemented strict payment management plans while leveraging diversified financing channels and managing the dynamic balance between capital inflow and outflow.
along with the ease of monetary policy of the prc central government, we are expecting more opportunities to finance in the future. we are exploring new channels of debt financing to lower our current debt ratio and borrowing with respect to the control of costs and expenses, the group will continue to fully implement reforms of product upgrades and standardization to ensure product quality and reduce costs. the group will also utilize new promotion channels to lower its selling expenses, develop leading sap and erp systems in the industry and make full use of information technology to further reduce operating the board recommended a final dividend for the year ended 31 december 2015 of rmb0.38 per share to shareholders whose names appear on the register of members on 22 june 2016. the final dividend will be paid on or before 4 july the payment of the final dividend is subject to the approval by the shareholders of the company at the forthcoming annual general meeting.
