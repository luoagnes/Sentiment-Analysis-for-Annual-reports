1. business review in 2015, the global economic picture was mixed.
development in the united states was relatively satisfactory, with firm improvement in employment, while significant drops in commodity prices and a strong dollar coupled with interest rate rises in december led to clear signs of capital outflows from emerging markets, increasing the downside risks of both economic development and currency. economic development in the eurozone and japan was weak. there was slight improvement with the implementation of more easing measures; geopolitical problems in the middle east, europe and asia roiled global against this background of sluggish economic growth globally, the chinese central government promulgated a number of measures designed to stabilise growth, including increased investment in infrastructure and a moderate easing of monetary policies to improve liquidity, with several reductions in the required reserve ratio and lending rate from november 2014. china s foreign trade showed no sign of significant improvement, while the cpi and ppi continued to drop. weak momentum in the economy resulted in an annual economic growth rate of 6.9%, still meeting the target of about 7.0%. the global economic slowdown meant there was only mild economic growth in hong kong and macau.
as china s economic growth slowed, the central government relied increasingly on the property sector to promote economic development. since 2014, tightening measures in the property sector have gradually been relaxed. other than in the four tier-one cities, policy now generally supports the sector. furthermore, policies on buying homes and arranging mortgages have been relaxed.
