2010 2011 2012 distribution per unit (hk$) distributable income (hk$ mil) level of debt 2010 2011 2012 in hk$ (billions) total revenue for 2012 improved by 6.1% to hk$2,059 million. this was an across-the-board improvement with income growth at each of our individual properties. income at citibank plaza increased due to a higher average occupancy rate in spite of a challenging office leasing environment in central. at the same time, our langham place office tower continued to capitalize on the buoyant office market outside of central. the langham place mall also turned in a strong performance on rising retail and tourist spending in hong kong. total net property income improved by 6.6% over the previous year, to hk$1,666 million.
in recent months, champion reit has taken steps to strengthen its capital structure. in august 2012, we issued an invitation to convertible bondholders to convert their bonds. as a result, bonds in a total nominal value of hk$ 2,340 million were converted. the trust s debt decreased from hk$14,059 million to hk$12,219 million as of 31 december 2012, primarily because of this exercise. the gearing ratio saw a corresponding improvement, decreasing from 25.0% to 20.4%. the appraised value of the reit s properties increased 6.3% to hk$58,297 million. net asset value per unit however decreased marginally from hk$7.82 to hk$7.80 due to the new units issued in association with the bond conversion.
profit after tax decreased to hk$4,160 million for the year mainly due to lower net revaluation gains of only hk$3,435 million as compared to hk$4,635 million for 2011. excluding revaluation gains and other items that are non-cash in nature, distributable income for the period was up 7.1%, to hk$1,254 million. the distribution amount, after retention of hk$68 million, is hk$1,186 million, an increase of 6.8% over that of 2011. the effective distribution ratio for 2012 is 94.6%. the distribution per unit ( dpu ) for the second half of the year is hk$0.1074. combined with the hk$0.1018 paid out for the first half, the total dpu for the year is hk$0.2092, which is down 6.4% from hk$0.2236 for 2011, due to the conversion of bonds.
on the financing side, we are expecting a higher cost of funding in 2013. we have taken steps to reduce our reliance on the banking market and secured some long-term funding by issuing medium-term notes. at the end of 2012 champion reit launched a new unsecured medium term note ( mtn ) platform. it will serve to diversify the trust s sources of funding, lengthen debt maturities and lock in long term rates. early in january 2013, taking advantage of a window of high liquidity, us$400 million of 10-year notes at a coupon rate of 3.75% were issued. while the hong kong interbank offered rates should remain low, the credit spreads charged by banks upon refinancing will be materially higher. the transition of a portion of our debt to a long term unsecured basis will also entail some higher interest costs in the short term, as the benefits of fixed-rate funding will be felt over a long period. furthermore, the early drawdown of our mtn to take advantage of a liquidity window in the bond market will entail extra interest costs until refinancing takes place in early june. taking into account these factors, an increase in interest expenses for 2013 is expected.
overall, there has yet to be any strong signals of a turnaround in the central office market and there could be some moderate downside for the income of citibank plaza in the coming year. fortunately, the strong rental growth at both the langham place office tower and langham place mall should be able to offset any potential income weakness at citibank plaza. nonetheless higher interest costs may hold back the growth in our distributable income. we will continue to monitor our various financing options to optimize our capital structure and funding costs. at the same time, we will continue to actively manage our two trophy assets to maximize rental income over the long term.

approach to leasing our leasing strategy is to maximize cumulative rental income over time
uring 2012 the central grade-a office market continued to be plagued by weak demand from banks, whose business scopes have been curtailed by tighter regulations.
the lingering uncertainties associated with the euro debt crisis and the looming u.s. fiscal cliff also did not help sentiments.
notwithstanding the limited new supply of office space, the overall vacancy in central went up during course of the year. rental rates continued their downward trend from 2011 and saw further corrections in the early part of the year. however towards the end of the year the decline in rent rates began to moderate with the help of demand from mainland- chinese corporates as well as fund managers and law firms building an initial presence in hong kong.
passing rental rates (the average rental rate of existing tenancies) have stayed around hk$85-86 per sq. ft. throughout 2012 as rent rates achieved on new and renewal leases were as a whole more or less equal to the rates of expiring leases. the average monthly passing rent as of yearend 2012 was hk$85.12 per sq. ft.
the occupancy rate at citibank plaza remained relatively steady through the year. it was 90.4% at the beginning of the year, 88.7% by midyear and 89.1% as of 31 december. the average occupancy for 2012 was 89.0%, which was higher than that of 87.6% for 2011.
because of that, revenue from citibank plaza increased by 4.5% to net property income operating expenses citibank plaza langham plaza net property income 2010 2011 2012 in hk$ (millions) 2010 2011 2012 in hk$ (millions) operating expenses fell 1.5% to hk$205 million. while there was a hk$27 million reduction in rental commissions because of the smaller amount of leases expiring this year, it was offset by increases in building management fees of hk$9 million, government rents and rates of hk$8 million and promotion expenses of hk$6 million. the net property income of citibank plaza increased 5.8% to hk$1,001 million.

the resilience of the hong kong economy outside of the financial sector has sustained demand for office space across all office districts outside of the central financial district. coupled with a relatively low level of new completions during the year, the market for grade-a offices in kowloon, including those along the tsim sha tsui yau ma tei mongkok corridor where the langham place office tower is situated, was generally strong in 2012. as tenants in life-style trades took up more space, the occupancy rate of langham place office tower improved from 96.8% at the end of 2011 to 99.2% as of 31 december 2012.
passing rents rose steadily over the course of 2012 from hk$27.43 at the beginning of the year to hk$28.36 per sq. ft. at the end as higher rent rates were achieved on rollover of leases.
