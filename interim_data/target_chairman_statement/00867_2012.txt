in 2011, uncertain policies and the downturn of chinese pharmaceutical market resulted in unprecedented challenges for the pharmaceutical industry. during the volatile conditions of the chinese pharmaceutical market in 2011, the group still achieved satisfactory results growth, as a result of the right position and firm implementation of our two core strategies-the continuous introduction and development of products and expansion of promotion and sales network.
product introduction and development in 2011, the group remained committed to introducing and developing products. during the reporting period, while maintaining the steady growth of its two flagship products-deanxit and ursofalk-the group also increased its investment and intensity of promotion on other potential products, organized over 1,000 academic activities at various levels, continuously advanced the formation of expert networks and brands, increased the number of prescription doctors, boosted the doctors prescription volume and further strengthened the depth of coverage of products in hospitals. at the same time, the introduction of the agency promotion model also broadened the scope and channel of the group s product screening. during the reporting period, the group not only continued products screening for the direct academic orientated promotion network (the direct network ), but also included screening for products suitable for the agency promotion network (the agency network ).

in addition, the group already owns the product rights of tyroseuleutide (cms024) in china. tyroseuleutide is used in the treatment of primary liver cancer and has huge potential market value in china. the group has already commenced tyroserleutide phase iii clinical study in 2011. the title of the phase iii study of tyroserleutide being conducted now is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter phase iii study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tyroserleutide for injection in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma , and the primary purpose of the study is to verify the efficacy of tyroserleutide on prolonging recurrence-free survival ( rfs ) and overall survival ( os ) of the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. the clinical study will be conducted in 26 class three hospitals which are at the leading level of the liver cancer field in china. as at 31 december 2011, the group has already successfully started kick-off meetings of tyroserleutide phase iii clinical trial during 18 hospitals in china, and has already enrolled 4 subjects. if the clinical trial can be smoothly completed, it will have a significant and positive impact on the groups performance in the future.

meanwhile, the group has already signed three products from late 2010 to early 2011 that require import drug registration in china, and the application of clinical trial for registration of budenofalk has been accepted by the state food and drug administration ( sfda ) during the first half of 2011. these three products are effective complements to our existing strong therapeutic departments, and after the completion of the import drug registration, the group can make use of the existing promotion and sales network and expert resources to achieve rapid product coverage. moreover, the group has several other products under the negotiation process.
in the future, the group will continue to consider each of the three product introduction strategies, and at the same time build up diversified approaches such as purchases or equity controls to acquire more stable product during the reporting period, the group continued to expand its marketing and promotion network, aside from expanding the geographical reach and hospital coverage of the promotion network, the group also focused on integrating and developing the direct network and agency network. during the reporting period, the group sales spanned over 14,600 hospitals throughout china, of which almost 8,600 hospitals were covered by the direct network and over 7,800 hospitals were covered by the agency network.
