statement from chairman
in the past two years, china s economy continued its structural transition, with declining growth momentum.
as a result the consumer retail market experienced prolonged weakness. faced with a weak retail market and a challenging business environment, all my colleagues continued to work hard as one united team and achieved both positive revenue growth and positive profit growth. we managed to consolidate market share and improve market competitiveness. i would like to take this opportunity to thank all my colleagues for their for the fourteen months ended 28 february 2014 the group grew revenues by 10.1%, operating profits by 4.1%, profit attributable to equity holders of the company by 1.0%, as compared with the same period of last year. the group continued to expand company-managed retail network. as at 28 february 2014 the total number of company-managed retail outlets reached 19,333, of which 19,177 were located in mainland china, 156 in hong kong and macau.
