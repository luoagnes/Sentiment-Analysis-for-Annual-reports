chinese economy maintained a steady and rapid growth momentum, riding on synergetic effects of strongly rebounded industrial production, robust domestic demand and rapid growth of export.
as macro-economy situation improved, the coal industry continued to develop steadily, which was evidenced by the rapid growth of production volume, new high record of coal import and periodical fluctuation of coal prices at high levels coupled with the changes of supply and demand.
the company had made tremendous efforts to mitigate any adverse impact in relation to safety production, arranged its production scientifically, strengthened the interconnection among coal production, transportation and sales stage and proactively adjusted its industrial structure, which ensured rapid growth in its operation and laid a solid foundation for the company s future china coal energy company limited annual report 2010 chairman s statement during the reporting period, the company s raw coal production was 122.53 million tons, representing a year-on-year increase of 21.6%.
commercial coal production was 94.38 million tons, representing a year-on-year increase of 17.2%. commercial coal sales amounted to 117.27 million tons, representing a year-on-year increase of 20.6%. the company recorded revenue of rmb70.303 billion, representing a year-on-year increase of 32.2%. profit before income tax of the company amounted to rmb10.999 billion. basic earnings per share amounted to rmb0.56.
