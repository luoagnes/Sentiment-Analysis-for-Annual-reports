on behalf of haitian international holdings limited, ( haitian or the company ), with its subsidiaries (together, the group ), i am pleased to present the group s annual results for the year ended 31 december 2013.

2013 continued to be a challenging year for the machine manufacturing industry but it was also a year of achievements for haitian.
in 2013, we achieved both record revenue and profit. this sensational achievement evidences our committed efforts in maintaining our industry leadership in terms of revenue, technology innovation and operational efficiency.
in 2013, china continued to experience a mild slowdown in economic growth. although the domestic operating environment stabilized, the pimm market is still far from full recovery. the global economy performance is also mixed. we observed gradual recovery in the us economy and stabilization of the europe sovereign debt issues. in contrast, many emerging markets experience a slow-down of economic growth and currency deprecation issues in view of us s quantitative easing measures approaching the end, which affect investment confidence in these markets. faced with complicated and volatile operating environments, we adhered to our core development strategy of commitment to product innovation to address customer need. with our launch of second generation ( generation 2 ) of existing product lines since 2nd half of 2012, the generation 2 s features of high precision, reliability and price-performance ratio continue to attract customers and induce them to invest in new haitian machines even under the relatively sluggish market environment. once again, we outperformed the industry peers and achieved the highest-ever revenue in our history. we recorded revenue of rmb7,200.7 million for the year ended 31 december 2013 (the reported period ) increased by 13.7% compared to 2012, continuing to maintain the leading position in our industry.
with better cost position and margin of generation 2, and accompanied with improved operational efficiency, benefit of economic of scale and relatively stable steel related component costs, we continued to improve the gross profit margin to 31.6% (2012: 30.1%) and net profit margin to 16.8% (2012: 15.6%). as a result, the group s profit attributable to shareholders for the reported period increased to rmb1,206.2 million, representing an increase of 22.3% when compared to 2012, achieving a new record in our the board of directors has declared a second interim dividend of hk$0.16 per share for the year ended 31 december 2013 (2012: final dividend: hk$0.15), bringing the total dividend for 2013 to hk$0.31 per share (2012: hk$0.27).
domestic and export sales the group s sales by geographic areas are summarized in the following table: (rmb million) 2013 % 2012 % domestic sales 4,975.9 69.1% 4,189.7 66.1% 18.8% export sales 2,061.3 28.6% 1,990.0 31.4% 3.6% parts (both domestic and export) 163.5 2.3% 155.9 2.5% 4.9% total 7,200.7 100% 6,335.6 100.0% 13.7% the domestic pimm market had experienced a softening in the past two years and the market has started to move from stagnation to slight recovery, driven by the continuous increase in plastic products consumption and stabilizing economic environment.
customers start to resume capital expenditure in pimms in view of a more clear business outlook. with our highly competitive generation 2, we are in a prime position to capitalise on the growing demand from this positive momentum and raise our market share in the industry. our domestic sales recorded an increase of 18.8% from rmb4,189.7 million in 2012 to rmb4,975.9 million in through our strategy of strengthening export sales including developing new markets, setting up a vietnam manufacturing base and enhancing the pre-sales and after-sales services, we made an impressive double digit growth in certain markets like southeast asia, middle east, africa and north america. by offering high-end machines with reasonable price-performance and technology to the point, we also made a remarkable progress in increasing the market share in certain developed and high-technology-requirement countries, which evidenced the increasing recognition of haitian as a world-class brand. in 2013, we recorded a strong increase in sales to united states and south korea and united states has become our third largest single export market. meanwhile, the sales of certain emerging countries like brazil and turkey dropped in 2013 due to their suffering from slow-down of economic growth, currency depreciation and political instability. as a result of the above-mentioned reasons, our export sales recorded an increase of 3.6% from rmb1,990.0 million in 2012 to rmb2,061.3 million in 2013, reaching another new record for our export business.

small and medium-to-large tonnage sales the group s sales by small tonnage and medium-to-large tonnage plastic injection moulding machines are summarized in the (rmb million) 2013 % 2012 % small tonnage 4,545.5 63.1% 3,747.0 59.1% 21.3% medium-to-large tonnage 2,491.7 34.6% 2,432.7 38.4% 2.4% parts 163.5 2.3% 155.9 2.5% 4.9% total 7,200.7 100% 6,335.6 100.0% 13.7% in general, the sales of small tonnage pimm are more sensitive and response faster to changes of market situation and economic performance. matching the initial recovery of domestic pimm markets in china, the sales of the small tonnage pimms increased to rmb4,545.5 million in 2013, representing an increase of 21.3% when compared to the sales in 2012. the sales of medium-to-large tonnage pimms remain at high level even during the previous industry slow down because of relatively low sensitivity to sluggish market environment. with the continuous increase in the application of large pimm machines to various industries, we recorded a stable sales of medium-to-large tonnage pimms which amounted to rmb2,491.7 million in 2013, representing a stable growth of 2.4% when compared to the sales in 2012.
research and development sustainable success in innovation is founded upon bringing new technology consistently meeting the demand of customers.
fundamentally, this means each new technology must bring the customers new advantages and concrete benefits exactly to the point with justified costs. therefore we developed our generation 2 machines with a target to expand the potential of standardized processes and optimize the cost position and profitability of customers to achieve a perfect symbiosis of the greatest possible economic efficiency and the best possible performance.
with several patented new features such as optimized injection, new mechanical clamping systems and new software for enhanced applications, generation 2 offers higher precision, reliability, speed and price-performance to our customers. the market response to generation 2 is extremely positive: the sales of mars, venus and jupiter series increased by 18%, 22% and 39% respectively in 2013. currently, our sales are mainly attributable to generation 2 machines.
our efforts in r&d and innovation are well reflected in our haitian brand. in the 2013 value evaluation results of chinese independent brands in manufacturing industry conducted by cctv together with china national institute of standardization, china association for brand construction promotion, china council for the promotion of international trade and china appraisal society, our haitian brand achieved a brand value of rmb7.3 billion and brand strength of 83.13%, being one of the top 10 brand value in the machinery manufacturing industry. our prestigious brand value is the evidence of our long term commitment in attentive customer services, customer-orientated innovation and rigorous quality. we will continue our striving as a world-class brand.

notwithstanding the fact that chinese pimm market is still far from full recovery and only showed a mild recovery in 2013, we still achieved a record level of revenue and profit. unlike the overheated level in 2010 which was distorted by the release of suppressed capex after the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, we believe the growth of demand in pimms will be in a more sustainable way which is driven by continuous increase in plastics consumption and new plastic application, on-going urbanization and rising personal income levels in china. accordingly, we plan to expand our production capacity to meet the further growth along with increasing our flexibility by adopting a temporarily stretched production plans using working over time and outsourcing production. in order to further increase our production capacity, raise our efficiency through modernization of the production process and upgrading vertical production capabilities, we are in the progress of constructing two new factories in ningbo which will be completed and ready for operation in 2014. this also coincides with our strategies of the full-scale development of our zhafir brand high-end series of full electric pimms and upgrading the medium-to-large size pimms towards manufacturing large size two-platen pimms.
in order to maintain our competitive advantages to be sustainable in the future, we see communication, innovation and efficiency as the three most important pillars for joint success. we will continue to actively communicate with our customers, employees and suppliers to exchange information and experience, obtain the feedback and then deal with their demand. through the active communication, we can also achieve innovation that offers meaningful benefits to customers in the plastic processing process and also efficiency in our operation to further increase the profitability. in november 2013, our key management and major departments (including domestic and export sales, r&d, it and administrative department etc.) were relocated to our new centralised headquarter building in ningbo which further enhances our communication and efficiency. the new headquarter building set another milestone for haitian to reach next height.
with the ambition in sustainable steady development of our business, we cannot disregard that there remains some fragility in the economic outlook and we need to be cautious in considering such uncertainties, including possible impact of scale down of us quantitative easing polices, recent slow-down of china s manufacturing sector as indicated from china pmi falling below 50 since january 2014, the possibility of further currency depreciation in certain emerging countries and latest development in ukraine s situation etc. we will continue to increase our flexibility to tackle the challenges and react quickly to the market dynamics amidst uncertain economic environment through our long term committed strategies in speeding up product innovation, providing technological product to the point by addressing customers needs, carefully adjusting our production plan to achieve optimized utilization of production capacity, launching quality assurance campaign and enhancing our pre-sales and after-sales services. leveraging on our prestigious brand, outstanding price-to-performance ratio, self-developed core technology and efficient production scale, we are confident to maintain our industry-leading position, deliver solid performance in 2014 and bring satisfactory returns to our shareholders.

finally, on behalf of the board of directors, i would like to thanks all staff members for their contribution in the past year and at the same time, i would also like to express our gratitude towards our shareholders, customers, suppliers and business partners for their continued confidence in and support to our group.
