chairman s letter the cathay pacific group reported an attributable profit of hk$916 million for 2012. this compares to an attributable profit of hk$5,501 million for 2011. earnings per share fell by 83.3% to hk23.3 cents. turnover for the year increased by 1.0% to hk$99,376 million.
in 2012 the group s core business was adversely affected by the high price of jet fuel, pressure on passenger yields and weak air cargo demand. economic uncertainty, particularly in the eurozone countries, and an increasingly competitive environment added to the difficulties. it was a challenging year for the aviation industry generally. the group s share of profits from associated companies, including air china, showed a marked decline.
our passenger revenue for the year was hk$70,133 million, an increase of 3.5% compared to 2011. capacity increased by 2.6%. we carried a total of 29.0 million passengers in 2012, a rise of 5.0% compared to the previous year. the passenger load factor fell by 0.3 percentage points. yield increased by 1.2% to hk67.3 cents, largely due to higher fuel surcharges consequent upon a 1.7% increase in average fuel prices.
uncertain economic conditions and strong competition on key routes put pressure on yields. premium class yields were affected by travel restrictions imposed by corporations. the high cost of fuel made it more difficult to operate profitably, particularly on long-haul routes operated by older, less fuel- efficient, boeing 747-400 and airbus a340-300 aircraft.
the group s cargo revenue in 2012 was hk$24,555 million, a decrease of 5.5% compared to 2011. yield for cathay pacific and dragonair remained the same as last year at hk$2.42.
capacity was down by 3.1%. the cargo load factor was down by 3.0 percentage points to 64.2%. our cargo business was affected by weak demand in major markets, particularly from asia to europe. demand for shipments from our two key markets, hong kong and mainland china, was well below expectations, although there were short-term upturns in march and in the last quarter, reflecting launches of new consumer electronics products. capacity was adjusted in line with demand. we opened new routes where demand was robust.
we introduced freighter services to zhengzhou in mainland china in march, hyderabad in india in may and colombo in sri lanka in december. we suspended our freighter service to zaragoza in spain in november 2012 and those to brussels in belgium and stockholm in sweden in february 2013.
fuel is our most significant cost. throughout much of 2012, fuel prices were at sustained high levels and this had a major impact on our operating results. the group s fuel costs (disregarding the effect of fuel hedging) increased by 0.8% compared to 2011. fuel accounted for 41.1% of our total operating costs a decrease of 0.4 of a percentage point from the previous year. managing the risk associated with high and the cathay pacific group reported an attributable profit of hk$916 million for 2012. this compares to an attributable profit of hk$5,501 million for 2011. earnings per share fell by 83.3% to hk23.3 cents. turnover for the year increased by 1.0% to hk$99,376 million.
sometimes volatile fuel prices remains a key challenge. we took advantage of a reduction in fuel prices in may and june to do more hedging with a view to mitigating the impact of future fuel price increases.
in may 2012, we announced measures designed to protect our business in an environment of high fuel prices and weak revenues. we accelerated the retirement of our less fuel- efficient boeing 747-400 passenger aircraft. three of these aircraft had left the fleet by november. we withdrew from service four boeing 747-400bcf converted freighters. we changed schedules and reduced capacity on some long-haul routes. we stopped all but essential recruitment of ground staff. we introduced voluntary unpaid leave for cabin crew. by the end of the year costs, particularly of fuel and aircraft maintenance, had been reduced significantly from what they would otherwise have been as a result of reduced capacity and early retirement of aircraft. however, the reductions were not enough to offset in full the effects of high fuel prices and at the same time as addressing the challenges to our business, we kept a clear focus on our key strategic goals: developing our network and our hong kong base; maintaining and enhancing the quality of our services (and so protecting the reputation of our brands); strengthening our relationship with air china; and maintaining a prudent approach to financial risk management. we did not allow cost reductions to affect adversely the way in which we deal with our customers. we continued with our major investments in new aircraft and new products. we started to operate our own cargo terminal at hong kong international airport in february 2013. this will bring significant benefits to our own cargo business and to hong kong as a centre for air cargo business.
we continued to upgrade the cathay pacific and dragonair fleets in 2012, taking delivery of new aircraft which improve our operating economics and reduce our environmental impact. we received 19 new aircraft in 2012: four airbus a320- 200s, six airbus a330-300s, five boeing 777-300ers and four boeing 747-8f freighters. we placed orders for six airbus a350-900 aircraft in january 2012. in august, we ordered 10 airbus a350-1000 aircraft and converted an existing order for 16 airbus a350-900 aircraft into an order for 16 airbus a350- 1000 aircraft. at 31st december 2012 we had 92 aircraft on order for delivery up to 2020. because of their high operating costs, we have accelerated the retirement of our boeing 747-400 passenger aircraft. three of the fleet of 21 boeing 747-400s were retired in the second half of 2012. six will be retired in 2013. we reduced the size of our fleet of boeing 747-400bcf converted freighters. four boeing 747-400bcf converted freighters were withdrawn from service and one of them was retired from the fleet in 2012. we withdrew another boeing 747-400bcf from the fleet in february 2013. the third of four boeing 747-400bcfs being sold to air china cargo, our cargo joint venture with air china, was delivered in july 2012.
the final one was sold in march 2013.
in march 2013, we entered into agreements in relation to our freighter fleet which are part of a package of transactions between the boeing company on the one hand and the group, air china cargo (in which we have an equity and an economic interest) and air china on the other hand. the transactions involve the group purchasing three boeing 747-8f freighters, cancelling orders for eight boeing 777-200f freighters, acquiring options to purchase five boeing 777-200f freighters and selling four boeing 747-400bcf converted freighters, air china cargo acquiring eight boeing 777-200f freighters and selling seven boeing 747-400bcf converted freighters and air china purchasing a number of other aircraft.
these transactions will reduce our future cargo capacity (depending on whether we exercise the newly acquired purchase options and certain existing purchase rights) from what it would otherwise have been and allow air china cargo to replace its existing fleet of aircraft with a fleet of modern, fuel-efficient boeing 777-200f freighters. the reduction in our capacity is considered desirable in the light of our reduced expectations for the future growth of air cargo shipments. if these reduced expectations prove misplaced, additional cargo capacity could be obtained by exercising the newly acquired purchase options and our existing purchase rights.
we adjusted our schedules in 2012 in light of the challenging business environment and the high cost of fuel. in september we reduced some passenger services on transpacific routes, enabling fuel-efficient boeing 777-300er aircraft to replace older boeing 747-400 aircraft on some european routes. but we remained committed to maintaining the integrity of our network. we increased some regional services in response to more robust demand in parts of asia. cathay pacific added frequencies on routes to india, japan, malaysia, singapore, taiwan, thailand and vietnam and introduced a new service to hyderabad in india. dragonair added frequencies on routes to secondary cities in mainland china and introduced or resumed flights to eight destinations chiang mai, clark, guilin, haikou, jeju, kolkata, taichung and xi an. in january 2013, dragonair started flying to wenzhou, yangon and zhengzhou and in march will start flying to da nang.
in an increasingly competitive environment it is crucial to maintain and develop passenger loyalty by providing high quality products and services. this remains a key focus of the cathay pacific group. to this end, cathay pacific has introduced a new premium economy class, a new long-haul economy class seat and a new regional business class seat.
since its introduction in april 2012, premium economy class has been very popular on long-haul routes. by the end of 2012, the new class was available on 48 aircraft and will be available on 86 aircraft by the end of 2013. in april 2012, we started to introduce new long-haul economy class seats, which have been well received by passengers. the new regional business class seat was introduced in january 2013. our long-haul business class was named world s best business class in 2012 at the world airline awards run by skytrax. dragonair will also get new business class and economy seats from march 2013. on the ground, we completed refurbishment of the level 7 business class lounge in the wing at hong kong international airport in january 2012. renovations of the first class lounge were completed in february 2013. in august 2012, we opened a new lounge in paris.
our relationship with strategic partner air china continues to strengthen. we announced the formation of a ground- handling company, shanghai international airport services co., limited in march 2012. this joint venture between cathay pacific, air china, the shanghai airport authority and shanghai international airport co. ltd. started to operate in february 2013. it provides airport ground-handling services at shanghai s two international airports, hongqiao and pudong.
the cathay pacific group operates in a volatile and challenging industry, one that will always be highly susceptible to external factors that remain largely beyond our control. the cost of fuel remains the biggest challenge, particularly for an airline such as ours where long-haul operations form a significant part of our total operations. we believe we have taken the right measures to deal with current challenges and will take whatever further measures are necessary should the business environment not improve. our focus will remain on protecting the business and managing short-term difficulties while remaining committed to our long-term strategy. our financial position remains strong and we will continue to invest in the future. our core strengths remain the same as ever: a superb team, a strong international network, exceptional standards of customer service, a strong relationship with air china and our position in hong kong.
these will help to ensure the success of the cathay pacific group in the long term.
