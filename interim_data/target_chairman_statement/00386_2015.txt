in 2014, sinopec corp. made significant progress toward fulfilling the board s core commitment to improve development quality and returns through launching our initiatives to deepen reform, accelerate the transition to new sources of growth, as well as enhance internal management and maintained a favorable growth momentum. we are delighted to see that, with regard to reforms, sinopec s marketing business has established mixed-ownership operations by restructuring and introducing private capital.
this move not only enhanced our enterprise value but also advanced the transition of the business from an oil products supplier to an integrated services provider. with regard to growth mode transformation, commercial operations at the fuling shale gas field commenced ahead of plan with a production capacity of 2 billion cubic meters per year, making china the first country outside north america to develop shale gas for commercial use. we have also fully upgraded our refined oil products and raised the production volume of our premium gasoline, for which growth in demand has been strong. revenues for our non-fuel business in the marketing segment increased 28%. with regard to internal management, sinopec effectively controlled costs for each business segment and conducted its operations safely. our chemical feedstock and product mix also continued to improve due to the scheme of the optimisation of resources.
