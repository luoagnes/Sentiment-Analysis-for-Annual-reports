the property investment sector, like the rest of the hong kong economy, experienced another challenging year in 2002. in this context, i am pleased to report that the overall occupancy levels throughout the group s commercial property portfolio remained strong during the review year (office: 95%, retail: 96%).
net profit for the year ended 31 december 2002 was hk$543.9 million, 9.4% lower than in 2001 (hk$600.3 million). the fall in gross rental income (2002: hk$1,229.6 million; 2001: hk$1,351.9 million) was largely attributable to negative rental reversions and the upgrading renovation works at the bamboo grove residential property.
if bamboo grove is excluded, the fall in gross rental income was 4.9%.
earnings per share were hk52.66 cents, a decrease of 9.6% (hk58.26 cents for the same period in 2001).
the group s investment property portfolio, as valued externally by independent professional valuers, was hk$24,841 million as at 31 december 2002 (2001: hk$26,639 million). largely due to the net valuation deficit, shareholders funds at 2002 year-end were hk$19,087 million, compared to hk$21,267 million in 2001. net asset value per share (before final dividend) decreased by 10.5% to hk$18.45.
detailed commentary on our performance and assets valuation are set out in operating and financial review on pages 4 to 10.

the board recommends the payment of a final dividend of hk26.5 cents per share, which together with the interim dividend of hk10 cents per share, represents an aggregate distribution of hk36.5 cents per share, a decrease of 3.9% for the year. subject to shareholder approval, the final dividend will be payable in cash with a scrip dividend alternative. details on the payment of final dividend, including the scrip dividend arrangements, are set out in shareholder information on the inside back cover.
a challenging year the past year remained a difficult one for the hong kong economy generally.
we regard it of paramount importance that we keep a clear focus amidst the challenging environment. our goal is to continue investing in areas which will enhance our asset value and underlying competitiveness. as a property investment company, we look clearly beyond leasing as our key activity.
our objective is asset management: we constantly ask ourselves how to put our properties to the highest and best use. this involves developing a building, leasing, managing as well as servicing it; and most important of all, constantly reviewing and assessing it within its particular market segment, and following up with appropriate enhancement programmes including market repositioning and upgrades.
in addition to having achieved strong occupancy rates, we have further enhanced the asset value of our portfolio during the year. we completed the market repositioning of our bamboo grove residential property, which was well-received by the market. upgrades have been completed for some of our other we further improved our property service levels and our operating our balance sheet remains strong with our maturity profile further details of these initiatives and the progress we made in implementing our strategic principles, are further discussed in the operating and financial review on pages 4 to 10.
