the results of 2015 demonstrated the complementary nature of the trust s property portfolio. the continued growth in the income from langham place largely offset the decline in income at citibank plaza, where the occupancy was being ramped up. in fact the leasing of citibank plaza has been successfully turned around during 2015, with a sharply higher level of leasing commitments. as the new lease signings gradually translated into actual occupancy in the latter part of 2015 and early part of 2016, coupled with higher rental rates, the property should bring significant income growth to the reit in the coming year.
total rental income of the trust for 2015 was hk$2,062.7 million, slightly down from hk$2,080.2 million for 2014. the growth in income from langham place has compensated for the drop at citibank plaza. with occupancy of citibank plaza significantly increased to 91.2% as at 31 december 2015 from 75.4% as at 31 december 2014, rental income from the property had bottomed out in the second half of 2015.
net operating expenses declined slightly by 0.3% to hk$279.0 million. the savings in net building management expenses and rental commission at langham place have offset the higher rental commission and repairs and maintenance expenses in citibank plaza. net property income went down marginally by 0.9% to hk$1,783.6 million (2014: hk$1,800.4 million). profit after tax for 2015 recorded an increase of 71.4% to hk$3,305.0 million (2014: hk$1,928.6 million), primarily driven by the increase in fair value of investment properties of hk$2,278.5 million, compared with an increase of hk$889.9 million in for the second half of 2015, total rental income of the trust increased by 6.1% compared with the first half, mainly the result of the bottoming out of rental income of citibank plaza, which increased by 8.3% half-on-half to hk$502.4 million (1h15: hk$464.0 million).
similarly, net property income had also bottomed out in the second half at hk$905.6 million, 3.1% higher than the first half.
total distributable income for full year 2015 amounted to hk$1,212.1 million, decreasing by 1.8% compared with hk$1,234.4 million in 2014, mainly due to a transitory decrease in net property income and higher cash finance expenses. factoring in the hk$61.2 million of distributable income retained from the interim period, distribution amount for the year would be hk$1,145.9 million, 2.1% lower than 2014.
final distribution per unit ( dpu ) would be hk$0.1031. together with the interim dpu of hk$0.0954 paid, total dpu for 2015 would be hk$0.1985, a decline of 2.5% compared with 2014.
the appraised value of the trust s properties was hk$64,783.0 million as at 31 december 2015, an increase of 3.8% compared with hk$62,438.0 million as at 31 december 2014, mainly driven by higher rental assumptions. the rise in office rental of citibank plaza has been more than sufficient to counterbalance the impact of capitalization rate expansion. as a result, net asset value per unit was hk$8.40 as at 31 december 2015, increasing by 4.2% compared with hk$8.06 as at 31 december 2014.
the increase in asset valuation has also contributed to the decrease in gearing ratio from 23.1% as at 31 december 2014 to 22.1% as at 31 on 24 february 2016, credit rating agency moody s assigned an investment-grade baa1 issuer rating to champion reit. this will supplement the solid support that we have all along been receiving from the commercial banks and should open up more opportunities in the debt capital market for cost- effective financing to diversify our during the financial year, the trust has invested in investment grade bonds to enhance the yield on funds that had previously been placed in bank deposits earning minimal interest. total carrying amount of notes receivables amounted to hk$223.2 million as at 31 december 2015.
we expect the trust to resume the growth in distributable income in 2016. the significant progress in leasing up of citibank plaza, together with higher achieved rents, will be a key growth driver.
positive rental reversion at langham place office should also bring modest gains in income, while the contribution from langham place mall should be stable.
