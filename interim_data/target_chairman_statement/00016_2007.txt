the group completed six projects in hong kong consisting of 4.4 million square feet of attributable floor area during the year, of which 2.9 million square feet are residential properties for sale. virtually all the residential units completed during the year have been sold, except for the cullinan at kowloon station, which will go on sale in the next few 
ten sites were added to the groups land bank in hong kong during the year, through agricultural land conversions, government auctions, public tenders and private negotiations.
the total developable gross floor area is 5.5 million square feet, of which 4.1 million square feet will be for residential use.
the groups hong kong land bank amounted to 43.5 million square feet of gross floor area as at 30 june 2007, consisting of 23.9 million square feet of completed investment properties and 19.6 million square feet of properties under development. the group also holds more than 23 million square feet of agricultural land in terms of site area. most of this is along existing or planned railways in the new territories and is in the process of land use conversion. the group will continue replenishing its development land bank through various means when appropriate opportunities arise.

the group made significant progress in land acquisitions on the mainland during the year, adding four new sites to its development land bank. three are in guangzhou with an aggregate attributable gross floor area of 15.6 million square feet and one is in chengdu, in which the group has a 91 per cent interest with an attributable gross floor area of six million 
the groups mainland land bank was an attributable 45.8 million square feet as at 30 june 2007. of the 42.8 million square feet of properties under development, 33.3 million will be high-end residences, while the remainder will be top-grade offices, shopping malls and premium hotels. another three million square feet of completed investment properties, mainly offices and shopping centres in prime locations, are being held as long-term 
the overall residential market in hong kong fared better with higher transaction volume, increased prices and reduced inventory levels in the past few months. market confidence strengthened further amid rising incomes and a strong job market. high affordability and low mortgage interest also supported demand. there were fewer new projects available in the market for pre-sale during the year. the profile of homebuyers diversified, with more up-graders and investors.
demand in the luxury segment was particularly strong as a result of abundant liquidity and higher equity prices. new supply was also limited, so prices for luxury residential properties outperformed the mass market during the period under review.
the encouraging sales results for manhattan hill, the vineyard and harbour green once again demonstrated the groups superb quality, market leadership and strong brand.
efficient layouts, luxurious clubhouses and appealing lifestyle concepts set the groups 
the group was the first in the industry to offer a one-year guarantee on new residential developments ten years ago, and it is again taking the lead by extending the guarantee to two years. this shows the groups commitment to and confidence in the quality of its developments. the group will continue reinforcing its brand name for quality, upgrading new developments and innovating to meet the evolving needs and aspirations of homebuyers.

the groups gross rental income, including its share from joint-venture investment properties, rose by 11.6 per cent over last year to hk$7,215 million. net rental income was hk$5,245 million, an increase of 13.7 per cent over the previous year. occupancy of the groups rental portfolio remains high at 94 percent.
overall rental income growth was primarily driven by increased rents for new leases and renewals for all types of property, with better growth from offices in core areas where the booming financial sector sought space for further expansion. the groups diverse office portfolio performed well in this positive environment. renovations during the year added to the competitiveness of the groups portfolio, and new office projects to be completed over the next four years will further boost rental income.
the key office project under development is international commerce centre. it is destined to be both a landmark and a prestigious business address, and will be the tallest building in hong kong when completed in 2010. the project is conveniently located above kowloon station on the airport express, with easy access to central and the airport, as well as the mainland via planned cross-border rail connections. it will incorporate a comprehensive range of facilities including hotels operated by ritz-carlton and w-hotels and the stylish 900,000-square-foot elements shopping mall set to open soon.
pre-leasing of the international commerce centre office space is very encouraging. morgan stanley will become the anchor tenant in the first phase, occupying ten floors. it will relocate its asia pacific head office from central to international commerce centre in late 2008. this will be the first time that an investment bank has moved its headquarters to kowloon. virtually all the 900,000 square feet of office space in the first phase is pre-leased or at an advanced stage of negotiations. prospective tenants include financial institutions, professional firms, multinational companies and china-hong kong businesses.
pre-leasing of the second phase of 600,000 square feet to be completed in mid 2009 has 
other office projects under construction in various locations will set new area benchmarks for premium quality. pre-leasing of millennium city phase 6 in east kowloon is progressing as planned. the group is also developing a large office project on kwai chung town lot 215.
construction of the first phase of 600,000 square feet is under way. these projects together with international commerce centre will cement the groups position as one of the largest grade-a office landlords in hong kong.
the local retail sector continued to do well and the groups shopping centres attracted more visitors, benefiting retail tenants with growth in traffic and sales. both the apm and ifc malls are fully let, and their success has reinforced the groups leading position in the retail 
the group will ensure that its shopping malls remain attractive with regular renovations, promotional campaigns and refinements to tenant mixes. world trade centre has been one of the most popular shopping malls in causeway bay. renovations are under way to increase the retail area from 160,000 to 280,000 square feet, with nine office floors being converted to retail use. both landmark north and tsuen wan plaza are also undergoing renovations and tenant mix changes, which will give the malls fresh new looks and offer more comfortable environments for shoppers.

the mainland economy continued to grow rapidly over the past year. the inflow of foreign investment continued amid an appreciating renminbi exchange rate. the demand for housing has been growing among end users as people become more affluent and look to fill their greater need for accommodation, while ample liquidity is fuelling property investment.
the current macro-control measures aimed specifically at the property sector should be conducive to sustainable and healthy development in the property market over the long term.
the groups mainland investments remain focused on prime cities including beijing, shanghai and guangzhou, as well as other selected major cities. the balanced model between property sales and rental income in hong kong is being followed on the mainland where both residential projects for sale and landmark commercial properties for rent are 
applying its hong kong expertise and experience, the group has started to build its brand name by developing landmark projects in major mainland cities. the entire four-million-plus square foot shanghai ifc project in lujiazui feet will be finished by 2010.
the first phase with 900,000 square feet of premium offices, one million square feet of retail space and a half-million-square-foot w-hotel will be finished in 2009. the office towers are being built according to the latest international standards and specifications, catering to the sophisticated needs of multinational companies and world-class financial institutions.
office leasing enquiries from multinationals and top retailers seeking retail space have been encouraging. hsbc will be a major occupant of the south office tower upon its completion.
construction of another major development on shanghais huai hai zhong road is under way. this is in the heart of the busiest downtown area and will have 2.5 million square feet of top-quality retail space, offices and deluxe residences. the 1.2-million-square-foot shopping mall is destined to be a new focal point in the heart of shanghai. the group is also developing a 1.7-million-square-foot luxury waterfront residential project in wei fong that will be the epitome of luxury living in shanghai.
the groups joint venture projects in wuxi and hangzhou are progressing as scheduled.
the first release of nearly 300 units in the taihu international community in wuxi went on sale in june this year and all were sold within a few hours. the pre-sale of approximately one million square feet of luxury residences in the first phase of hangzhou mixc is set to start in mid 2008. the group has 40 per cent stakes in both projects.
the groups mainland rental portfolio continued to produce good results. shanghai central plaza remained fully let during the year at increased retail and office rents. the major revamp of the one-million-square-foot beijing apm is ongoing and will be finished by the end of this year, in time to take advantage of opportunities offered by the 2008 beijing olympics. the renovated mall will be a stylish shopping destination for high-spending customers, with more international retailers like the new nike megastore and additional food and beverage outlets. major renovations to the 460,000 square feet of office space are in 
the steady increase in tourists and business travellers coming to hong kong was beneficial to the groups four seasons, royal garden, royal park and royal plaza hotels. they recorded an impressive average occupancy of 89 per cent and significant room rate increases during the year. the rooms and restaurants in the royal garden, royal park and royal plaza were upgraded to sustain high occupancy and competitiveness. the royal view hotel on the ting kau waterfront opened in june 2007 and has seen steadily-increasing business.
the year ahead is expected to be very good for tourism with the 2008 olympic games, and expanding business opportunities on the mainland and in hong kong are likely to boost the number of business travellers further. the group is well positioned to capitalize on these opportunities with new hotels under development. the kowloon station development will include two first-class hotels operated by w-hotels and ritz-carlton. the group is also developing premium hotels as part of its shanghai ifc project, again to be operated by w-hotels and ritz-carlton.
telecommunications and information technology

smartone registered a continued increase in service revenue and encouraging growth in operating profit. with a strong focus on delivering a superior customer experience, the company has established its position as the premier mobile operator in hong kong.
leading the way in network performance, service innovation as well as customer service, the company continues to improve its customer profile, reflected in the increase in arpu and data revenue, under very competitive market conditions. the group is confident in smartones prospects and will maintain its interest in the company as long-term strategic 
sunevision saw further revenue growth in the period under review. iadvantage continued to strengthen its leading position in carrier-neutral data centre facilities and service in hong kong and on the mainland, achieving solid improvements in occupancy. sunevisions financial position remained strong and the group is confident in the companys prospects.
transportation and infrastructure
transport international holdings
transport international holdings limited (tih) faced a challenging operating environment in hong kong, with wage increases, high fuel prices and intense competition from the railways exerting pressure on its franchised bus operations. tihs bus operations on the mainland have recorded growth in ridership, but have been affected by high fuel prices and inflation.
the company will continue to explore new investment opportunities given the positive long-term outlook for the mainland market. good sales of the manhattan hill residential flats in west kowloon have enhanced the companys financial position. tih also owns 73 per cent of roadshow holdings limited, which is mainly engaged in media sales in hong kong and on the mainland.
other infrastructure businesses
the wilson group reported satisfactory results, while route 3 (cps) traffic volume remained steady throughout the year. both the airport freight forwarding centre and the river trade terminal continued to operate smoothly. all the groups infrastructure projects are in hong kong and are expected to generate healthy cash flows and returns over the long term.

the group remains committed to prudent financial management and maintaining low leverage. higher cash flows from rental income and property sales kept it in a strong financial position with the net debt to shareholders funds ratio standing at 14 per cent as at 30 june 2007.
a hk$15,250 million six-year, fully-revolving syndicated loan facility was arranged in june 2007, in line with the groups policy of lengthening its debt maturity profile and ensuring adequate committed facilities for expansion. the group also issued a ten-year us$300 million bond under its euro medium term note programme in march 2007. the group will continue to source long-term financing at competitive rates as and when appropriate.
the group has not made any speculative arrangements with derivatives or structured products including collateralized debt obligations. its exposure to foreign exchange risk is minimal, as the great majority of its financing is denominated in hong kong dollars. the groups robust financial condition and leading market position have earned it an a1 rating with a stable outlook from moodys and an a rating with a stable outlook from standard & poors. these are the highest credit ratings among hong kong developers.

quality and service are the groups hallmarks, and it never ceases its efforts to raise standards even higher. its property-management subsidiaries hong yip and kai shing provide occupants of the groups residential estates the finest customer care. the groups extended two-year guarantee shows its confidence in the quality of its developments and a commitment to offering homebuyers the very best.
the group is committed to protecting the environment. hong yip and kai shing employ green practices in the estates they manage, and the companies efforts to work with tenants to achieve a greener environment have earned numerous accolades for customer service and 
the group reaches out to the community through the shkp club, as part of its dedication to building homes with heart. the club actively promotes domestic harmony in various ways and offers its 260,000 members a variety of property-related offers and shopping privileges, as well as leisure and recreational activities. the clubs co-brand visa card also provides members with a broad spectrum of discounts and services.

maintaining high standards of corporate governance is a cornerstone of the groups business philosophy. this is achieved through an effective board of directors, timely disclosure of information and a proactive investor-relations programme.
the group has audit, remuneration and nomination committees in place to ensure adequate internal controls, and it will continue its efforts to stay at the forefront of best corporate 
the groups ongoing efforts and achievements in corporate governance have won widespread recognition and awards from the investment community. accolades during the year include number one rankings as the best company for corporate governance in hong kong and asia by asiamoney magazine and best property company in hong kong and asia by euromoney magazine. it was also crowned asias best real estate company by financeasia magazine and secured a place as the only developer to receive a best corporate governance award from the asset magazine.
corporate social responsibility
effective community involvement is also a priority for the group. it started the shkp book club two years ago to encourage reading and writing in hong kong, and the club has been very active in organizing book review competitions, helping new authors and putting out a free literary magazine. the group makes significant contributions to a wide variety of charitable organizations and supports education through direct funding and scholarships for deserving hong kong and mainland students at various levels. the group also promotes mental well being and positive living. its 1,200-strong shkp volunteer team devotes considerable time to helping needy people in the community.
senior management recognizes that staff are the groups most valuable asset. the group offers a broad range of training and development courses to help employees reach their full potential, both personally and professionally. the group also recruits top graduates from hong kong and mainland universities for its management trainee programmes, to ensure the continuity of its high-calibre management and corporate culture.

the global economy should continue to grow in the coming year, with steady expansion in most industrialized countries and robust growth in emerging markets despite the sub-prime lending problem and downward housing market adjustment in the us. recent global stock market volatility and tighter credit conditions could pose potential risks to the global economy, but strong economic growth is likely to continue on the mainland even though some macro-control measures and monetary tightening remain.
this year was the tenth anniversary of hong kongs reunification with the motherland. the successful implementation of the one-country, two-systems concept has helped boost confidence in the territorys future among foreign and domestic investors, while various sectors of hong kongs economy have risen to new heights over the last ten years. the central government continues to provide support to the territory with positive policies and initiatives such as the recent introduction of renminbi bonds in hong kong and the plan to allow individual mainland investors to purchase hong kong shares via specific channels.
all these factors reinforce hong kongs role as an international hub of business and finance.
the residential market in hong kong will continue to do well. accelerated income growth amid a tight labour market, continued low mortgage interest and the expectation of higher inflation are likely to drive greater demand for residential property. improved confidence and high affordability for homebuyers are also positive factors. on the supply side, significant inventory declines and low levels of new completion also point to further firming up of prices.
the group will continue adding to its hong kong land bank as opportunities arise through means such as farmland conversion. it will also keep adding value to new developments with sophisticated planning, better designs and layouts, comprehensive clubhouse facilities and top-quality finishes. the groups well-recognized brand name enhances marketability and development margins on new projects.
good performance is anticipated from the groups investment portfolio in hong kong, with higher rents for lease renewals and new tenants. grade-a office rents in core areas are likely to remain firm given the tight supply. retail rents should continue to rise modestly, thanks to healthy retail sales amid a better job market, rising incomes and growing tourist 
the group has over six million square feet of investment property now under development in hong kong. these new projects and others on the mainland will substantially raise the groups rental income over the medium to long term. the group will keep considering different options to enhance the composition of its investment property portfolio.
the mainland property market will continue to prosper in the years ahead in view of continued rapid economic growth and peoples increasing aspirations to home ownership.
the group added significantly to its mainland land bank last year and will continue to step up investment on the mainland. it is actively looking for new projects and will increase the proportion of its mainland committed investments from the current 17 per cent to 30 per cent of total assets in the medium term, at the same time as it continues building up its mainland team to cope with this business growth.
the groups mainland strategy will remain focused on four prime cities beijing, shanghai, guangzhou and shenzhen at the same time as it seeks investment opportunities in other major cities. the brand recognition achieved in hong kong will be replicated on the mainland with major commercial and residential developments targeting middle and high-end 
major residential projects to go on the market in the next nine months include the cullinan at kowloon station and harbour place and beacon lodge in kowloon. the remaining units in the first phases of taihu international community in wuxi and hangzhou mixc will also be offered for pre-sale. barring unforeseen circumstances, the results for the coming financial year are expected to be satisfactory.

i would also like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to my fellow directors for their guidance, and to thank all our staff for their dedication and hard work.
