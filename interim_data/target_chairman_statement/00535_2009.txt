chairman s statement lim ee seng acting chairman during the financial year ended 30 september 2009, the group realized a profit attributable to shareholders of hk$3.2 million (with a total revenue of hk$124.8 million) against hk$8.3 million profit (with a total revenue of hk$123.6 million) reported for the year ended 30 september 2008. with over 90% of its assets domiciled in mainland china and almost all its revenue earned therefrom, the group s revenue for the financial year ended 30 september 2009 was relatively stable, reflecting the continued strength of the mainland economy and its currency.
in an effort to mitigate the adverse impact of the unprecedented global financial turmoil, china moved swiftly to increase domestic spending by announcing a massive rmb4.1 trillion stimulus package in november 2008. in the first quarter of 2009, china recorded its lowest economic growth rate of 6.1% in almost a decade following years of annual double-digit growth since 2003. however, the economy rebounded strongly to 7.9% in the second quarter of 2009 and accelerated to 8.9% in the third quarter. china is now well-positioned to be the first major economy to recover from the global crisis. most analysts are predicting china s gdp growth at 8.3% for 2009, reaching or even surpassing 9% for 2010.
in tandem with the global economic downturn, china s real estate sector suffered across-the-board declines in prices and volumes transacted in the last quarter of 2008. however, by the beginning of 2009, some optimism had returned and a rebound in volumes transacted was perceptible as developers cut prices to entice buyers. housing prices in 70 of the mainland s large and medium-sized cities rose 2.8% year-on-year in september 2009, building on the 2% growth in august 2009, according to the national bureau of statistics. it was the highest and fourth consecutive increase after seven months of declines, providing further indication of an improvement in the real estate sector.

the group will continue to channel resources towards the optimal and cost-effective management of its existing portfolio of assets so as to maximize yields and shareholder value.

revenue for the year ended 30 september 2009 was hk$124.8 million, marginally higher than the hk$123.6 million realized for the previous year ended 30 september 2008. it is noteworthy that for the first time rental income from the two business park assets surpassed the hk$100 million mark. while sales revenue from the completed residential projects fell, rental income from the business parks rose to hk$117.4 million from last year s hk$85.5 million, boosted by the improving contribution from the leases of vsbp.
this rental growth reflects the group s improvement in its recurrent income stream and quality cashflows. the group will continue to enhance the income capacity of these business park assets in the long-term to maximize yield.
the after-tax profit attributable to equity holders recorded during the year under review fell 62% to hk$3.2 million from hk$8.3 million for the previous year ended 30 september 2008.

with phases 1 and 2 now offering a combined 125,000 sm of high quality space within seven office blocks, supported by a multi-storey car-park building and an amenity centre, amidst a landscaped park, vsbp has established itself as a location of choice in shenzhen for businesses which require a well- maintained and conducive physical environment backed by reliable property management services. as an affirmation of this reputation, phases 1 and 2 enjoyed consistently near full occupancy throughout the year. discussions with the shenzhen authorities on the future development plans for the phase 3 site have achieved much progress and it is hoped that an amicable settlement can be reached soon.
following the sale of the seven floors and naming right of the building to sohu.com in january 2007, the remaining space owned by the group s 60%-held subsidiary, vision huaqing (beijing) development co., ltd., in the renamed sohu.com internet plaza (sip) enjoyed an occupancy rate of over 95% during the year under review. sip has continued to maintain its enviable status as a landmark building and a sought-after address within the zhongguancun district in beijing.
the group continues to work closely with its joint venture partner, fcl china, in the planning, development and marketing process of the shanghai shanshui four seasons site. the construction of phase 1 comprising 418 semi-detached and terrace houses has been largely completed and is due to be handed over to purchasers from december 2009.

it is widely accepted that mainland china s economy has responded well to government pump-priming and easing of credit, resulting in increased domestic consumption. barring unforeseen circumstances, given china s sound economic fundamentals, the group believes that in the mid- to long-term, there will still be sustainable demand in all property sectors, such as office, residential, industrial parks and retail, in all major and secondary cities, both coastal and inland.

the group believes that a total commitment to good corporate conduct and governance is essential to the sustainability of its business and performance. the group monitors developments in governance practices both in hong kong and abroad and reviews the group s policies regularly with the view to enhance the governance process. where appropriate to safeguard the interests of the shareholders, lenders and other stakeholders, the group will go beyond regulatory compliance and be driven by principles rather than form.
