chairman s statement i hereby present to of the group for the year ended 31 december 2003 as the year 2003 was an extraordinary one with numerous challenges for shanghai industrial. the economic situation in the first half-year, both globally and in hong kong, remained depressed with the war in iraq and sars erupting. the economies of china and hong kong, and even business contacts between shanghai and hong kong, were dealt a severe blow. meanwhile, the group faced serious pressure to restructure its business with a need to resolve the issue of the guaranteed fixed-return projects in china, resulting in the market s concern over our future profits. the management team reacted positively and followed through determinedly its business transformation strategy, implementing several important operating and development initiatives during the year. we not only managed to overcome the difficulties in our operation but also achieved outstanding results that were well received in the market. both share price and market capitalisation rose substantially. in the latter half of 2003, the operating environment improved and the performance of existing businesses recorded good results. furthermore, the group s associated company, semiconductor manufacturing international corporation ( smic ), issued additional preference shares at a premium, bringing an exceptional profit of approximately hk$239.15 million to the group. as at 31 december 2003, the group recorded an audited consolidated profit of approximately hk$1,259.17 million for the year, a rise of approximately 11.8% compared to the previous year.
we saw a steady growth in business and overall operating performance was good.
the issue of guaranteed fixed return projects was settled properly after the prc state council announced in september 2002 that local governments must address the issue of guaranteed fixed return investment projects with foreign entities, the group began to explore a resolution with the relevant authorities. after many rounds of negotiation, an agreement was reached in late august 2003. the group disposed of its entire interests in the two elevated highway projects to the joint venture partners in china, and received full reimbursement of the carrying value of the investments plus after-tax compensation, totalling hk$5,762.33 million. the issue of elevated highway projects was thus fully settled.
the group seized the opportunity to restructure its infrastructure while disposing of the elevated highway projects, the group seized the opportunity to acquire the right to operate the shanghai-nanjing expressway (shanghai section) for 25 years, for a consideration of rmb2 billion. the group also collaborated with a subsidiary of the state enterprise china energy conservation investment corporation to form china water & sewage treatment company limited, to invest in and operate water services businesses in china. the shanghai-nanjing expressway is one of the busiest toll roads in the yangtze river delta and investing in this quality project will bring steady cash income for the group every year. meanwhile, mainland china has further opened public utilities markets to foreign enterprises.
water services projects have the characteristics of natural resources and possess enormous potential for market development. the group made a timely entrance into the water services market in the year. as the economy in china grows steadily, returns on highway and water services projects will enjoy continuous growth. profit contribution from the original elevated highway projects would have diminished annually due to amortization of their investment costs every year, whereas the new infrastructure investments will bring noticeable growth in profits to the group.
as at the end of 2003, the throughput of shanghai ports exceeded 11.28 million teus, representing an approximate 30% average annual growth. the shanghai container port has become the world s third largest. the group s joint venture company, shanghai pudong international container terminals limited, operates the phase i project of the shanghai waigaoqiao container port. since it commenced business on 1 march 2003, satisfactory growth was recorded in both income and throughput compared to the previous year. the group will continue to explore opportunities for increasing investment in port infrastructure in the future. the group s realignment of infrastructure projects is basically completed focusing on toll roads, water services and port facilities. the current business portfolio is of a high quality with growth the core business is being predominantly developed and the medical segment consolidated into a single investment and medicine and biotechnology has been a relatively fast-growing business in the group, and is also one of the core businesses being predominantly developed. this business segment entered into a new stage of development in 2003 with the implementation of two major reorganisation moves in the medical business segment. three listed companies in shanghai and hong kong were involved and total funds worth approximately hk$1,335.07 million. one of the moves was to acquire an approximate 56.63% interest in the a-share company shanghai industrial united holdings co., ltd. ( si united ), listed on the shanghai stock exchange, from the parent company and other independent third parties; and the other was to privatise siic medical science and technology (group) limited ( siic medtech ), listed on the gem board of the hong kong stock exchange. the acquisition of si united is now in its final stage of approval by the relevant prc government authorities, while siic medtech was officially withdrawn from listing on 17 september 2003. as a result of the restructuring, the medical businesses of the group and its parent company will be combined and focus on a single investment and operating platform incorporating chinese medicine, health food, biomedicine, chemical pharmaceuticals, medical equipment and medicine retails. this will make the business structure more focused, enhancing management efficiency and allowing better allocation of resources.
