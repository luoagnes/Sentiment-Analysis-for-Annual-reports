total volume of gas sales in hong kong for the year decreased slightly by 0.8 per cent compared with 2005. as at the end of 2006, the number of customers was 1,622,648, an increase of 25,375 over 2005.
introduction of natural gas to hong kong since october 2006, with the introduction of natural gas from the guangdong liquefied natural gas ( lng ) terminal to hong kong, the group has been using a dual naphtha and natural gas feedstock mix for the production of town gas.
the grand opening of the natural gas receiving station at tai po gas production plant was held in november 2006. the group has contracted to take natural gas at a price currently lower than naphtha which helps reduce production costs thus enhancing the competitiveness of the gas tariff.

in 2006, the group acquired its first coalbed gas joint venture project in shanxi province where the country s largest reserve of coalbed gas resources is located. as the components of coalbed gas are similar to those of natural gas, this can be developed as a major alternative source of energy to help alleviate the country s temporary energy shortages and environmental pollution. the group also concluded a joint venture agreement during the year to invest in a natural gas liquefaction project in yan an, shaanxi province. this project will provide an additional gas source for piped in 2006, the group signed agreements to establish piped city-gas companies in xi an, shaanxi province; yuhang, hangzhou, zhejiang province; tongling, anhui province; jintan, jiangsu province and yingkou, liaoning province. inclusive of panva gas, the group now has 60 piped city-gas projects in mainland cities across eastern, central, northern, northeastern, western and southwestern china as well as in guangdong and shandong provinces. the joint ventures gradual conversion to natural gas has boosted demand for this fuel.
the group s investment and operation of upstream projects will help provide new gas sources for these piped city-gas projects. since the implementation of the state plan of transmitting natural gas from sichuan province to eastern china and shandong province, and an increase in the quantity of imported lng, the group s mainland projects are projected to thrive within the next three years.
the group s high-pressure natural gas pipeline joint ventures in anhui province, hebei province and hangzhou, zhejiang province continue to operate smoothly.
this kind of midstream investment underpins downstream joint venture projects which enable the group to strengthen its piped city-gas market interests. the group is also developing other natural gas-related businesses such as natural gas filling stations for automobiles and supply of lng for heavy duty trucks.
since entry into the water supply and wastewater business sector on the mainland in 2005, the group has been operating water supply projects in wujiang, jiangsu province and in wuhu, anhui province, and managing an integrated water supply and wastewater joint venture in suzhou industrial park, suzhou, jiangsu province. increasing economic prosperity and expansion of population are boosting demand for clean water sources. the central government is opening up the water utility market, thus expanding business opportunities in this sector.

construction work of a 19 km pipeline to tai po gas production plant has also been completed.
the plant expects to start using the treated landfill gas to partially replace naphtha as a fuel for town gas production by mid-2007. using landfill gas effectively will help limit depletion of oil resources and reduce air pollution, thereby further contributing to the group s commitment to protect the eco s liquefied petroleum gas filling station business is progressing well.
with recovery in the domestic economy during the year, eco achieved growth in turnover.

the company anticipates an increase of about 25,000 new customers and a slight growth in gas sales volume in hong kong during 2007. the group s mainland business is expected to further prosper given that the total number of piped city-gas projects has increased since the acquisition of panva gas as its associated company in early march 2007.
the board of directors anticipates a satisfactory development for the group s overall businesses in 2007.
