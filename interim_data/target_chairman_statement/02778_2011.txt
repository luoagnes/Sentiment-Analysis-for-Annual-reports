chairman s report to unitholders my fellow unitholders, on behalf of the board i am pleased to present champion reit s annual report for the financial year ended 31 december 2010.
the 2010 financial results of champion reit largely reflect the lagged impact of the global financial crisis of 200809. this is a feature of property portfolios such as champion reit s, where three year lease terms are typical. as there were negligible tenant defaults through the crisis, the momentum of high rents of leases signed before the crisis continued to support occupancy at citibank plaza as well as revenue for the trust going into 2009. in fact revenue and net property income only peaked as recently as 2009, at the same time capital markets around the globe were hitting new lows. by the same token, the downsizing decisions made by tenants during the crisis led to significantly higher vacancies at citibank plaza in 2010, which marked the trough of the income cycle for the trust, even as market occupancies and rental rates were recovering strongly.
as there was a strong rise in transacted prices of commercial properties in the market in 2010, the value of the trust s property assets now stand at hk$50.2 billion, an increase of hk$6.0 billion from a year ago. net asset value increased correspondingly to hk$6.36 per unit, from hk$5.67 a year ago. as a result of increases in the appraised value of the trust s properties, the gearing ratio as of 31 december 2010 improved further to 28.4% from 32.2% a year ago.
net accounting gains of hk$4,055 million from the revaluation of assets and liabilities allowed the net profit after tax to increase to hk$4,440 million for 2010.
excluding these revaluation gains, which are non-cash in nature, distributable income for the year was hk$1,084 million, down 17.4% from 2009. the distribution amount for the year, after retention of hk$56.8 million for future use, was hk$1,066.9 million, representing a pay-out ratio of 94.8%. this was a 14.1% decrease from the distribution amount for 2009. the distribution per unit (dpu) for 2010 will be hk$0.2164, comprising hk$0.1076 per unit already paid out as an interim distribution, and hk$0.1088 per unit to be paid out as the final distribution.
debt with a principal amount of hk$7,765 million secured on the citibank plaza property, which had an appraised value of hk$33,747 million, is due for refinancing in may 2011. we are in the process of evaluating refinancing proposals. given the low loan-to-value ratio of 23%, and based on the responses from bankers, we do not expect any major problems with the refinancing. hk$765 million of the hk$7,765 million debt is in the form of convertible bonds, and if these are exercised before their maturity, the trust has sufficient internal resources to completely settle the conversions in cash if desired.
champion reit s revenue for 2011 is likely to show an improvement over 2010. at the operational level, all evidence points to a recovery at citibank plaza and further gains at the langham place mall. however, whether improvements at the property level translate into higher distributions will depend on a number of other factors, including the level of interest rate expenses upon debt refinancing. we will continue to prudently and pragmatically manage the trust to maximize long-term return for our unitholders.
