growing business amidst a competitive gaming climate worldwide tourist arrivals for 2010 grew by 6.7% compared to 2009 (source: world tourism organisation). comparatively, tourism in cambodia increased by approximately 16% to 2.5 million visitors during 2010 compared to 2009 (source: cambodia ministry of tourism). sustained tourist arrivals in cambodia, along with a stable political environment, have enabled the group to continue penetrating into the mass gaming market and delivering on its business remodeling strategy. this remodeling has focused on a shift in our business mix and has meant more build-up of our public fl oors and gaming machines, driven by market demand. at the same time, we have maintained a prudent, conservative approach on our junket segment where margins are relatively thin due to commissions payable to junket operators.
we believe that this is the right strategy going forward and that there is favorable growth opportunity in the markets we have penetrated so far. other target markets are also quickly becoming attractive for us.
within a competitive and burgeoning gaming climate throughout the asia pacifi c region, nagaworld s performance has kept pace with the robust levels of intra-regional travel and consumer spending which is stimulating steady growth in gaming revenue. financial indicators have noted nagaworld s tan sri dr chen lip keong ceo

for the year ended 31 december 2010, revenue derived from non-junket business contributed 64% of the total revenue compared to 55% in 2009. this improvement on non-junket revenue has provided the group with more stable revenue and higher margins, as well as an overall improved business mix.

chairman & ceo s statement (cont d) during the year, we surpassed our revenue goals, achieving 73% increase in net profi t compared to the same period last year. we achieved these results by staying focused on a remodeled strategy of building-up our public fl oor and gaming machines business, driven by market demand.
this has resulted in a healthier and more effi cient business mix, and has also produced lower earnings volatility for the group. during this period, 64% of our total revenues were derived from these segments, compared to 55% for the same period in 2009.
we believe that our business remodeling strategy is the right direction going forward. the results from our public fl oor and gaming machines business have been achieved in parallel with maintaining a prudent, conservative approach on our junket business, where margins are relatively thin due to commissions payable to junket operators. this remodeling is part of an evolutionary process for nagacorp and we feel positive about where it is taking us.
we believe that our integrated marketing strategy will continue to generate consistent results in the public fl oor and gaming machines segment of our business. our marketing initiatives are positioned to pursue market opportunities as they our junket business continues to be an important component of our business model. after installing a conservative credit policy and relatively low table limit in 2009, and going through an adjustment period as a result of those changes, we are pleased to see our junket fl oor business making progress.
the positive growth levels in this segment of our business occurred in conjunction with credit policies that grant limited credit lines to certain junket operators under strict guidelines and supervision, as well as efforts to encourage wagering on as we continue to push forward with our strategy of maintaining a conservative gaming policy aimed at regional mid-size players, and fostering relationships with key junket operators, we believe that we are on a positive trajectory toward steady growth in our junket fl oor business. our focus is on sustaining our junket business on our terms, which includes a conservative credit policy and relatively low table limit.
this business remodeling is part of our strategic focus on building sustainable, predictable results for tourist arrivals to cambodia during 2010 represented an increase of approximately 16% to 2.5 million visitors. the majority of these visitors who come to phnom penh also visit nagaworld, making our hotel and entertainment complex one of the most visited sites in the kingdom of cambodia. we work with various local, regional and worldwide travel and tour professionals to bring tour groups to nagaworld, reinforcing our status as a popular tourist destination. we believe that as long as the country s tourist numbers continue to increase, the number of visitors to nagaworld will increase proportionately. this important component of our daily foot traffi c is also a key in growing our mass our strategic priorities for 2011 are " higher earnings pushing for greater regional gaming market share through providing innovative mass market appeal, as well as " earnings stability lowering daily earnings fl uctuations by maintaining popular and reasonable table limits and higher business volume from the mass " cost control and improving margins effi cient and yet competitive commissions to operators, along with higher business volume from the mass market, where no commissions " continuing to maintain a solid cash position gaming on cash terms only. achieving these priorities and continuing on our positive trajectory will require focus and tenacity. specifi cally, 1) continue driving our mass market growth by tapping into economically burgeoning markets through focused marketing initiatives, and adding additional slots and gaming tables as appropriate.
