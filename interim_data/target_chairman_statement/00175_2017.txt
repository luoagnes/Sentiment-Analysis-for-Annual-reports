we further consolidated our leading position in chinas indigenous brand sedan segment in 2016 as a result of the good sales performance for our existing and new a-segment sedan models. the launch of two highly successful new midsize suv models geely boyue () and vision suv during the year, significantly increased our market share in chinas suv market. as a result, we achieved a respectful 53.6% growth in domestic sales volume in 2016. such strong sales volume growth in 2016 was also supported by our enhanced sales and marketing system in china. as a result of our strategy of taking a more conservative approach to contain financial risks in the export markets, our groups export sales volume posted a 15.4% yoy decline in 2016.
our group sold a total of 765,970 units of vehicles in 2016, up 50.2% from 2015, of which 744,191 units were sold domestically, up 53.6% from 2015. the remaining 21,779 units or 2.8% of total sales volume were sold abroad, down 15.4% from 2015. our five most popular models in 2016 included new emgrand, vision (and its successor new vision), geely boyue (), geely kingkong and emgrand gs, which together accounted for 79.9% of our groups total sales volume in 2016.

our groups financial performance in 2016 surpassed the managements expectations with total revenue increased by 78.3% to rmb53.72 billion for the year ended 31 december 2016 as strong domestic sales volume growth more than offset the weaker exports. the mid-size a-segment sedan model new emgrand remained our groups most popular model in terms of sales volume, accounting for 30.1% of our total sales volume in 2016. during the year, our groups average ex-factory selling price (asp) continued to improve, mainly driven by the improvement in product mix (i.e.
higher proportion of higher-priced models). total net profit of our group grew 125.9% from rmb2.29 billion in 2015 to rmb5.17 billion in 2016 due to the increase in overall sales volume, higher asp and stable profit margin during the year.

in view of the strong operational cash inflow in 2016 and the current high cash level, our board of directors decided to increase our dividend payout ratio and recommends the payment of a final dividend of hk$12 cents (2015: hk$3.8 cents) per share for 2016.

2016 was a prominent year in our evolution into the new geely era () as an innovative, well-respected brand. i have no doubt that the successful implementation of these initiatives will lead our group to become a much stronger automobile group.
the technological cooperation between our group and volvo car corporation, which is majority-owned by our groups parent, zhejiang geely holding group company limited () (geely holding), has achieved remarkable progress in the development of compact modular architecture (cma) platform during the year, which could enable our group to further optimize resources utilization, and speed up the implementation of platform strategy, standardization, shared modularization, digitalization, electrification and connectivity in product development so as to better cater our customers increasing demand and equip ourselves with strong and unique advantages over our competitors. i am confident that the huge benefits of synergy, technologies enhancement, product quality and brand image from the cooperation would become increasingly obvious in the coming years, thus boding well for our groups competitive strength in the areas of technology, quality and brand. further, our group plans to launch the first batch of new models built from cma platform, which is jointly developed by geely holding and volvo car corporation, under a new lynk&co brand in 2017. the cma platform, the new lynk&co brand, and its new business model are key parts of our groups strategy to expand our groups sales beyond the china market, to improve our groups competitiveness against major international brands and thus to sustain longer-term growth.
i firmly believe that our group is on the right track to achieve the goal of becoming a leading global automobile group, targeting to reach the total sales volume of 2 million units by year 2020 with good reputation and integrity, winning respects from our customers. finally, i would like to pay tribute to all our staff for their hard work and achievements during 2016 and to our shareholders for their continued
