while 2016 was a challenging year full of financial and political uncertainties, the group has performed well and delivered satisfactory results on multiple fronts. on expansions, apart from the closing of the acquisition of a hotel site in tokyo, the group has successfully acquired a site in downtown seattle, u.s. for us$18 million in december 2016. the site is located in the heart of seattles city centre and close to the famous historic pike place market. the site has an area of approximately 19,400 sq. ft. and has already been approved for the development of a 17-storey hotel.
however, we shall explore other available options to further enhance the development of this site. these acquisitions are supported by their undemanding valuations and were part of the groups long term strategy to expand in strategic gateway cities that will anchor our hotel brand as well as residential and office 
on divestments, as the asset manager of the u.s. fund (fund), we took advantage of a strong office market in san francisco, and have disposed of the funds three office buildings in and around san francisco in 2016. this has resulted in a distribution income from the fund of hk$280.6 million attributable to our interest in the fund for the year. in addition, the group booked a disposal gain in relation to the deferred profit made when we transfer the office buildings to the fund in 2014. these one-off gains were the drivers that boosted the groups core profit in 2016. other than acting on behalf of the fund, the group has also disposed of its remaining office building in the u.s., namely 2700 ygnacio located on the far outskirts of san francisco, for us$15 million in late 2016. therefore, the realised gain on disposal of u.s. properties amounted to hk$398.2 million in 2016 comprised of the deferred gain on the transfer of our office buildings to the fund, as well as a loss generated from the sale of 2700 ygnacio.
as for the groups results in 2016, the core operating income increased by 29.8% to hk$2,943.9 million in 2016 (2015: hk$2,268.0 million) as the u.s. fund declared its first distribution and as improvements were seen across the groups businesses. distribution income from champion reit rose by 22% to hk$871.6 million in 2016, mainly attributable to the higher occupancy at three garden road and, to a lesser extent, our increased holdings in the reit.
ebitda of the hotels division increased by 21.4% to hk$720.6 million, which was driven primarily by the improved revenue and margin expansion of the north american hotels despite currency drop in australia, new zealand, canada, united kingdom
and china where we own hotels. besides, distribution from lhi recorded a growth of 9.1% and amounted to hk$300.8 million in 2016, as a result of both improved performance of the hong kong hotels and we had our increased holdings in lhi.
administration expenses increased by 10.5% to hk$372.6 million in 2016 (2015: hk$337.2 million), mostly attributable to the increased headcount mainly for the project management and development team as the group carried out more development projects.
other income included a gain amounting to hk$7.5 million resulted from the selling of all of the hedging contracts against the japanese yen. these contracts were originally entered into in early 2016 to hedge our cash payment for the tokyo hotel project later that year. the hedge was unnecessary after we have successfully secured a loan with a low interest rate for the payments. subsequently, we managed to sell the contracts for a profit after the yen had depreciated towards the end of the year. however, other income of the group still dropped by 76.4% to hk$62.3 million in 2016, since such income in 2015 included a disposal gain of an associate company and a large gain was booked from the sale of securities.
in 2016, the group has written off a non-core investment in a startup company in the u.s. this investment was relatively small to the groups overall asset base and we believed that this co-work club company, involving the sharing economy, should benefit from the exponentially accelerating demand in the future. however, given the remarkably high startup cost and as its liquidity position has deteriorated rapidly throughout 2016, we were of the view that this startup would fail as its cash shortfall widens, whereas rising interest rates will likely deter its access to new capital to fund the enlarging shortfall. such write off was reflected as impairment on loan receivables amounting to hk$199.1 million in 2016s results.
since our write off at year end 2016, the company has developed a rejuvenation plan which may provide the company with renewed business edge. as the company is offering attractive investment terms on new fund raised, we have decided to participate in the new offering with a small us$5 million (approximately hk$38.8 million) investment, and should have convertible rights to become the biggest shareholder of the company.
interest income of the group fell by 71.8% to hk$42.1 million in 2016, given the groups cash were mostly denominated in hong kong dollars in 2016, while a large portion of the groups cash in 2015 were denominated in renminbi that bore much higher deposit rates. interest expense dropped by 23.3% to hk$134.0 million in 2016 (2015: hk$174.8 million) as a result of both repayment of certain high interest bearing loans, and refinancing some loans with lower 
share of results of joint ventures in 2016 comprised of returns from our 50% interest in the dalian project and our investment in a residential development project in miami, u.s.. for the dalian project, while there was a development profit from the recognition of 220 apartments in 2016, such profit turned to a loss after providing for a disproportionate share of the estimated land appreciation tax, and therefore, this has resulted in a after-tax loss of hk$7.5 million for our interest in the project for the year. there was also a loss booked for the miami project in 2016. as the miami project was still at the pre-sales stage, the loss was predominately attributable to the marketing and administrative expenses incurred. in total, losses amounted to hk$20.2 million for our share of results of joint ventures in 2016.
although core profit was adversely affected by nonoperating items including lower other income, interest income and a one-off write-off, the declines were much more than offset by the booking of a disposal gain from the sale of the u.s. offices attributable to the group. after taking into account an approximately 40% tax on such disposal gain, profit after tax for the group rose by 13.8% to hk$2,031.9 million in 2016 (2015: hk$1,785.7 million), and profit attributable to equity holders rose by 13.6% to hk$2,022.5 million in 2016 (2015: hk$1,780.1 million).
revenue of the hotels division rose by 2.4% to hk$3,715.0 million in 2016. the increase was primarily driven by an increase in revenue of the hotels in north america, followed by the improved revenue of the hotels in australianew zealand. given the fixed cost nature of the hotel business, the ebitda of the hotels division recorded a much higher growth of 21.4% and rose to hk$720.6 million in 2016, and the growth was even higher at 25.4% before accounting for the translation losses from foreign currencies. it should be noted that the hotel in downtown washington, d.c., usa is still undergoing renovation and was closed 
in north america, the growth in ebitda was led by improvements in the revenue and ebitda margin of the chelsea hotel in toronto, the langham huntington, pasadena and the langham, chicago.
whereas the rev par growth of the pasadena and chicago hotels was driven by increases in room rates alone, the rev par of the toronto hotel was attributable to an increase in both occupancy and room rate, as its occupancy recovered in 2016 from a low level during the renovation works in 2015. the growth in ebitda of the toronto hotel was diminished by the modest 3.4% depreciation in the average exchange rate of the canadian dollar against the hong kong dollar in 2016.
performance of the boston hotel was steady in 2016 but the langham place, fifth avenue hotel in new york suffered a decline in revenue in 2016, which was attributable to the negative impact of the renovation works and challenging market conditions in new york.
total revenue of the hotels in north america increased by 6.3% in 2016, while the growth in ebitda was much higher at 59.8%.
ebitda of the hotels in australasia was lifted by the improved performance of the langham, auckland and the langham, sydney. the langham, auckland
witnessed an improvement in occupancy and room rate which contributed to drive ebitda growth as margin expands. the ebitda growth of the langham, sydney was mainly due to its turnaround, as the hotel incurred a substantial loss in 2015 when it was carrying out major renovation works.
in 2016, there was a minor decrease in the revenue and ebitda of the langham, london in local currency terms, which were mainly due to the negative impact of the renovation works. however, the decline in revenue and ebitda of the hotel was exacerbated by the adverse currency translation, given a 11.3% depreciation in the average exchange rate of the british pound in 2016.
in china, revenue growth of the langham, xintiandi in shanghai would have been even higher in 2016, but the replacement of business tax by value added tax in may 2016 has adversely affected the amount of revenue recognised by the hotel since then.
nonetheless, the improved underlying business momentum was reflected in the growth of the hotels ebitda, which grew at a faster rate in 2016. note that as the average exchange rate of the renminbi experienced a depreciation of 5.3% in the year, the growth in revenue was translated to a drop in revenue in hong kong dollar terms, whereas the growth in ebitda was also lowered in hong kong dollar terms.
besides, a small portion of the pre-opening expense amounting to hk$6.9 million related to the cordis, hongqiao, which is expected to open in the first half of 2017, has been included in the ebitda of the china 
ebitda of the hotels division also included hotel management fee income from pure managed hotels and any surplus or shortfall incurred by the group as the lessee of lhis hotels, which are included under the others breakdown of the hotels divisions ebitda.
there was an increase in hotel management fee income in 2016, as a one-off fee was received from two pipeline hotels. furthermore, as the performance of lhis hotels recovered, the shortfall the group has incurred as the lessee of lhi has dropped in 2016.
performances of the hong kong hotels below were extracted from the 2016 results announcement of lhi relating to the performance of the trust groups 
hong kong hotels
after the spinoff of the hong kong hotels, the financial returns on the groups 61.9% equity stake in the three hotels in hong kong were reflected through our investment in lhi, under the section investment 
the langham, hong kong
the langham, hong kong, recorded a 1.5% decline in rev par in 2016, which was rather moderate as compared with the 3.6% drop in its respective high tariff a hotel market (considered as 5-star rated hotels). the hotel benefitted from keen demand for its renovated rooms and was able to capture more travellers from mainland china. there was also growth in arrivals from other geographical regions, which all contributed to an improved occupancy for the hotel.
this was, however, offset by a decline of average room rate in 2016.
revenue from food and beverage (f&b) rose by 0.7% year-on-year in 2016, driven mainly by the stronger business growth at the tang court as a result of the prestigious michelin three-star rating awarded at the end of 2015. there was also revenue growth at the bostonian, which witnessed improved business after its renovation in july 2016 with revamped menus.
however, f&b revenue from banqueting business remained weak during 2016.
during 2016, the hotel achieved average occupancy of 87.7% on an average of 498 rooms (2015: 84.7% on an average of 457 rooms) and an average room rate of hk$2,092 (2015: hk$2,198).
cordis, hong kong
at cordis, hong kong, a year-on-year rev par decline of 4.5% was inferior to that of its respective high tariff a market. however, it was mostly due to the temporary negative impact from the protests which broke out in mongkok during the chinese new year in early 2016. rev par dropped by 18% year-on-year during february and march 2016 which dragged down the rev par for the full year in 2016. nevertheless, demand picked up after the protests and growth in arrivals across most major markets was seen in the reminder of the year.
revenue from f&b increased 4.1% year-on-year in 2016 which was mainly attributable to the improved revenue of the place, which underwent renovation during the first quarter of 2015. alibi also recorded a pick-up in business in 2016, offsetting an absence of income from the tokoro restaurant which was converted to back office since the beginning of 2016.
for the year 2016, the hotel achieved average occupancy of 89.8% on an average of 653 rooms (2015: 89.7% on an average of 620 rooms) and an average room rate of hk$1,653 (2015: hk$1,734).
eaton, hong kong
the eaton, hong kong recorded a 3.1% decline in rev par in 2016, which was more than the 2.0% decline witnessed in its respective high tariff b hotel market (considered as 4-star rated hotel). the underperformance was due to severe room rate competition from nearby hotels. however, with flexible room rates, the hotel witnessed growth in arrivals from all major geographical regions in 2016 with an increase of 6.1 percentage points in the occupancy of the hotel in 2016, which helped to offset the 9.2% decline in the average room rate.
revenue from f&b dropped by 8.6% year-on-year in 2016, which was mainly attributable to substantially lower banqueting revenue. however, it is worth noting that its chinese restaurant, yat tung heen, received the michelin one-star rating in november 2016, after which there was a strong pick-up in business in 
for the year 2016, the hotel achieved average occupancy of 95.6% (2015: 89.5%) and an average room rate of hk$992 (2015: hk$1,093).

the langham, london
the renovation of 109 rooms that started in november 2015 and throughout 2016 has negatively impacted the revenue of the hotel. the renovation was originally scheduled to be completed in the third quarter of 2016, but was eventually delayed to january 2017.
although with less room inventory, the hotel witnessed an increase in both occupancy and average room rate in 2016. the higher room rate achieved was a result of the hotels successful strategy to accommodate more high yielding retail and corporate travellers. revenue from f&b also rose in the year, which was attributable to an improvement in both restaurants and banqueting

the langham, boston
as business from the retail and group segments was weak in the year, the hotel targeted at travellers from the corporate segment, which helped the hotel to deliver an 8% increase in average room rate in 2016. nevertheless, the increase in demand from the corporate segment was not enough to fully offset the weaker demand from other segments, and the hotel witnessed a decline in occupancy in 2016. on the other hand, there was a moderate increase in revenue from f&b, given a pickup in catering demand and improved restaurant business. note that phased renovations of the hotels guestrooms will commence from february 2017.
for the year 2016, the hotel achieved average occupancy of 76.7% (2015: 84.0%) and an average room rate of us$295 (2015: us$273).

since the soft opening of the hotel in late 2013, the hotel has firmly established itself as one of the most luxurious hotels in chicago. it was awarded with a number of prestigious accolades in the lodging industry, which has helped the hotel to further raise its average room rate in 2016. with a steady mix of demand from both corporate and retail travellers, average room rate rose by 6% in 2016, whereas a small increase in occupancy was achieved. revenue from f&b rose by 6% in the year, which was primarily driven by the increased catering business in corporate meetings and conferences.
for the year 2016, the hotel achieved occupancy of 70.9% (2015: 69.9%) and an average room rate of us$372 (2015: us$352).
langham place, fifth avenue, new york
the performance of the hotel was impacted by the room renovation that took place from january to may 2016, as well as the intense competition arising from airbnb in the new york hotel market. nonetheless, the completion of the refurbishment of two of the suites has helped the hotel to capture demand from the higher-yielding travellers, and as a result, there was only a modest decline in average room rate in 2016. in view of the continued intense competition in the market for large size accommodations, some of the suites will be sub-divided to create an addition of 20 standard rooms. the adaption work will start in february 2017 with targeted completion in june 2017.
revenue from f&b for the hotel declined by 21% in 2016, due to a lower revenue contributed by the bar which was closed in april 2016, whereas catering business was impacted by noise disruption from the

total rental income of the mall increased by 3.4% to hk$817 million in 2016, compared with hk$790 million in 2015. passing base rents grew to hk$178.74 per sq. ft. (based on lettable area) as at 31 december 2016 compared with hk$174.54 per sq. ft. as at 31 december 2015. tenants sales in the mall reduced 4.9% year-on-year during 2016, narrowing from a 6.4% decline in the first half of the year and again outperforming the hong kong overall retail sales figures, which declined 8.1% in 2016.
however, the slowdown in tenants retail sales has negatively affected the turnover rent portion. turnover rent for 2016 declined to hk$86 million, compared with hk$92 million for 2015. net property income increased marginally by 1.8% to hk$692 million, compared with hk$680 million in 2015.
investment in lhi
on statutory accounting basis, our investment in lhi is classified as a subsidiary, and its results are consolidated into the groups statutory income statement. however, as lhi is principally focused on distributions, the groups core profit will be derived from the attributable distribution income after the impact of dividend waived, as we believe this will better reflect the financial return and economic interest attributable to our investment in lhi. this entry is also consistent with our practice in accounting for returns from our investment in champion reit, which also focuses on distributions.
in 2016, there was an increase in the hotels revenue as overnight arrivals to hong kong stabilises and there were more available rooms in lhis hotel portfolio after the renovations in 2015. furthermore, as the group has increased its holdings in lhi, these have resulted in a 9.1% year-on-year increase in distribution income from lhi. the distribution has already taken into account distribution entitlement in respect of our 100 million share stapled units held for 2016. the number of distribution waiver units will drop to 50 million share stapled units for the financial year 2017, and all of our holdings will be entitled to receive distribution payable from 2018 onwards.
it was a gesture by the group, as a major investor of lhi to waive part of its distributions so as to minimise dilution impact on initial yield to other investors. the dilution arose from additional units issued at the time of the initial public offering. the additional capital has been raised to fund asset enhancement initiatives on the initial portfolio, which should help support value of the properties of lhi going forward.
great eagle centre
the occupancy of the great eagle centre dropped from 98.2% as at the end of 2015 to 95.3% as at the end of 2016, as a majority of the incremental increase in available area are reserved for the groups in-house expansion, which will be occupied by the group since the first half of 2017. otherwise, occupancy of the great eagle centre would be stable as at the end of 2016 as compared with last year. meanwhile, spot rents at the great eagle centre rose from the midhk$60s per sq. ft. on lettable area as at the end of 2015 to around hk$70s per sq. ft. as at the end of 2016. as a result, there was a 2.2% growth in average passing rent for the leased office space at the great eagle centre, which increased from hk$64.8 per sq. ft. on lettable area as at 31 december 2015 to hk$66.2 per sq. ft. as at 31 december 2016.
overall gross rental income for the great eagle centre, which included retail rental income and other income, dropped by 2.6% to hk$139.6 million in 2016, which was mainly attributable to the absence of rental income after the expiry of a lease for a large signage space since late 2015. on the other hand, net rental income increased by 3.2% to hk$137.2 million in 2016 given a higher cost base for comparison in 2015, when additional maintenance capital expenditure was 
eaton serviced apartments
there was an increase in the overall occupancy of the three serviced apartments, which increased from 75.8% in 2015 to 78.8% in 2016. the increase was driven primarily by the improved occupancy of the serviced apartment at the village road property, which had a low level of occupancy in 2015 due to scaffolding and facelift works that negatively impacted demand. the wanchai gap road property also benefitted from the increased demand from the leisure segment which boosted its occupancy, while performance of the blue pool road property was negatively impacted by nearby competitions and achieved lower occupancy in 2016.
however, as competitions remain keen, average net passing rent for the three serviced apartments was only flat in 2016 and remained at hk$48.2 per sq. ft.
on gross floor area in 2016. gross rental income rose by 8.5% to hk$51.2 million in 2016, whereas net rental income increased by 10.8% to hk$31.7 million 
the u.s. fund
as part of the groups effort to expand our assetlight asset management business, the group has established a u.s. real estate fund in 2014, which targets at office and residential property investments in the united states. as at the end of 2016, the group held 49.97% interest in the u.s. fund and acts as the funds key asset manager with a 80% stake in the asset management company, and the remaining interest was held by china orient asset management (international) holding limited.
while the financials of the u.s. fund are consolidated into the groups financial statements under statutory accounting principles, the groups core profit is based on distribution received from the u.s. fund, as well as our share of asset management fee income from the u.s. fund. the groups core balance sheet is based on our share of net asset in the u.s. fund. since the establishment of the u.s. fund, other than properties transferred by the group which have been sold with a strong return in 2016, the u.s. fund had acquired several projects and updates of which are as follows.

the site, located at 1545 pine street, san francisco was acquired for us$21 million in january 2015.
the site is situated in the trendy polk street neighbourhood, in proximity to the traditional luxury residential areas of nob hill and pacific heights. the development with gross floor area of approximately 135,000 sq. ft. will comprise 100 studio and one- and two-bedroom residences. total investment cost for the project, including the us$21 million paid for the site, is expected to be approximately us$83 million.
construction work on the site has started in the first quarter of 2016 and the topping off of the building was celebrated in november 2016. the project is targeted for completion in the second half of 2017.
soft marketing on the sale of this condominium project has begun in the second quarter of 2016, and the project will be officially launched in early 2017.

the acquisition of the residential property in malibu, california was completed in september 2015 for us$62 million. the strategy is to reposition its 68 rental apartment units into high-end for-sale condominiums.
malibu is a sought-after high-end coastal residential area in los angeles, where regulatory development constraints establish high barriers to entry and currently no similar competing properties are available for sale or under development. renovation works has commenced since the second quarter of 2016 after vacant possession of all units had been taken. soft marketing on the sale of the apartment units has begun in the second quarter of 2016, whereas the formal launch of the project will be in the first half of 
the office building in seattle the u.s. fund had acquired is known as the dexter horton building, a historic building named after the founder of seattle first bank. it is a 15-storey building with a rentable floor area of 336,355 sq. ft. and is located at 710 second avenue in seattles central business district.
the building was acquired by the u.s. fund for us$124.5 million in september 2015.
in 2016, as the asset manager of the u.s. fund, we have sold the funds three office towers in san francisco for a very attractive return, and resulted in a distribution income from the u.s. fund of hk$280.6 million attributable to our interest in the fund in 2016. the group also booked a disposal gain to reflect the deferred profit when we transferred the office buildings to the u.s. fund in 2014. furthermore, the group booked hk$89.6 million (2015: hk$44.0 million) in asset and property fee income from the u.s.
fund, which was included under other operations in the groups operating income. the significant increase in asset and property fee income was due to the booking of a disposal fee income, which was based on the sale price of the disposed properties.

on statutory basis, after consolidating the results of champion reit, lhi and the u.s. fund, the consolidated net debts of the group as of 31 december 2016 was hk$21,589 million, an increase of hk$1,132 million compared to that as of 31 december 2015. the increase in reported net borrowings at the balance sheet date was mainly due to payment of a special dividend and new bank loans for financing the acquisition of a property in japan and development of a project in pak shek kok.
equity attributable to shareholders, based on professional valuation of the groups investment properties as of 31 december 2016 and the depreciated costs of the groups hotel properties (including hong kong hotel properties held by lhi), amounted to hk$55,847 million, representing an increase of hk$1,514 million compared to the value of hk$54,333 million as of 31 december 2015. the increase was mainly attributable to profit for the year, increase in share premium from additional shares issued under employee share option scheme and after offsetting by dividends paid out and exchange loss from translating foreign entities during the year.
for statutory accounts reporting purpose, on consolidation the group is treated as to include entire debts of champion reit, lhi and the u.s. fund.
based on the consolidated net debts attributable to the group (i.e only 65.50%, 61.90% and 49.97% of the net debts of champion reit, lhi and the u.s. fund respectively) and equity attributable to shareholders, the gearing ratio of the group as at 31 december 2016 was 24.9%. since the debts of these three subsidiary groups had no recourse to the group, we consider it is more meaningful to account for the groups own net debts instead of attributable consolidated net debts against the groups sharing of net assets of those subsidiaries, and the resulting net position is illustrated below.
the following analysis is based on the statutory consolidated financial statements: 
our gross debts (including medium term note) after consolidating champion reit, lhi and the u.s. fund amounted to hk$28,369 million as of 31 december 2016. foreign currency gross debts as of 31 december 2016 amounted to the equivalent of hk$8,897 million, of which the equivalent of hk$2,996 million or 34% was on fixed-rate basis.

the net consolidated finance cost including borrowing cost capitalised for property under development during the year was hk$598 million. overall interest cover at the reporting date was 5.6 times.
liquidity and debt maturity profile
as of 31 december 2016, our cash, bank deposits and undrawn loan facilities amounted to a total of hk$6,898 million. the majority of our loan facilities are secured by properties with sufficient value to loan coverage. the following is a profile of the maturity of our outstanding gross debts (including medium term note) as of 31 december 2016: within 1 year 8.8% 12 years 6.4% 35 years 71.0% over 5 years 13.8% pledge of assets
at 31 december 2016, properties of the group with a total carrying value of approximately hk$54,923 million (31 december 2015: hk$64,691 million), us dollars and hk dollars deposit with equivalent amount of hk$631 million (31 december 2015: hk$621 million) were mortgaged or pledged to secure credit facilities granted to its subsidiaries.
commitments and contingent liabilities
at 31 december 2016, the group has authorised capital expenditure for investment properties and property, plant and equipment which is not provided for in these consolidated financial statements amounting to hk$3,135 million (31 december 2015: hk$1,308 million) of which hk$442 million (31 december 2015: hk$292 million) has been 
at 31 december 2016, the group has outstanding financial commitment in respect of capital injection to a joint venture of rmb25.8 million (equivalent to hk$33 million) (31 december 2015: rmb25.8 million) and cash commitment to the china fund of us$46 million (equivalent to hk$357 million) (31 december 2015: us$46 million).
other than that, the group did not have any significant commitments and contingent liabilities at the end of the reporting period.

among the outcomes of major geopolitical events in 2016, it was the unexpected presidential election results in the u.s. that could set the stage for significant changes in the global economy in 2017.
if drastic changes in trade and foreign policies are pushed through in the u.s., they could have serious negative implications for global economic growth.
at the same time, we should not underestimate the adverse impacts arising from higher u.s. interest rates on the global economy as global financial conditions may tighten. other geopolitical events like the elections in eurozone, slightly uncertain china economy, and the middle east problems can also cause volatility in world markets and economic conditions. overall, macro conditions could become more challenging going forward, and we must stay vigilant and be ready to respond to any slowdown in 
as for the hotels division, the opening of the cordis hotel in hongqiao, shanghai in the first half of 2017 and the eaton hotel in washington d.c. in late 2017 will mark another key milestone in our long term plan to expand our global footprint and international brand recognition. however, the associated one-off pre-opening expenses will also be booked in 2017. in addition, renovations of different scale of the groups certain hotels will also have a negative impact on the ebitda of the overseas hotels division in 2017.
nonetheless, in the longer term we expect there will be further improvements in the ebitda of the ramped up and renovated hotels, which should help to offset much of the negative impact arising from the hotel renovations and the pre-opening expenses to be 
for hotels in hong kong, although rev pars of hong kongs hotels have largely stabilised in 2016, worrying signs including the recent strength of the hong kong dollar are emerging once again in 2017 which may affect demand for hotel rooms. for lhi, the phased refurbishment of the ballroom and dining area at the eaton, hong kong from mid-2017 will result in lower f&b and possibly room revenue in 2017. in addition, higher interest expense and cash tax payment due to depletion of tax loss carry forward will result in lower distributable income for lhi in 2017.
for champion reit, after achieving a respectable growth and a record high in distributable income in 2016, rental income growth momentum is expected to moderate in the coming year. at the property portfolio level, three garden road and langham place office should continue to deliver growth in 2017, however, langham place mall is expected to encounter downside risk in rental reversion. the overall rental income from the existing properties portfolio is expected to be stable in 2017.
not only will the softer performance of our core business weigh on the core profit of 2017. the recognition of a major asset disposal gain in 2016 has also materially raised the base for comparison for the 2017s core profit, which might result in a decline in core profit for 2017. nonetheless, the prudent and targeted expansion strategy that we have put in place over the past several years should drive the groups long term earnings growth. meanwhile, we are well placed to pursue acquisitions, as we have a strong balance sheet, and we will continue to explore value-added investments in global markets where asset values are cyclically suppressed.
