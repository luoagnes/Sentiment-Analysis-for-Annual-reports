business review & outlook for the fiscal year of 20052006, the group achieved a turnover of hk$3,778 million and has recorded a net profit of hk$600 million. this represents an increase in turnover of 36.3% and an increase in net profit of 43.6% over last year. during the year, we have started our seventh production line (pm7), with an annual capacity of 400,000mt, at our newest hongmei plant, which is expected to bring contributions in the coming years. now, all seven of our paper production lines (pm1 to pm7) and our pulp mill, with an annual paper capacity of 1,600,000mt and an annual pulp capacity of 200,000mt, are running at full capacity.
as chinas economy grows, chinas paper consumption will also grow at similar pace. while we expect china continue to be the most important market for our products, we will also be selling our products outside china to enhance our leadership position internationally. our low cost structure, our superior quality and our strategic location make our products extremely competitive in the global market.
within china, we will be introducing a wider range of products for different customers needs. further, our piers at changshu and chongqing are expected to be operational soon. with these piers, we hope to serve our customers better in the yangtze river delta and in the south-west region of china by allowing us to make more timely deliveries at a lower cost.
in order to supply the growing china and export markets, we have plans to start four new production lines in the next 18 months. our eighth and tenth production lines (pm8 and pm10) will start operation at our changshu plant. likewise, our ninth and eleventh production lines (pm9 and pm11) will start operation at our hongmei plant. with this expansion, the groups annual paper capacity will exceed 3,100,000mt, making the group one of the largest containerboard producers in the world.
