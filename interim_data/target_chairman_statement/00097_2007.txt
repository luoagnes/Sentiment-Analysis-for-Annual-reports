the hong kong and china gas company limited background and lines of business (i) hong kong core businesses founded in 1862, the hong kong and china gas company limited was the fi rst public utility in hong kong and today remains the sole supplier of piped gas in hong kong. its core businesses comprise production and distribution of gas, marketing of gas and gas appliances, and comprehensive after-sales services. hong kong and china gas serves over 1.6 million local customers spread throughout hong kong, kowloon peninsula, some new towns in the new territories, as well as north lantau island including the hong kong hong kong and china gas continues to expand its gas network to cope with the public demand for clean and reliable supply of energy. the 24 km eastern transmission pipeline will allow the eastern part of the new territories to have a ring-feed system when it is completed in 2007.
similar work for the western new territories also began in 2006. by the end of 2006, its town gas pipeline network in hong kong stood at around 3,236 km, covering 85% of hong kong s households.
in order to receive natural gas from the guangdong liquefied natural gas (lng) terminal, hong kong and china gas has laid twin 34 km submarine pipelines from chengtoujiao in shenzhen to tai po gas production plant in hong kong. following the commissioning of both pipelines and natural gas receiving stations in tai po, natural gas and naphtha have been used as a dual feedstock mix for producing town gas since october 2006. the signing of a 25-year contract in 2003 by hong kong and china gas has secured natural gas at a price currently lower than that of naphtha. savings on fuel costs have been passed on to customers, thus enhancing the competitiveness of its (ii) mainland china businesses during the past decade, hong kong and china gas has been actively developing piped city-gas businesses in mainland china. a signifi cant milestone was reached in december 2006 when it agreed to acquire an approximately 43.97% equity stake in towngas china company limited ( towngas china , formerly known as panva gas holdings limited), a well-established mainland china piped city-gas operator, in exchange for interests in ten hong kong and china gas s piped city-gas projects in shandong and anhui provinces.
hong kong and china gas group has subsequently appointed four executive directors, including the chairman, to the board of directors of towngas china. with the injection of hong kong and china gas s management expertise, fi nancial resources and technical skills, towngas china will improve its operational competitiveness. with the ability to advance more rapidly in mainland markets where towngas china s network is fi rmly entrenched, such as the southwest and northwest of china, hong kong and china gas will also extend its reach within mainland china. on a combined basis, hong kong and china gas and towngas china have a total of 60 piped city-gas projects, spread across 11 provinces and an area of beijing.
having established a solid base, hong kong and china gas is now expanding its scope of investments to include upstream natural gas and some other energy related businesses. hong kong and china gas also operates water supply projects in wujiang, jiangsu province and in wuhu, anhui province, and manages an integrated water supply and wastewater joint venture in suzhou industrial park, suzhou, jiangsu province. diversification is rapidly transforming hong kong and china gas group from its origins as a local company focused on a single business into a sizeable, nationwide, multi-business corporation.
(iii) diversifi ed businesses through its wholly-owned subsidiary, the eco energy company limited, hong kong and china gas has diversifi ed into various green businesses including liquefi ed petroleum gas (lpg) vehicle filling stations and the utilization of landfi ll gas. to date, eco is operating a total of fi ve lpg filling stations, which are strategically located in chai wan, mei foo, tuen mun, west kowloon and wan chai.
eco was also the fi rst organization in hong kong to utilize landfill gas for commercial use. construction of an on- site treatment facility and a 19 km pipeline connecting the north east new territories landfi ll gas project to tai po gas production plant were both completed in 2006. with their full commissioning, landfi ll (methane) gas will be captured and processed, partially replacing naphtha as a fuel for town gas production. the reduced fl aring-off of methane into the atmosphere brings improvements in air quality, while the reduced use of naphtha, which comes from the cracking of fossil fuel, will also save scarce natural resources.
in the mid-1990s, hong kong and china gas entered the local property development business in hong kong, with the aim of realizing the potential of its land resources and maximizing returns to its shareholders by deploying its excess cash. in 1995, hong kong and china gas took a 45% equity interest in the king s park hill development project, which was completed in early 2000 with a mixture of luxury houses and apartments. in 1996, it participated in the development of international finance centre, a landmark project in the heart of hong kong, and in which it currently held a 15.8% stake. grand promenade and grand waterfront, two successful luxury residential developments, were also co-developed by hong kong and china gas and henderson land. it has a 50% interest in the grand promenade project at sai wan ho, while for the grand waterfront at the former south plant site at ma tau kok, it is entitled to 73% of the net sales proceeds of the residential portion, in addition to the full interest in the commercial and the unaudited profi t after taxation attributable to shareholders of hong kong and china gas for the six months ended 30 june 2007 amounted to hk$5,469.9 million, including a hk$2,235.7 million gain resulting from the acquisition of shares in towngas china by way of asset injection and a hk$1,270.4 million profi t resulting from the sale of properties and revaluation surplus on an (i) gas business in hong kong for the six months ended 30 june 2007, the 1.9% drop in the volume of residential gas sales was offset by 3.2% growth in the volume of commercial and industrial gas sales, leading to a slight increase of 0.2% in the total volume of gas sales in hong kong. as at 30 june 2007, the number of customers was 1,631,302, an increase of 24,461 from the end of june (ii) business development in mainland china hong kong and china gas s mainland businesses are progressing well. its first coalbed gas liquefaction joint venture project started in early july 2007 in jincheng, shanxi province with commissioning expected by mid-2008. it also established its fi rst joint venture for energy exploitation in early 2007 in jilin province.
following the acquisition of towngas china as an associated company, its well-recognised and reputable brand name of towngas in chinese has been adopted by hong kong and china gas for the mainland city-gas businesses.
inclusive of towngas china, hong kong and china gas currently has a total of 70 projects spread across 13 provinces and an area of beijing, encompassing upstream, midstream and downstream natural gas sectors as well as the water supply and wastewater treatment sector.
(iii) environmentally-friendly energy business the energy businesses run by eco energy company limited, which is wholly-owned by hong kong and china gas, and its subsidiaries (together known as eco ) are revenue from eco s dedicated liquefied petroleum gas fi lling stations increased during the fi rst half of 2007. eco is now leveraging its expertise by developing environmentally- friendly energy businesses on the mainland. an experimental project involving the construction and operation of several compressed natural gas fi lling stations for heavy duty trucks is running in shaanxi province.
eco s landfi ll gas project is also progressing well and the north east new territories ( nent ) landfi ll gas treatment facility was commissioned in early 2007. treated landfi ll gas is being transported to tai po gas production plant via a 19 km pipeline to partially substitute naphtha as a fuel for town in 2002, eco signed a 40-year franchise agreement with the hong kong airport authority to design, construct and commission a permanent aviation fuel facility at tuen mun area 38 so as to supply aviation fuel directly to hong kong international airport. the project is progressing as scheduled and is expected to be commissioned by 2010.
(iv) property developments for the six months ended 30 june 2007, hk$728.2 million was recognized as its share of profits arising from the sale of units at grand promenade, grand waterfront and king s park hill property development projects, whilst its share of a revaluation surplus from international finance centre was hk$542.2 million. for the same period of last year, hong kong and china gas s share of profits from its sales of properties was hk$117.7 million and its share of a revaluation surplus from the abovementioned investment property was hk$588.2 million. leasing for the 150,000-square feet commercial area at grand waterfront, a property development project located at the ma tau kok south plant site, started in the second half of 2007.
as a result of the implementation of a dual naphtha and natural gas feedstock mix in october 2006, feedstock costs have decreased to the benefi t of customers in hong kong. also, in mainland china, hong kong and china gas will develop upstream, midstream, downstream and emerging energy markets at a faster rate and it is expected to have good prospects for its mainland a review of the discontinued operations is contained in the all of the group s bilateral banking facilities to fund the general operations are denominated in hong kong dollars. for the group s subsidiary, china investment group limited, a portion of its borrowings to fund its toll road project in mainland china is denominated in renminbi. apart from its investments in china which are denominated in renminbi and are not hedged, the group had no other material open foreign exchange positions at the year end.

through the disposal of interests in certain companies, the group successfully unlocked value for shareholders and allowed them to realize part of this value in cash through the distribution, as explained in the circular to shareholders dated 20 april 2007.
following completion of the transaction, the group concentrated on the infrastructure business in mainland china, in addition to its shareholding in hong kong and china gas.
traffi c fl ows in the yangtze river delta region are expected to grow in tandem with the robust economic development there, whilst car ownership will also increase because of improving affordability. thus, the group entered into agreement on 29 august 2007 to acquire the remaining 35.94% interest in china investment group limited at a consideration of approximately hk$145.02 million, making it a wholly-owned subsidiary of the group. this acquisition is a refl ection of the group s strategy to expand the infrastructure business.
hong kong and china gas is expected to perform well both in hong kong and mainland china. in hong kong, its price competitiveness has been enhanced through the introduction of natural gas, while its mainland business will also further prosper since the total number of its piped city gas projects has increased with the acquisition of towngas china.
