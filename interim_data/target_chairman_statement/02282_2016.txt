chairperson s statement james joseph murren as eight is an auspicious number in asia, we are proud to celebrate our eighth year in operations in 2015. during our eight years in macau, mgm china has achieved great business milestones, including: the 2007 opening of mgm macau, the 2011 ipo of mgm china holdings limited on the hong kong stock exchange and paid our first dividend to shareholders in 2012, in 2013 we were awarded the land concession to develop our second property in macau and we broke ground on mgm cotai, in 2015 we celebrated the topping off of mgm cotai and were awarded most honored company in the gaming and lodging sector by institutional investor .
over the past eight years, mgm has also established itself as a macau business with a genuine commitment to the local community. our staff of approximately 5,800 is approximately 80% local, as is our management team. mgm has invested in the diversification of macau by bringing world class art to both entertain our local community and drive international visitation. over the years we have brought sandro botticelli, the biennial of the lions, red sandalwood art exhibition, and more recently contemporary portuguese artist joana vasconcelos to mgm macau. investing in our local businesses has also been a consistent priority with over 80% of our procurement going to local macau businesses.
