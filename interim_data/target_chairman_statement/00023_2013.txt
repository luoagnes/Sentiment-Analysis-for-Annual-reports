chairman s statement it is my great pleasure to report that the bank of east asia group ( group ) delivered another set of record results for 2012, with strong contributions from across the group. profit attributable to owners of the parent reached a new high of hk$6,056 million, hk$1,698 million, or 39.0%, greater than the hk$4,358 million earned in 2011. basic earnings per share stood at hk$2.72. return on average assets and return on average equity were 0.9% and 11.9%, respectively.
the board of directors has declared a second interim dividend (in lieu of final dividend) of hk$0.63 per share for the year ended 31st december, 2012, bringing the dividend for the year to hk$1.06 per share.
the small, open hong kong economy is particularly vulnerable to external events, and local growth slowed as overseas economies struggled in 2012. however, economic conditions stabilised from the end of the third quarter and investment sentiment improved, leading to a strong recovery in financial markets from september. bea maintained a close focus on creating value for customers and investors, providing best in class financial services and seeking investment opportunities that generate much of bea s growth in recent years is attributable to the success of the bank in developing new business links between the mainland, hong kong and overseas. to this end, bea operates highly integrated banking networks in hong kong and the mainland, supported by a balanced presence in regional and international markets. going forward, the bank s strategic focus is two-fold: to further build on its advantage in supporting business flows between hong kong, the mainland and overseas; and to provide a wider range of banking services to each individual customer.
assisted by beas extensive network on the mainland, bea hong kong has capitalised on strong demand from mainland corporations to increase its cross-border trade finance business significantly. the bank is now building on these relationships, introducing and selling a wider range of products and services geared to meeting the specific needs of mainland corporations as they become more active in overseas markets.
bea anticipates further favourable policy changes in the near term that will create even greater opportunities for cross-border business, particularly in the development zones of qianhai, hengqin and nansha. in future years, business originating in china is expected to continue to drive growth in hong kong.
the banks wholly owned mainland subsidiary, the bank of east asia (china) limited ("bea china"), will maintain its proven business strategies, steadily expanding its branch network and strengthening its e-distribution capabilities, investing in new product development and focusing on the niche areas in which it has a competitive advantage.
the number of outlets operated by bea china has climbed rapidly, from 28 on the date of its founding in march 2007 to 114 at the end of 2012. during 2012, bea china conducted an extensive review of the business activities of its mainland branches and set new priorities for the coming years. following this review, a rationalisation programme will be implemented in 2013 to drive efficiency, control costs and focus resources where they will generate higher returns.
bea china will expand its clientele, targeting in particular medium-sized enterprises. as part of this strategy, bea china has developed a specialised class of products for supply chain financing to assist clients in managing their domestic trade. these products offer convenience and efficiency for clients, while generating new deposits and new income sources for the bank.
the international operations of the bank reported record profits amid robust growth in both loans and deposits in 2012. asset quality saw significant improvement, as the impairment loan ratio returned to normal levels. growing trade-refinance business and good performance by beas associate bank in malaysia were major contributors to the rise in profits from international operations.
the sale of an 80% interest in the bank of east asia (u.s.a.) n.a. to industrial and commercial bank of china limited (icbc) was completed in july 2012.
bea anticipates that the growing commercial ties between china and the united states (us) represent a substantial opportunity for the unit under icbc management. meanwhile, bea will continue to develop its wholesale banking businesses in the us through its federal branches in new york and los angeles.
over the past decade, bea has entered into a number of agreements with strategic partners, and enjoys very good relations with overseas financial institutions. in cooperation with these partners, in 2013 bea will further expand its cross-border referral business.
the bank made welcome progress in its efforts to improve cost-to-income performance during the past year. to further enhance operating efficiency, the bank will step up investments in innovation, particularly in technologies that reduce the cost of providing banking services. in parallel, the bank will further develop its iphoneandroid applications and hone its marketing initiatives in order to enhance beas appeal to the younger generation. the bank will continue to innovate, applying appropriate technology to further improve the customer experience.
the bank maintains a sound and efficient capital position to support its business goals and meet changing regulatory requirements. with new capital adequacy rules now being phased in, bea has implemented an ongoing programme to make more efficient use of capital through pricing and asset allocation. in the coming year, the bank will increase the proportion of interest-earning assets that require a lower capital charge, and raise the ratio of fee income to total income through the sale of insurance, investment and treasury products.
in december 2012, bea concluded a share placement with sumitomo mitsui banking corporation (smbc) in the amount of hk$3,301 million to further enhance the banks capital position. this followed the successful issue of subordinated notes by the bank in march and april 2012 in an aggregate amount of $800 million singapore dollars. smbc and bea have a long history of cooperation, and both banks welcomed this opportunity to further enhance their strategic relationship.
i take pleasure in thanking our banks board of directors and the directors of our subsidiaries and associated companies for their unstinting support and invaluable advice during the past year. i would also like to thank the management and staff of bea for their commitment and outstanding performance, and i look forward to working as a team in the coming year to execute our business strategies and develop new growth opportunities. our relationships with overseas financial institutions are invaluable, and i thank the directors and managements of these institutions for making our business partnerships such an outstanding success. i also take great pleasure in thanking our shareholders and customers for their long- standing loyalty and confidence in the bank.
dr. lee shau-kee, who joined the board in 1987, will retire as a director of the bank on 24th april, 2013. he has served the board with distinction for more than 26 years, making an invaluable contribution to the development of the bank during that period. on behalf of the board, i express my heartfelt gratitude to dr. lee for his wise counsel and guidance over the past 26 years.
