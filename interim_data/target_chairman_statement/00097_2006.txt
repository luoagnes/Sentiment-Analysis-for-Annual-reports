henderson cyber limited in august 2005, the company, henderson land development company limited ( henderson land ), hong kong and china gas and henderson cyber jointly announced the privatisation proposal of henderson cyber by the company and hong kong and china gas by way of a scheme of arrangement involving the cancellation and extinguishment of the scheme shares in henderson cyber at the cancellation price of hk$0.42 in cash per scheme share. the scheme was approved by a majority of 99.96% of the independent shareholders present and voting at the court meeting. the scheme took effect in december 2005 and the listing of the shares in henderson cyber on the growth enterprise market of the stock exchange of hong kong limited was withdrawn. upon completion of the privatisation, the company s interest in henderson cyber was increased to approximately 78.69%, with the balance of 21.31% held by the hong kong and china gas company limited. the aggregate amount of cancellation price paid by the group was henderson land made a second attempt to privatise the company in november 2005, following an unsuccessful privatisation effort in november 2002 ( the 2002 exercise ). as announced in december 2005, the cancellation consideration was increased to one share in the henderson land in exchange for every 2.5 scheme shares in the company. in order for the proposal to succeed, the scheme should not be disapproved by more than 10% in value of all the shares held by independent minority shareholders of the company (the 10% threshold ).
at the court meeting held on 20 january 2006, a majority of up to 85.7% (as compared with 85.6% in the 2002 exercise) of the independent minority shareholders of the company present voted in favour of the privatisation proposal. however, since the votes that were cast against the scheme marginally exceeded the 10% threshold a repeat of the 2002 exercise, the scheme could not take effect and hence lapsed. it is regrettable that, despite the majority support of independent minority shareholders of the company on both occasions, the privatisation proposal on each occasion fell through by the narrowest of margin under the 10% threshold.
issue of new shares on 18 april 2006, pursuant to a placing agreement, a subsidiary of henderson land sold 230 million existing shares of the company at the placing price of hk$13.55 per share. pursuant to the placing agreement, the company then issued 230 million new shares to henderson land at the placing price adjusted for this purpose by the expenses incurred in relation to the placing and the subscription.
the new shares represented approximately 8.2% of the company s then existing issued share capital and about 7.5% of its issued share capital as enlarged by the subscription.

the group has always adhered to prudent financial management principles. at 30 june 2006, the cash holdings of the group amounted to approximately hk$5,177.0 million (2005: hk$2,800.2 million). after netting off the total bank borrowings of hk$113.9 million (2005: hk$262.6 million), the group was in a net cash position of hk$5,063.1 million (2005: hk$2,537.6 million).
all of the group s bilateral banking facilities to fund the general operation are denominated in hong kong dollars. for the group s subsidiary, china investment group limited, a portion of its borrowings to fund its toll road projects in mainland china is denominated in renminbi. apart from its investments in china which are denominated in renminbi and are not hedged, the group had no other material open foreign exchange positions at the financial year end.

looking ahead, buoyant consumer confidence will continue to underpin retail spending and hence rental growth for shopping centres. the office market is expected to perform well on the back of tight supply being met by keen demand from companies looking for expansion opportunities. the continuing increase in expatriate inflow to hong kong will continue to fuel the hotel and residential market and sustain promising growth in rental rates. rental income from both new lettings and renewals is expected to rise.
as such, both the group s rental income, as well as recurring earnings from the group s listed associates, will continue to grow steadily.
with a strong cash position, the group is well poised to capitalize on opportunities for quality asset expansion and business growth, generating higher returns for shareholders. in the absence of unforeseen circumstances, performance of the group will show satisfactory growth in the coming financial year.

executive director mr. ho wing fun stepped down from the board on retirement during the year. i would like to thank mr. ho most sincerely for his long years of loyal service and immense contributions to the group.
i would also like to take this opportunity to thank the directors for their wise counsel and support, and the management and staff at all levels for their dedication, hard work and contributions in the past year. i know i can continue to count on them in our quest to deliver value to our shareholders.
