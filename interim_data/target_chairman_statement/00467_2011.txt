the group was mainly engaged in the development of strategy energy reserves, focusing on the investment and operation of oil, natural gas and other energy related businesses. this is accomplished by the merger and acquisition of oil and natural gas assets; the exploitation, development and production of crude oil and natural gas; and the provision of patented technologies supporting services to oilfields. the approach of the group is to implement the reliable operation + rapid expansion market strategy, which is supported by the unique technology and core competitiveness. the group s operating strategy utilizes resources as the foundation, built on its human capital and guaranteed by its technology.
the year 2010 was a milestone for the group s business development. during the period, the enhancing oil recovery project ( eor project ) in liaohe oilfields, which is the group s major assets, has obtained the approval by the national development and reform commission ( ndrc ) to commence the development period and, in february 2011, has reached the cumulative production quantity requirement to enter the production period with commencement of commercial production and sales to follow.
in addition, in order to attain strategic expansion, the group entered into a very substantial acquisition with british petroleum ( bp ) to take over their upstream business in pakistan. it enhances the group s position as an international upstream producing oil and natural gas player and lays the foundation as the first non-state owned enterprise of china to acquire an upstream oil business from an international oil major.
oil production business eor project, liaohe oilfields, bohai bay, liaoning, china leveraging on the major fireflood technology combined with other related techniques, the group conducted a large- scale industrialized eor development testing in enhancing oil recovery in liaohe oilfields. this project was approved unanimously at the technical confirmation meeting in july 2009, receiving high commendation from oil experts. the results also received full recognition from the national energy board. in july 2010, upon approval of the eor project by the ndrc, the development period of the eor project has commenced, enabling it to become the first sino- foreign cooperation project in oil industry of china that has adopted fireflood technology to enhance oil recovery rate.
this eor plan is jointly developed by the group and cnpc.
in february 2011, the eor project satisfied the requirements for the commencement of the production period, i.e. having an accumulated commercial incremental oil exceeding 20,000 metric tons. upon confirmation of the production period, the company will be allowed to sell its share of the oil produced with reference to international oil benchmarks. as the recovery rate increases the group s share of incremental oil will rise accordingly, contributing to the group s future turnover. the group s share of incremental oil, approximately 12,000 metric tons of oil produced as at february 2011, will be sold based on the prevailing international oil price and quality, and the net income shall be reflected in the financial statements for the year 2011.
