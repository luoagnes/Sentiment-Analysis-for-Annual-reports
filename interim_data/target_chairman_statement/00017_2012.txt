to our shareholders, what is seen and what is not seen by frdric bastiat1: there is only one difference between a bad economist and a good one: the bad economist confines himself to the visible effect; the good economist takes into account both the effect that can be seen and those effects that must be foreseen.
whenever a new thing is introduced to a system, there must be a series of effects triggered. of these effects, usually there is an immediate one, which appears simultaneously with its cause, desirable and easily foreseeable by a lot of people, i.e. seen . however, what matter, are actually the ones, which are not foreseeable by most of the general public, carry tremendous consequences, sometimes even disastrous, i.e. not seen . a bad economist pursues a small present good that will be followed by a great evil to come, while a good economist pursues a great good to come, at the risk of a small present evil.
this theory also applies in many cases and situations such as running a business. whenever a decision is made, there is something you want to achieve followed by possible impacts on the organisation, employees, customers or competitors. a good balance has to be stroked to have a home-run result together with some minimal negative side effects.
both the seen and unseen factors have to be carefully examined beforehand.
