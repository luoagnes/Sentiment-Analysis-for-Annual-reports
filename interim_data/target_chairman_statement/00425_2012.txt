on 7 march 2011, the group as the purchaser, entered into a share purchase agreement with korea fuel-tech corporation ( kftc ) and mr. chung koo lee for the acquisition of 45% equity interest in beijing kftc co., ltd. ( beijing kftc ). due to the changes in the market which affect the group s consideration on the long-term commercial interests, it ceased the acquisition of 45% equity interest in beijing kftc on 3 february 2012, but continued to keep the commercial relationship with kftc.
after years of development, the group now has a more complete network in china and broader presence in the other regions globally, a preferable position in the domestic market and growing importance in the overseas markets, very vertically integrated design and manufacturing chain and improved global response based on the belief of the long-term growth of the passenger vehicle market in china and the spacious room in global markets, i would be glad to see the group to insist on the approach heading towards the goal it has set forth all long.

with the view of globalization and for the goal to be an important player in the world market, the group has to face the challenges arising from the cross-culture integration and the management efficiency. the group restructured the control and cooperation model between its head offices and regional departments, arranged internal trainings and established a mutual learning investor relations and
the group s investor relations department has been dedicated to effective communication with hong kong and international investors through analysts briefings, roadshows, reception of routine visits by investors as well as maintaining corporate website, so as to ensure that investors receive timely and accurate information about the latest developments of the company, thus helping to enhance the transparency of the company.

china's passenger vehicle market is still at a growth phase, but the pressure coming from the wage inflation, rmb appreciation, potential price war among the car manufacturers, change of relevant policies in china market and the temporary volatility in the global economy may possibly impact the group s margin.
it has been my belief that globalization would be an appropriate way to mitigate the pressure and could provide the group with a spacious room, higher platform and more possibilities of future on the other hand, the group, which has started to set foot in the aftermarket products, electric vehicle parts and welfare vehicle and equipment may benefit from the trend of vehicles with better quality, individualization and better energy efficiency becoming the main stream of the market demand.

on behalf of the board of directors, i would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to our management and employees for their loyalty, diligence and hard work for the group during the review year. at the same time, i would also like to thank all shareholders for their support and trust. with such assistance and support, the group is confident of generating long-term and greater value for chin jong hwa
