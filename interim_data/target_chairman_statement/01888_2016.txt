chairman s statement
on behalf of the board of directors, i am delighted to report to our shareholders that kingboard laminates holdings limited ( the company ) and its subsidiaries ( the group ) delivered satisfactory results for the financial year ended 31 december 2015. global economic growth was slow while demand was weak during the year. however, benefitting from the upgrading of telecommunications networks and the development of smart electric vehicles, as well as replacement demand for electrical appliances driven by the internet of things, the high-technology electronics market recorded strong sales. this has resulted in intense demand for high-performance laminates.
at the same time, after going through years of fierce market consolidation, the demand-supply balance in the laminates market has evidently improved.
over recent years, the group has actively expanded the production of high- performance, value-adding laminates and the supply of upstream materials.
these efforts have yielded great results for the group. output and shipment of glass epoxy laminates ( fr4 ) have both set new high records.
