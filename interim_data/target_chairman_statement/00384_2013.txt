china gas embraces its second golden the fy2013 unfolded the first year in the group's second decade of development, setting the foundation for the group to roll out its second stage of development. in reviewing the group's path of growth, we are pleased that the group has captured every opportunity derived from china s soaring demand for energy alongside the national structural reform on the public utility sectors. having established for ten years since its founding in 2002, the group has rapidly evolved into an integrated trans- regional energy service provider with over 300 subsidiaries and branches. currently, the group owns city piped gas projects across 184 cities and regions in mainland china. in terms of the number of projects, the group is the largest city gas operator in mainland china.
facing the revolution of gas consumption in the world, the development and utilization of energy have been in the spotlight all around the world. china, the second largest energy consumption country after the us, is experiencing a noticeable demand growth in energy as its economy surges.
the group achieved impressive results during the year. in particular, it made great strides in the development regarding gas sales, gas connection to users, safety operation management, customer services, fulfillment of corporate social responsibility, technology innovation and new business exploration, materializing and surpassing the targets set at the beginning of the year.
meanwhile, the group smoothly transformed the mode of its management and control, and officially initiated the three-level management involving the headquarters, the regional centers for management and control and project companies, realizing the decision-making in the headquarters, the management across regions and the implementation by project companies. the new mode gave a significant boost to management efficiency and further motivated project companies to optimize their performance, thus laying a solid foundation for the leapfrogging development of the group during its second decade.

another decade signifies a fresh start. when encountering new opportunities and challenges under unprecedented conditions, the group will make headway by overcoming difficulties, develop through the process of transformation, enhance strengths through innovation, and constantly seek the path to prosperity well suited for the ever-changing external environment and the group s actual situation, in a bid to realize the ambitious goal of the in recent years, china has paid increasing attention to environmental protection and efficient use of energy, aggressively promoted the use of clean energy such as natural gas in order to facilitate the adjustment in energy structure as well as energy conservation and emission reduction. china s twelfth five-year plan for energy development published in january 2013 states that the demand for natural gas will rise significantly as a result of the deepening urbanization in china which leads to a population expansion in urban areas. the twelfth five-year plan for natural gas development issued by the ndrc in october 2012 predicts that the consumption of natural gas in china will surpass 260 billion cubic meters by 2015. accelerating the development of natural gas is, therefore, the inevitable choice of raising the proportion of natural gas in primary energy consumption, and also a pressing need for facilitating energy conservation and emission reduction.
as a large-scale integrated energy service provider, the group will fully leverage on its existing corporate management mode, prudent financial control, professional operating capacity and the service-oriented concept to further strengthen its foothold in the two core businesses natural gas and lpg business. to this end, apart from proactively pushing forward the organic growth in the existing gas projects, the group will develop various business ideas to explore new markets in urban economic development zones, industrial parks and industrial villages and towns which have enormous potential users of natural gas. in addition, the group will energetically promote cnglng utilization for vehicles and vessels, so as to form a synergy with the current two core businesses. during the proactive development of our core businesses, the group will sparkplug our staff to fulfill corporate social responsibility. as such, the group will set high standards in respect of business ethics, consumer care, environmental protection, and continuously put them in practice. specifically, a wide range of public welfare events will be launched, such as community safety programs and campaigns of caring for the elderly, blood donation, and donation to disaster-stricken areas.
with a strong sense of gratitude, the group will return the society with actions delivering welfare benefits, thus pushing forward the harmonious development of society.
