when compared to previous reported years, pou sheng, the company holding the retail operations in the greater china region, experienced a mild deceleration in activity due to the slow down in domestic demand after the olympics and the moderation in global consumer demand triggered by the global downturn. these challenges have slowed the growth trend for turnover and profit as observed in previous years. however given the size and infant state of the athletic footwear and apparel market in the greater china region, senior management believes that pou sheng will soon return to a trend of strong growth and continue to serve as the key driver for the group s turnover and earnings growth in the future.
