market and business review during 2015, in order to cope with complex global economic environment and the increased economic downward pressure in china, the chinese government continued to regulate the macroeconomic conditions and introduced structural reforms, which resulted in a steady growth on national economy. in order to boost up the property market in china, the chinese government gradually relaxed certain property control measures based on macroeconomic performances, including the long-implemented property purchase quota, restrictions on down payment proportion for first-time and second-time buyers, and lowering the relevant tax rates. at present, except in several first-tier cities, property purchase quotas have been lifted in most domestic cities in china. also, many local banks continued to lower their housing loan interest rates, and many local governments have introduced a series of housing subsidy polices to further stimulate purchasing demands for property.
