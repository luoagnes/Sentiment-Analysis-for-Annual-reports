in 2011, qq.com consolidated its position as the most visited portal in china and commanded leading positions in key verticals such as entertainment, automobile, finance and sports. during the year, we deepened the integration between qq.com and tencent microblog to strengthen the media influence of both platforms and enhance our differentiation. we also continued to improve our content and operations to better address the needs of different user groups.

tencent microblog enjoyed substantial growth in 2011 and became the largest microblog in china with 373 million registered users and 68 million daily active users at the end of the year. this reflected our strategy of increasing user base and user activity by enriching content, optimising user experience and promoting our brand awareness through marketing programs. as a leading and influential social media in china, tencent microblog is well placed to capture the business opportunities as they emerge in future.

in 2011, we strengthened our leadership in mvas and continued to position for new growth opportunities in the industry. underpinned by the increased popularity of our bundled sms packages and rapid user increase of mobile games, our mvas business enjoyed solid revenue growth. on the regulatory front, the cancellation before verification policy introduced by china mobile in early 2011 has increased the volatility of realisation rates and dampened our revenue growth. we expect the impact of this policy to linger, and a new co-operation model for 2.5g products provides new policy uncertainties for the mvas industry.
