during the year, the group sought to expedite sales via a variety of new channels, in addition to solely relying on the traditional external sales first of all, the group endeavoured to enlarge its potential customer base through online service provider platforms, which were launched in a number of projects in guangzhou, chengdu, beijing, shanghai, suzhou, hangzhou and nanning. through those platforms, the group offered latest happenings on the projects to potential buyers in a timely manner and organised group visits to project sites to increase foot flow.
for example, we worked with soufun and netease to post project information online for the summit and guangzhou top of world, and organised offline visits and purchases. these efforts, coupled with relevant discount offers, have driven remarkable sales growth.
meanwhile, the group offered latest project information and enabled interactive customer activities through its wechat public account and wechat sales brochures for a number of projects.

3) persistence in maintaining product quality and protecting in 2014, a large number of developers in china adjusted selling prices in different regions in tandem with the down cycle of the market, to boost volume and speed up sell-through with price discounts. amid market doldrums, the group remained calm, with a firm belief that only high stance in quality and sound profit margin would assure long-term, stable development of a company. as a result, the group improved cost management, expedited construction progress and enhanced product quality control by developing a full range of product standards and exerting stringent control over the procurement and consumption of raw materials. meanwhile, the group also offered promotional discounts and minor pricing adjustments within reasonable ranges in selected regions or drove sales through other manners without resorting to substantial price cut, with the pre-condition being the subject project fulfills its predetermined profitability 4) stepping up preparations of commercial projects to lay a solid foundation for long-term the group believes that possessing a diversified portfolio of investment properties is essential for its long-term development. investment property can serve to divert operational risks and generate stable, long-term income. at the same time, the development of an investment property and the accretion of its market value will drive the gentrification of the area as well as the value growth of neighbouring projects.
during the year, the group actively started preliminary preparations for commercial projects.
we studied and explored various approaches for shopping mall and office management, especially in connection with the operation of shopping malls, in order to create malls that would bring unique experiences to customers. unlike traditional malls in the market, shopping malls built by the group will feature customized architecture that showcase exquisite quality to customers with local touch and flair. examples include tian hui plaza, a refined lifestyle centre for the fashionable and high-worth population in the heart of pearl river new town, guangzhou, and u fun, a leisure ground built in xinjiangwan, shanghai in integration with a green land belt of the city.

to assure sufficient funding, the group also secured a syndicated loan in hong kong in november to further broaden its financing options 6) prudent land acquisition strategy calling for well-timed the group persists in a prudent land acquisition strategy and controls the pace of land purchases with a stringent profitability requirement. the first half of the year represented a good time for acquiring good sites, as the land market was quiet with fewer competitors and prices were more reasonable. the group achieved discount-to-market prices as it acquired premium sites during a down cycle by land auctions in first- and second-tier cities. meanwhile, the group also acquired centrally located sites in first-tier cities through merger and acquisitions with third-party developers. for example, the group acquired a number of sites with very little premium in tongzhou of beijing, nanning wuxiang new district and the future science city of hangzhou, which are the core areas of future urban development. at city center of guangzhou, such as pazhou and guangzhou finance city, the group was engaged in joint development projects through equity cooperation with other local as the land market regained momentum in the second half of the year and competition became more intense, the group adjusted its land strategy in a timely manner to slow down its pace of land acquisition for a more prudent approach. towards the end of the year, the group debuted in zhengzhou to explore the northern china market.
the group believes that premium land resources will provide strong driving force and support the group s development in the coming years.

looking forward to 2015, the property market is expected to continue to develop in a stable and healthy manner with market-driven corrections.
2015 will mark the end to the era of astounding growth in prices and volume in the property market. in line with the direction of diminishing administrative intervention, the property sector is expected to be increasingly aligned with the market economy with growing competition.
