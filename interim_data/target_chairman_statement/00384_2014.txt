the global economy recovered as a whole with lingering uncertainties last year. the recovery in major economies began to consolidate. the us and european economies gradually came out of recession while asian economies ended on a positive note. against a backdrop of slowdown in economic growth, the chinese government and the public turned to focus on deepening reform, adjusting structure, pushing ahead with energy conservation and emission reduction, and preventing air pollution. stepping up efforts to develop clean energy has become one of the major national strategies for achieving the chinese dream . clean energy industry in china and china gas group has been given an unprecedented opportunity for achieving leap-forward development.
currently, china has become the largest energy consumer and the third largest natural gas consumer in the world.
looking into the future, china s natural gas consumption will continue to grow rapidly and the golden age of natural gas will shift towards china. as at the end of 2013, the second west-east gas pipeline and the china-myanmar gas pipeline commenced operation upon full completion.
at present, the construction of the third west-east gas pipeline has commenced. an unified oil and gas pipeline network has thus taken shape in china. a 30-year natural gas supply agreement entered into by china and russia on 21 may 2014 is expected to diversify and increase the gas supply to china to meet the increasing demand for natural gas from the country. the action plan on prevention and control of air pollution ( promulgated by the state council of china in september 2013 has set out measures and policies on replacing small coal-fired boilers with gas-fired boilers and replacing oil with gas in transport sector. those measure and policies will have a considerable effect on the demand for natural gas. in addition, with the widespread use of the clean and convenient liquefied petroleum gas ( lpg ) in towns and rural areas and the rapid growth of lpg being used as raw materials in deep processing industry, the group will be given a rare chance to develop its lpg business. after integrating the lpg downstream network of panva gas in all aspects, the group will leverage the unique strength from the integrated upstream and downstream business of panva gas to progressively improve the utilisation of middle stream terminals and storage assets. the group will also continue to expand the lpg retail market with great potential for development to provide clean and efficient green energy to industrial and commercial users and residential users in towns and rural areas.
after ten years of rapid development, the group has become a key player in clean energy distribution sector in china. it is now supplying the clean natural gas and lpg to more than 15,000,000 residential users and 60,000 industrial and commercial users. the group will continue to adhere to the principle of maintaining profitability and fulfilling social responsibility synchronously while providing high quality services to the society and customers to become an integrated gas enterprise that is trusted by customers, respected by the society and managed perfectly and keeps on creating values for shareholders. lastly, i would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to our fellow board members, the management team and all the staff for their unremitting efforts and solidarity for more than ten years. i would also extend my thanks to shareholders, business partners and creditors for their trust and confidence on china gas.
