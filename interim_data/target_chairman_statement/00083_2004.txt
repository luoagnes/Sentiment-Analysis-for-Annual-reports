better economic and employment prospects together with low interest rates in early 2004 were the major catalysts driving the recent upward surge in the property market.
demand for private residential housing has been particularly strong. strong liquidity in the banking sector and continuing favourable mortgage terms have contributed to double digit-growth for property prices since the second quarter of 2003.

our shopping malls, such as the china hong kong city, olympian city 1 and 2 and tuen mun town plaza, have directly benefited from the market upturn and account for a substantial portion of our total gross rental income. the completion of five major projects in tsuen wan town centre redevelopment site, yeung uk road (tsuen wan) site, west kowloon reclamation site, ho tung lau site and oceania heights (tuen mun) in the next three financial years are expected to add a total of approximately 600,000 square feet of retail space to our rental portfolio.
these projects are expected to greatly enhance our income from the rental sector in the years to come.

given the strong economic fundamentals, a healthy sustainable growth in the property market and our development land bank (excluding completed investment properties and properties held for sales) of 11.5 million square feet, which were mainly acquired between 2000 and the first half of 2004, the company is set for further positive growth in the next few years. the group shall continue to selectively replenish its land bank to optimise earnings. the directors are confident of the prospects of the staff and management
