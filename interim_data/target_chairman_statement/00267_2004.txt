a key business of c itic pacific is the generation of electric power,and 2003 has provided c itic pacific with the following excellent opportunities: the ligang power station in wuxi, jiangsu province is the flagship of our company s power business. construction of its third 2x600mw phase began in 2003 and operation is planned for 2006. the fourth phase, also 2x600mw, is expected to be operational in 2007. equipment for both phases has already been ordered. c itic pacific recently acquired an additional 9% of the ligang power station phases i and ii and now owns 65%. our shareholding in phases iii and iv will be higher at 73%.
also in wuxi, an application to build a pumped storage facility with a capacity of 700mw is being considered by the relevant authorities.
in january 2004 we became a 20% owner of the north united power corporation, which has an attributable generating capacity of 4,310mw, all in inner mongolia.another 920mw of attributable capacity is being planned for 2004. north united power corporation is now a partnership between inner mongolia electric co. and two other major power companies china huaneng group and shenhua group. inner mongolia has substantial coal deposits making it an ideal location for power generation, both for the requirements in the autonomous region, and to supply electricity to north and northeast china through the grid.
in coming years north united power will continue to build additional capacity with the aim of becoming one of the largest power generation companies in mainland china.
