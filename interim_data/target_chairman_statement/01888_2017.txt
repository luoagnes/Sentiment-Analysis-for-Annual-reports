on behalf of the board of directors, i am delighted to report to our shareholders that kingboard laminates holdings limited (the company) and its subsidiaries (the group) delivered outstanding results for the financial year ended 31 december 2016. benefitting from the upgrades in automobile electronics, smart home appliances and the wide application of light-emittingdiode (led) products, overall demand for laminates was robust during the year. prices of glass fabric and other upstream materials rose substantially due to tight supply, thereby driving laminates selling prices to increase further.
as a world-leading laminates manufacturer, the group has made multiyear investments in expanding upstream capacity, resulting in a strong and comprehensive vertically integrated supply chain. thus, while the groups competition was cutting back on production due to shortages of upstream material, the group was able to expand its product sales on the back of its vertical advantage. as a result, the group was able to achieve a major breakthrough in both selling price and shipment volume.
in 2016, the group recorded a 22% increase in revenue to hk$15,531.7 million. underlying net profit (excluding non-recurring items) rose significantly by 61% to hk$1,947.2 million. the redevelopment project in respect of a site in shenzhen, guangdong province, originally designated for use by the groups production plant, was approved by government authorities.
during the year, the subsidiary which held the project was disposed of for a consideration of hk$2,386.2 million, driving the groups reported net profit to increase significantly by 243% to hk$4,346.6 million. in view of the groups healthy financial position, the board has proposed a final dividend of hk18.5 cents per share with a special final dividend of hk30.0 cents per share, subject to shareholders approval. together with the interim dividend of hk13.5 cents per share and special interim dividend of hk50.0 cents paid in october 2016, this will constitute a total dividend of hk112.0 cents per share for the full year.

in the second half of 2016, the group implemented multiple price increases of laminates in line with the price changes in upstream materials and the supply-demand dynamics of laminates market. benefitting from the increase in the average selling price, the groups gross profit was lifted to 22% from last years 17%. during the year, the group achieved an average monthly shipment volume of 10.8 million square metres, up 12% from the previous year. composite epoxy material laminates (cem) and glass epoxy laminates (fr4) contributed an aggregate revenue of hk$8,750.5 million, accounting for 56% of group revenue. paper laminates generated revenue of hk$2,029.0 million, representing 13% of the total. driven by the partial booking of pre-sales from kunshan development zone kingboard yu garden phase 3 and jiangyin kingboard yu garden phase 1, the property division recorded revenue of hk$1,779.0 million, or 11% of total group revenue. the balance mainly comprised sales of upstream materials and other products.
liquidity and capital resources
the groups consolidated financial and liquidity position remained robust. as at 31 december 2016, net current assets and current ratio of the group were approximately hk$8,584.2 million (31 december 2015: hk$9,878.9 million) and 1.95 (31 december 2015: 2.95) respectively.
the net working capital cycle decreased to 80 days as at 31 december 2016 from 115 days as at 31 december 2015, on the following key metrics: inventories significantly decreased by 47% and the stock turnover days, was 22 days (31 december 2015: 48 days).
trade receivables, including amounts due from fellow subsidiaries, in terms of debtor turnover days, was 88 days (31 december 2015: 106 
trade and bills payable, including amounts due to fellow subsidiaries, in terms of creditor turnover days, was 30 days (31 december 2015: 
net gearing as at 31 december 2015 was 15%. the group has strong cash flow during the year, net cash as at 31 december 2016 was hk$1,750.5 million. in 2016, the group invested hk$152.8 million in new production capacity and hk$1,162.0 million in its property business. backed by a highly experienced professional management team, a sound business foundation and solid financial strength, management is confident that these investments will deliver stable and satisfactory returns to shareholders over the long term.
the ratio of bank borrowings between short term and long term stood at 57%:43% (31 december 2015: 24%:76%). meanwhile, the group maintained sufficient financial resources to meet its requirements for future market 
the group continued to adopt a prudent financial management policy. the group did not enter into any material types of derivative financial instrument, nor did the group have any material foreign exchange exposure during the year. the groups revenue, mostly denominated in hong kong dollars, rmb and us dollars, was fairly matched with the currency requirements of its 
as at 31 december 2016, the group had a workforce of approximately 9,900 (31 december 2015: 10,400). in addition to offering competitive salary packages, the group grants share options and discretionary bonuses to eligible employees based on the groups overall financial achievements and individual employee performance.

looking ahead to 2017, the tight supply of upstream materials is unlikely to improve significantly due to the lengthy process involved in capacity expansion.
it is therefore expected that the undersupply of laminates will continue. the groups facilities for laminates and upstream material production are currently nearing full capacity but still unable to meet the strong market demand. thus there is room for upward price adjustments in those products.
in view of these market conditions, management plans to increase the capacity of both upstream materials and laminates, as well as to expand external sales proportion of upstream materials. this expansion programme will boost monthly capacity of glass yarn by 36% to 12,200 tonnes, glass fabric by 18% to 46.2 million metres, and cem and fr4 laminates by 10% to 6.6 million sheets.
the groups development of pvb business has also made breakthroughs following the successful self-development of pvb film with sound insulation function. looking forward, the group will expand sales of pvb film in vehicle glass and construction-use curtain wall markets.
finally, as regards the property division, the group will actively schedule the pre-sales of residential projects in kunshan, jiangsu province, in accordance with the prevailing domestic market circumstances in mainland china.
continued booking of sales from property projects are expected for this year.
the group currently has no plan to increase its land bank, but will strive to develop and sell its existing projects in order to expedite the realisation of the cash returns on property business.appreciation on behalf of the board, i would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to our shareholders, customers, banks, the management and employees for their unreserved support to the group in the past financial
