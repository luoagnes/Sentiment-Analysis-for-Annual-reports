chairman s letter the cathay pacific group reported an attributable profit of hk$3,150 million for 2014.
this compares to a profit of hk$2,620 million in 2013. earnings per share were hk80.1 cents compared to hk66.6 cents in 2013. turnover for the year increased by 5.5% to hk$105,991 million.
in the first half of 2014 our business was affected by high fuel prices, reduced passenger yield and continued weakness and over-capacity in the air cargo market. our business is normally better in the second half than in the first half. this was the case in 2014. for the full year, passenger demand was reasonably firm, with high demand during the peak summer and christmas periods. after a prolonged period of weakness, cargo demand started to improve in the summer of 2014 and was strong in the fourth quarter, which is the peak period for cargo. our business benefited from lower fuel prices in the fourth quarter, but this was partially offset by fuel hedging losses.
the group s passenger revenue for 2014 increased by 5.4% to hk$75,734 million. capacity increased by 5.9% as a result of the introduction of new routes (to doha, manchester and newark) and increased frequencies on some existing routes. the load factor increased by 1.1 percentage points to 83.3% and the number of passengers carried increased by 5.5% to 31.6 million. yield decreased by 1.8% to hk67.3 cents despite an improvement in the second half compared to the first half of the year.
passenger demand was strong in all classes of travel on long-haul routes. however, the increase in passenger numbers did not match the increase in capacity on north american routes. strong competition put downward pressure on yield on regional routes.
after a prolonged period of weakness, cargo demand started to improve in the summer of 2014 and was very strong in the fourth quarter. the group s cargo revenue in 2014 increased by 7.3% to hk$25,400 million compared to the previous year. over-capacity in the air cargo market put downward pressure on rates in the first half of the year. yield for the full year for cathay pacific and dragonair decreased by 5.6% to hk$2.19, despite improved cargo demand in the second half. capacity increased by 10.4%. the load factor increased by 2.5 percentage points to 64.3%. we managed capacity in line with demand in the first half of 2014, but were able to operate an almost full freighter schedule for most of the second half. our new cargo terminal worked effectively in its first full year of operation and made our cargo operations more efficient.
fuel is the group s most significant cost and our fuel costs in 2014 (disregarding the effect of fuel hedging) increased by 0.7% compared to 2013, significantly below the increase in passenger and cargo capacity of 5.9% and 10.4% respectively. fuel consumption increased because more flights were operated, but the introduction of more fuel- efficient aircraft and the retirement of less fuel-efficient aircraft moderated the increase. we also benefited from lower fuel costs in the fourth quarter. fuel accounted for 39.2% of our total operating costs, compared to 39.0% in 2013. managing the risk associated with high and volatile fuel prices is a priority. our fuel hedging contracts extend to 2018. the sharp reduction in fuel prices in the fourth quarter of 2014 caused a very welcome net benefit to overall profits. however, it resulted in losses on our hedging contracts. it also resulted in significant unrealised hedging losses. these unrealised losses are reflected in the consolidated statement of financial position at 31st december 2014 and caused a reduction in our consolidated net assets.
we continue to invest heavily in our fleet. we took delivery of 16 new aircraft in 2014: nine boeing 777-300er aircraft, five airbus a330-300 aircraft and (for dragonair) two airbus a321-200 aircraft. six boeing 747-400 passenger aircraft were retired during the period. in 2013, we agreed to sell our six boeing 747-400f freighters back to the boeing company. one of them was delivered in november 2014.
two of the remaining freighters are parked and all five of them will have left the fleet by the end of 2016. at 31st december 2014 we had 79 new aircraft on order for delivery up to 2024. a total of nine new aircraft are scheduled for delivery in 2015.
we continue to develop our passenger and cargo networks.
in 2014, cathay pacific introduced passenger services to doha, manchester and newark. we will introduce passenger services to zurich in march 2015, to boston in may 2015 and to dusseldorf in september 2015. we reorganised our network in the middle east in 2014. we stopped flights to abu dhabi and jeddah but improved our schedules on other middle eastern routes. we stopped flying to karachi.
the los angeles service was increased to four-times-daily from june 2014. the san francisco service will be increased to 17-times-weekly in june 2015. dragonair started flying to denpasar-bali and penang (replacing cathay pacific on the latter route), increased frequencies on a number of other routes and will introduce a daily service to haneda in tokyo in march 2015. dragonair will stop operating to manila in march 2015. cathay pacific tagged mexico city onto its guadalajara cargo service in march 2014 and increased this service to five flights per week in october 2014. we introduced cargo services to columbus in march 2014, to calgary in october 2014, to phnom penh in november 2014 and to kolkata in march 2015.
we continue to invest heavily in our product and brand. we have completed the installation of new or refreshed seats in all cathay pacific s aircraft which started in 2011. we will install new cabins in our airbus a350 aircraft, which are expected to start being delivered in february 2016. at 31st december 2014, new business and economy class seats had been installed in all dragonair airbus a330-300 and six a321-200 aircraft and new first class seats had been installed in six dragonair airbus a330-300 aircraft. in november 2014 we started to install new business and economy class seats in dragonair s airbus a320-200 aircraft and expect the installation to be completed in 2018.
in october 2014 we introduced a refreshed logo for cathay pacific. this is part of a new approach to design, to be seen for example on our website, in our new lounge at haneda in tokyo and in our refurbished first class lounge in the pier at hong kong international airport, which will open in the contribution from air china (the results of which are included in the group s results three months in arrear) was below expectations in 2014. air china s results were adversely affected by a difficult operating environment and substantial exchange losses caused by the depreciation of the renminbi in the early part of the year. as the year progressed, air china s results improved as a result of lower fuel prices. in 2014 we and air china made a substantial injection of capital and loans into air china cargo (our cargo joint venture with air china). this capital injection provided funds to enable the carrier to buy new aircraft and improve the performance of its cargo business. operational efficiency at air china cargo has been improved by the replacement of three boeing 747-400bcf converted freighters with four boeing 777-200f freighters in 2014. air china cargo also benefited from the general improvement in the air cargo market which began in the summer of 2014.

it was encouraging to see an overall improvement in our business in 2014. that improvement has continued in the first quarter of this year and we are positive about the overall prospects for 2015.demand in our cargo business continues to improve and is currently being helped by the congestion in sea ports on the west coast of the united states. we continue to benefit from the lower net fuel prices. our associates are also benefiting from these positive factors.while we face growing competition in our passenger business, which makes it harder to maintain yield, overall demand remains strong and the outlook in 2014 we continued our efforts to make cathay pacific and dragonair better airlines for our customers. the fact that we won the world s best airline award for the fourth time is clear recognition from air travellers worldwide of the work we have put into providing superior products and services. the group s financial position remains strong, which will enable us to continue with our long-term strategic investment in the business and our commitment to reinforcing hong kong s position as one of the world s premier aviation hubs.
