in february 2005, the group entered into an agreement to lease premises to fit-out a 195 room deluxe hotel in a prime piece of real estate to be developed in london. this hotel is slated for completion in 2009 and marks the entry of the group s signature hospitality product in a major european capital.

in 2004, the group signed seven new hotel management contracts for hotels owned by third parties. these include a traders hotel in media city, dubai, a shangri-la hotel on the palm island in dubai, the shangri-la hotel in dongguan, a traders hotel in urumqi and a shangri-la hotel in suzhou (all in mainland china), a shangri-la hotel in vancouver and a traders hotel in chennai, india. the group has also successfully rebranded a hotel in australia as the shangri-la hotel, the marina, cairns.
during the year, the traders hotel, dubai commenced operation.
the traders fudu hotel, changzhou (mainland china) opened for business on 3 january 2005.
in march 2005, the group signed hotel management contracts for three new hotels in bangalore, the technology capital of india.
based on contracts executed to date, the number of operating hotels under management and owned by third parties will increase from 8 as at 31 december 2004 to 27 by 2009.
corporate debt & financial conditions taking advantage of the liquidity in the financial market and the favourable conditions in the stock market, the group issued zero coupon guaranteed convertible bonds due march 2009 in the aggregate principal amount of us$200 million with an initial conversion price of hk$9.25 per share of the company (subject to adjustment) in march 2004 with net proceeds of approximately us$196.4 million, immediately following the issuance of new shares in february 2004 which generated proceeds of approximately hk$1,360 million. unless previously redeemed, converted or purchased and cancelled, these bonds will be redeemed at 114.633 percent of their principal amount on the maturity date. these proceeds provided funding for the acquisition of new land for future development and for financing the development of new hotels for the next 3 years.
the group has also successfully negotiated for the reduction of the interest margin for some of its unsecured bilateral hong kong dollars loan agreements with individual banks.
also taking advantage of the current liquidity and strong competitive environment in the banking system and with a view to address its capital commitment requirements for new projects, the group has executed 5 unsecured bilateral dual-currency loan agreements with individual banks in march 2005 in a total amount equivalent to us$524.1 million. these loans have a maturity of 5 years and their all-inclusive cost is 37 basis points over libor or hibor at the option of the group. this gives the group the flexibility for shifting the denominated currency from time to time in view of the financial market condition. these new loans have also served to push out loan maturities and reduced the loan interest margin.
the group has satisfactorily complied with all covenants under its with a generally improved business environment both regionally and globally, the group s hotels have experienced an impressive turnaround in revenues and profits. barring unforeseen circumstances, the momentum is expected to continue through 2005 and in the medium term. on the supply side, the group s hotels do not envisage significant additions to rooms supply in their competitive set which could destabilise their business.
given the economic fundamentals of mainland china, it remains the primary focus of the group s investment activities in the hotel sector.
the growing brand awareness of the group s hotels both regionally and globally is facilitating entry by way of management contracts in strategic markets such as europe, north america, india and the middle east. apart from underpinning brand strength, these contracts also serve to improve return on equity to shareholders which remains the group s primary objective.
