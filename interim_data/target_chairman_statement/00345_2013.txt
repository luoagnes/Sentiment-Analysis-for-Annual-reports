chairman s statement fy20122013 was a year in which vitasoy embarked on a new phase of sustainable growth following the completion of several capacity expansion projects. although we experienced very challenging operating environments in most of the markets, we continued to grow our business, deliver the expected top and bottom line results. this drive for organic growth has been in line with our long term planning strategy.

hong kong remained our core market. during the year, we successfully commissioned our new pet (polyethylene terephthalate) plastic bottle line and drove volume growth in this segment. mainland china has been our growth engine, registering an impressive 16% increase in sales revenue and 37% improvement in profit during the year. the increased production capacity from our new foshan plant allowed our china team to implement the go deep go wide strategy more effectively and expand our territorial coverage.
in australia and new zealand, we continued to lead the category growth in the alternate milk segment and enhance our distribution in new zealand. in the us, in spite of the continuation of manufacturing breakdowns, we maintained our leadership position in the packaged tofu market and drove category growth. in singapore, we expanded our business through an improved sales and channel mix.

to fortify our market leadership position, we continued to optimise our product portfolio and invest in advertising and promotion to build brand equity. we invested in our sales force and expanded our market share in the past year. our efforts in these areas have driven category expansion and overall we have completed our investments in production facilities, following the inauguration of our new foshan plant in mainland china, the installation of a fast-speed pet line at our tuen mun plant in hong kong in fy20112012 and the completion of the expansion program at our wodonga plant in australia this year. we are now well-positioned to capture new business opportunities going forward and will continue to invest in organic growth.
commitment to environment and people while we are committed to being financially sustainable, we are also doing our part to protect the environment by adopting energy efficiency programs. we have enhanced our operation processes and production facilities to conserve energy while achieving overall efficiency. we endeavor to integrate our business activities to contribute to the society through supporting local community events and staff involvement.
we continued to run the corporate wellness program to promote a healthy work-life balance culture. our talent management program has been expanded to mainland china and our career development plan for employees continues to groom high-calibre managers for future business needs.
the year ahead our strategy is to maintain sustainable business growth and build shareholder value over the long term. fy20132014 is expected to contribute towards achieving these objectives.
