for tel products, growth will be driven by commercial phones and other telecommunication products, which will see new offerings across the spectrum during the financial year 2015.

gains in market share will continue to be the growth driver for the group in the financial year 2015.

geographic expansion will see more emphasis on expanding outside north america and western europe, in order to capture growth opportunities. in asia pacific, the potential in china is huge and it will continue to be the most important market for development. the developed markets in the region such 4 source: marketwise consumer insights, llc and retail tracking service of npd group. ranking based on 2012 and 2013 total estimated annual retail sales in the combined toy categories of infant electronic learning and preschool electronic 5 source: mza ltd, 2014 as australia and japan will continue to be a focus. the group will also extend its reach to other markets including taiwan, malaysia and korea. in other regions, the group aims to grow sales in latin america and the middle east.
operational excellence underpins vtech s success. as costs in china are set to rise further, operational efficiency is becoming increasingly important. in addition to process improvement and product optimisation for manufacturing, the group will increase its application of automation by deploying more commercially available and in-house custom-made machines.
this will reduce the number of workers further, even as output increases. the group will also benefit from enhanced competitiveness as automation improves product quality, reduces time to market and increases flexibility in production.

economic recovery in the us appears to be on a sustainable footing, while the economies of western europe are improving.
with a stabilised market environment and new products ready to be launched, the group is targeting further revenue growth in the financial year 2015.
in addition to process improvement and product optimisation for manufacturing, the group will increase its application of automation by deploying more commercially available and in-house custom-made machines. this will reduce the number of workers further, even as vtech s product innovation and operational efficiency have given it market-leading positions in a number of areas. it continues to gain market share and expand geographically, while maintaining a strong financial position.
the group will continue to implement its sustainability strategies, while exploring every avenue of potential growth to generate higher returns for sales of elps in the financial year 2015 are forecast to increase as the strong momentum in standalone products carries through. innovative products including go! go! smart animals and switch & go dinos turbo, as well as new core learning products, will drive growth. despite the introduction of kidizoom smart watch, sales of platform products are still expected to be challenging. innotab will face rising competition as more low-cost tablets are being introduced to the consumer electronics aisles.
tel products revenue is also expected to increase. growth will be driven by commercial phones and other telecommunication products, as the group introduces new products and makes higher shipments of continuing products. sales of residential phones in europe and other regions are expected to recover, while in asia pacific growth will continue. in the us, although the residential phone market will shrink further, vtech will continue to increase its share.
cms is expected to grow further in the financial year 2015.
business with existing customers will increase, as the group continues to take market share from the competition. new customers will add a further stimulus to growth. to cope with higher expected demand over the next three years, the group plans to add a new cms factory building. this will raise manufacturing capacity by 25% once it enters operation in the middle of the calendar year 2015.
regarding costs, material prices are expected to hold broadly steady, although labour costs and manufacturing overheads in china will continue to rise. however, the group s gross profit margin is expected to be stable as efficiency gains through automation, process improvements and product optimisation should offset higher costs in china.
as a global company that is part of the communities in which it operates, vtech recognises the need to step up its effort to achieve sustainable development. the goal is to design, manufacture and supply innovative and high quality products in a manner that minimises any impact on the environment, while creating value for stakeholders and communities. to this end, vtech will continue to incorporate sustainability concepts into product design, improve energy and resource efficiency in operations, and upgrade employees living and working vtech s product innovation and operational efficiency have given it market-leading positions in a number of areas. it continues to gain market share and expand geographically, while maintaining a strong financial position. the group will continue to implement its sustainability strategies, while exploring every avenue of potential growth to generate higher returns for shareholders.
