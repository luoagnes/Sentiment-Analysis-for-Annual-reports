there was an old saying in ancient china from tai shi gong which says that there are two ways to regulate social behavior: by self-discipline and by law. self-discipline prevents improper behavior from occurring whereas law punishes improper behavior when crimes are committed. the deterrence effect of law enforcement is apparent while that of self- discipline may not be seen easily. if we consider self- discipline as a cultural discipline then it would be accurate to reflect that in the compliance operations of commercial banks. furthermore, in a modern economy, if an enterprise wishes to achieve long- term sustainable success, it has to seek value from its corporate culture. this is also the important reason why we always attach great significance to build our corporate culture in our strategic plans.
in 2006, we have developed and have fully put in place the frame-work of the 3-year corporate culture plan, with the aim of intensifying the process of building our own corporate culture. preliminarily, we have now successfully nurtured and established our corporate culture with accountability and innovation as core values. our employees have established a shared vision of the current status and progress of our corporate culture, as well as the mission and objective for future of our bank. every level of management is also encouraged to elevate their management skills from management by experience and management by system to management by culture . on this basis, we will make use of our corporate culture to enhance the bank s operation and to continuously strengthen the cohesiveness of the employees. as a result, we wish every member of our team to grow and to develop jointly with us so as to reach their individual goals and their career aims.
