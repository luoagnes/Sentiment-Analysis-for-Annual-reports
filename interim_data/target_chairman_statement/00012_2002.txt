for the group s agricultural land lots situate at lam tei, tuen mun and those located in ng uk tsuen, sheung shui, the change in land use into residential development land had taken place in the past financial year and the land conversion premiums were paid in full. these resulted in the replenishment of approximately 980,000 sq.ft. in development gross floor area attributable to the group. as a further development, the town planning board had also approved the increase of the maximum permitted plot ratio of the agricultural land lots located in ng uk tsuen, sheung shui from 3.3 times to 5 times, subject to payment of additional land premium. also, applications for the change of land use were made in respect of the second phase of the agricultural land plots situate at tai tong road, yuen long which, if approved, will be converted into a development site with attributable development gross floor area of approximately 440,000 sq.ft.. as for the agricultural land lots situate at wu kai sha, it is currently estimated this will become a residential development site with maximum permitted plot ratio of 3 times thereby providing attributable development gross floor area of approximately 1.7 million sq.ft.. good progress has also been made on the redevelopment plan of the yau tong bay project participated by the group as the relevant sites had been included under the enlarged yau tong bay comprehensive development area in the cha kwo ling yau tong lei yue mun outline zoning plan as gazetted by the government in june of this year. upon approval granted by the government, this yau tong bay redevelopment project will have attributable development gross floor area of approximately 1.72 million sq.ft.. also, the agricultural land situate at wo hing road, fanling is currently estimated to be converted into a residential development of approximately 580,000 sq.ft. in attributable gross floor area. further, application has been made in respect of the group s agricultural land lots situate at ma sik road, fanling north which aimed to seek approval from the town planning board for increasing the maximum permitted residential plot ratio of the site to 5 times, providing around 3 million sq.ft. in attributable development gross floor area for the entire project.

although office rental in hong kong recorded a general downward adjustment and the slowdown in the economy in the past financial year brought along its negative impacts on the local retailing and food sectors, the major retail shopping properties owned by the group were able to maintain an overall occupancy rate of 93% whilst rental levels generally remained steady. such resilience shown from the group s rental property portfolio is mainly a result of the positioning strategy adopted by the group whereby most of the group s retail shopping podiums are located in the new towns and right at the existing and planned mass transportation network. thus, during the financial year under review, there was an increase recorded in the rental level and also an improvement shown in the occupancy in respect of certain retail shopping centres owned by the group. the success of such positioning strategy was further evidenced by the launch of operation of the tsueng kwan o extension line by the mass transit railway corporation on 18th august, 2002 when the group s retail shopping centres situate at the phase ii and phase iii of the metro city project experienced a big increase in pedestrian traffic and brought about an increase in business turnover for the tenants of various trades located in these shopping centres. as at the end of the period under review, the total attributable gross floor area of the group s rental property portfolio amounted to 6.6 million sq.ft. in addition, the group also owns rental carparking space totally 2.5 million sq.ft. attributable to the group. as for the international finance centre located above the hong kong station of the airport express line, which is 47.5% jointly held by the group and the hong kong and china gas company limited as long-term investment properties, leasing result of phase i of this project was satisfactory. the second phase of this project will comprise an 88-storey office building with gross floor area of 1.95 million sq.ft., as well as retail shopping space and hotel properties of 510,000 sq.ft. and 1.1 million sq.ft.

economic recovery in the united states has been taking place at a slow pace at a time of uncertainty in the middle east. however, mainland china was able to show steady sustained growth. hong kong, being right at the southern gateway of mainland china, is able to benefit from its growth. there are abundant business opportunities to bring about the recovery of the local economy.
in the past, the land policy in hong kong was determined and handled by many departments within the government and has resulted in the over-supply of land. as a consequence, the local property market has been subjected to a long period of slowdown and property prices fell by more than half in value. recently, the government implemented changes to its land and housing supply policies, amongst welcoming signs of reduction in the supply of home ownership scheme flats, public housing units and government land sale. further, the government has also made known its intention to adopt suitable measures soon to stabilise the property market. all these will contribute positively to the local property market and will bring about a return of confidence to the value appreciation potential of local residential units. once the current excess inventories of completed units are absorbed by the market, there will be a promising outlook for the property market.
your group has much earlier on adopted a very conservative land replenishment strategy and this has brought about substantial reduction in the completion of projects in recent years, thereby greatly reducing the group s risk exposure over a period of continual decline in property price. the group is presently taking the advantage of the prevailing low property prices to acquire more development sites and has made further efforts to hasten up negotiations of land premium with the government on agricultural land conversions as well as applications for increase in plot ratios of the development sites. from now until the end of 2003, the total number of residential units that the group plans to launch in pre-sale of properties under construction and sale of completed properties will amount to around 9,500 units. the majority of these units are located in busy urban areas of good the group had made appropriate long term plans to increase its rental property portfolio which has resulted in an increase from a total of 2.9 million sq.ft. in attributable gross floor area in 1995 to approximately 7.9 million sq.ft. expected by the end of june, 2003. the group s recurrent income base will be strengthened substantially, since the group s rental properties, consisting mainly of large shopping centres in the new towns and grade a office properties in urban districts at the mass transit railway and mainline railway network, are able to maintain steady rental as well as high occupancy rates. the group s investments in hong kong and china gas, henderson china, hong kong ferry and miramar have all borne fruits in establishing a steady income base with sustainable growth prospect, as well as providing a sound foundation to allow the group to expand its business in mainland china and to diversify the group s business.
your group possesses abundant financial resources and can fully capture market opportunities that may arise for the expansion of the group s business.
as the group has already pre-sold a substantial portion of the major developments to be completed by the end of the current financial year, and as profits will also continue to be generated from the rental properties and the group s listed associates, it is anticipated that, in the absence of the unforeseen circumstances, the group s performance will show a steady lee shau kee
