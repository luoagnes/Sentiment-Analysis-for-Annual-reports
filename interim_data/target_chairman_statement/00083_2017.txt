sino heritage was established in 2011 with the belief that conservation of cultural heritage helps the community build a sense of identity and strengthen relationships in the city. sino heritage identifies and showcases the heritage significance of historical projects in both hong kong and singapore. in march 2008, the ng teng fong family, the major shareholder of the group, set up a nonprofit-making organisation, named hong kong heritage conservation foundation limited (hcf). hcf revitalised and converted the old tai o police station, a grade ii historic building, into a boutique hotel. named tai o heritage hotel (hotel), it is home to nine colonial-style rooms and suites, and commenced operation in march 2012. the hotel, operated by hcf as a non-profit-making social enterprise, is part of the hksar governments revitalising historic buildings through partnership scheme. the hotel was a winner of the 2013 unesco asiapacific awards for cultural heritage conservation.
following decades of export-oriented economic growth, china has established itself as the second largest economy and one of the key contributors in the process of globalisation. the creation of an economic and mutually beneficial trade route between asia and europe through the belt and road initiative can benefit asia, europe and many other nations. a successful belt and road initiative will go beyond infrastructure development and trade as it will help reduce poverty and regional economic disparity along the belt and road. china has taken the role to lead and manage the belt and road initiative since its inception in 2013, paving the way for the next stage of development. in may 2017, the first leaders roundtable of the belt and road forum for international co-operation was held in beijing which covered integration issues and the further development of economic partnership. many state leaders and over a thousand representatives attended the event indicating wide support internationally for the initiative. hong kong has a role to play in the belt and road. this year, president xi jinping visited hong kong for the first time as president of china, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the handover of sovereignty to china by the british government. during his visit, the president highlighted the benefits for hong kong to leverage its strengths and role in advancing the belt and road initiative and to cooperate with other core regions to capitalise on this opportunity.
the concept of the guangdong-hong kong-macau greater bay area (greater bay area) can be traced back to 2004 when the first strategic planning study named planning study on the coordinated development of the greater pearl river delta townships was proposed and completed in 2009. there have been much discussion and reports done since then. the development of the greater bay area is also supported by the 13th five-year plan and it covers 11 cities which are dongguan, foshan, guangzhou, hong kong, huizhou, jiangmen, macau, shenzhen, zhaoqing, zhongshan and zhuhai with a total area of over 56,000 square kilometers. the plan was also stated in the report of the central government by the premier of the state council in the fifth session of the 12th national peoples congress of the peoples republic of china in march 2017. establishing the greater bay area promotes the development of the metropolitan areas along pearl river delta region and is part of the nationwide urban agglomeration plan designed by the national development and reform commission. improvement in connectivity among cities can optimise their synergies and maximise economic potential of the cities.
