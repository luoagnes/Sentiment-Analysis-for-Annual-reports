the close economic partnership agreement between hong kong and prc (cepa) will afford a wide range of hong kong enterprises the opportunity of enjoying the benefits of complementary economic characteristics between the two economies. the increased levels of mutual cooperation between hong kong and the prc resulting from cepa are now beginning to produce results, thereby further enhancing the competitiveness of hong kong corporations and generating a higher level of wealth in the economy.
recent hksar government land auctions have also had a positive effect on the property market in hong kong, sending a signal for a solid and continuous growth. as to the future, growth is sustainable, economic fundamentals remain intact and the economic outlook is promising, with the group well positioned the group will continue its policy of selectively and continuously replenishing its land bank to optimise earnings and of improving the quality of its products and services so as to enhance the lifestyle for its customers. the group s acquisition of prime sites for its land bank will enable us to strengthen our earnings and profitability, and continue to deliver value to our shareholders.
