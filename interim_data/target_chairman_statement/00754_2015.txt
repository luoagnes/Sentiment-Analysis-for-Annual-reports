market environment and operation
1. overview of the economic environment in 2014, china s economy maintained a steady trajectory under the new norm and presented a positive trend with stable growth, optimized structure and enhanced quality. the gross domestic product (the gdp ) for the year was rmb63,646.3 billion, which grew 7.4% as compared to that of last year. of which, the increase in value of the tertiary industry was rmb30,673.9 billion, representing a year-on-year increase of 8.1%.
disposable income per capita of urban households was rmb28,844, representing a growth of 8.0% from the same period last year.
in 2015, stabilizing growth, adjusting structure remains the top priority for china s macroeconomic development. the central economic work conference has pointed out that china s economy is evolving into a stage featuring more complex division of labour and more reasonableness in structures. economic development has also entered into the new norm which marks the transition from high gear growth to medium-to- high gear growth, from scale and speed-based sprawling growth to quality and efficiency-based integrated growth, and from volume and capacity expansion as the main goal to an in-depth adjustment involving the co-existence of volume adjustment and capacity optimization. in short, the new norm will remain the overarching principle that guides china s economic development at the present moment and the days to 2. overview of real estate market in 2014, regulation for the real estate sector shifted from intense policy intervention to market-oriented adjustment, where policies remain relatively loose. in the second half of the year, measures such as the loosening of loan limits and disproportionate interest reduction have inspired confidence in the market and accelerated its rebound.
in general, the real estate sector made steady progress during the year.
the investment in real estate development across the country amounted to rmb9,503.6 billion, representing a year-on-year increase of 10.5%; the paid-in investment for the year of real estate developers was rmb12,199.1 billion, representing a year-on-year decrease of 0.1%; the area of commodity housing sold across the country reached 1,206.49 million sq.m., representing a year-on-year decrease of 7.6%; the sales of commodity housing across the country amounted to rmb7,629.2 billion, representing a year-on-year decrease of 6.3%; the area of land purchased by real estate developers was 333.83 million sq.m., representing a year-on-year decrease of 14.0%. at the end of 2014, the available-for-sale area of commodity housing across the country was 621.69 million sq.m., representing an increase of 26.1% from last year.
after nearly three years of in-depth adjustment for the real estate sector, much had changed in the industry s market and business landscape. on the whole, supply and demand for the market was reaching equilibrium while some cities even witnessed excess of supply over demand. a shift in demographic composition led to a more stable number of main consumer group. a new norm has likewise come into being for the real estate sector. although the industry saw a rebound at the end of 2014, it is unlikely that the market will experience growth both in quantity and price as before. we are of the opinion that in 2015, the market will slowly tread away from the gloom and regain a steady momentum.
we expect that under the general tendency to stabilize economic growth, the central government will continue to implement active fiscal policies and prudent monetary policies in 2015. meanwhile, policies regarding the real estate sector will remain relatively loose and inventory reduction will be the focal point for the industry s recovery. with regard to the above, we remain positive yet prudent in our efforts to analyze the market and progress steadily forward in the new norm of the real estate sector.

as the capital of china, not only is beijing the political, economic and cultural centre of the country but also a city of great prominence in the whole asia and the world. judging from its recent years of development, beijing s economy has come to influence wider areas with more penetrating value. regions such as heibei, shanxi and shandong have also become more closely coordinated with beijing in their economic development. in 2014, beijing s economy kept up a rapid pace, with gdp amounting to rmb2,133.1 billion, representing a year-on-year increase of 7.3%; disposable income per capita of urban households grew 8.9% to rmb43,910 as compared with the same period last year.
