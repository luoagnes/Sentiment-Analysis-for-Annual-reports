chairman s letter the cathay pacific group reported an attributable profit of hk$5,501 million for 2011.
this compares to the profit of hk$14,048 million for 2010, which was a record year for the group. the 2010 results included hk$3,033 million of significant non-recurring items being the profit on the sales of our shareholdings in hong kong air cargo terminals limited ( hactl ) and hong kong aircraft engineering company limited ( haeco ) and the gain on the deemed disposal of part of our interest in air china. adjusting for these items, the attributable profit in 2011 decreased by hk$5,514 million or 50.1% from 2010. earnings per share fell by 60.9% to hk139.8 cents. turnover for the year increased by 9.9% to hk$98,406 million.
in 2011 the core business of the cathay pacific group was materially affected by instability and uncertainty in the world s major economies. the passenger business of cathay pacific and dragonair held up relatively well mainly as a result of strong demand for premium class travel.
the cargo business was adversely affected by a substantial reduction in demand for shipments from our two key export markets, hong kong and mainland china.
fuel is our biggest single cost and the persistently high jet fuel prices had a significant effect on our operating results in 2011. disregarding the effect of fuel hedging, the group s gross fuel costs increased by hk$12,455 million (or 44.1%) in 2011. the increase reflected both higher fuel prices and the fact that we operated more flights. managing the risk associated with changing fuel prices remains a high priority. to this end we have an active fuel hedging programme. in 2011 we realised a profit of hk$1,813 million from fuel hedging activities, with unrealised mark-to-market gains of hk$436 million in the reserves at 31st december 2011.
passenger revenue for the year was hk$67,778 million, an increase of 14.2% compared with 2010. capacity increased by 9.2%. we carried a total of 27.6 million passengers, a rise of 2.9% compared with 2010. the load factor fell by 3.0 percentage points. yield increased by 8.7% to hk66.5 cents. the relative strength of a number of the currencies in which we receive revenues made a positive contribution to our revenues. demand for premium class travel remained robust in 2011. firm demand for business class seats on short-haul routes reflected the relative strength of the asian economy.
load factors in economy class remained generally high, particularly on the north american and southeast asian routes. however, there was a reduction in economy class yield on long-haul routes. business to and from japan was affected by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami which took place in march 2011. business to and from thailand was affected by the serious floods there in october and november.
cargo revenue for 2011 was up by 0.3% to hk$25,980 million compared with 2010. cargo business performed reasonably well in the first quarter of 2011. however, from april onwards, demand for shipments from our two most important markets, hong kong and mainland china, weakened significantly and remained weak for the rest of the year. we managed capacity in order to keep it in line with demand and continued to seek opportunities in new markets. yield was up by 3.9% to hk$2.42. capacity increased by 6.9%. the load factor, however, fell by 8.5 percentage points to 67.2%. in 2011 we started cargo services to bengaluru in india, chongqing and chengdu in western china and zaragoza in spain.
we continue to acquire new aircraft to replace older, less efficient aircraft and to increase the size of the fleet. in 2011, we took delivery of six boeing 777-300ers, three airbus a330-300s and four boeing 747-8f freighters. two new airbus a320-200s joined the dragonair fleet in february 2012. in march 2011, we announced orders for 27 new aircraft, including two airbus a350-900s (which had been ordered in december 2010), 15 airbus a330-300s and 10 boeing 777-300ers. in august 2011, we announced the acquisition of four more boeing 777-300ers and eight boeing 777-200f freighters. in january 2012, we announced the purchase of six more airbus a350-900s for delivery in 2016 and 2017 and agreed to lease two new airbus a320-200s to be delivered later in 2012. by 2019, we intend to be operating one of the youngest, most fuel-efficient wide- body passenger fleets in the world.
despite the current economic weakness, we have confidence in the long-term prospects of our cargo business and in hong kong s role as the world s leading international air cargo hub. in addition to bringing more efficient new freighters into the fleet we have eight boeing 777-200f freighters on order in addition to the 10 boeing 747-8f freighters referred to above we are also building our own cargo terminal. a topping-out ceremony to mark the completion of civil construction was held in november 2011. the terminal is expected to begin operations in early 2013.
during 2011, we have continued our efforts to improve the services which we provide to passengers. in march 2011, cathay pacific introduced its new business class seat. feedback from passengers has been very positive.
at the end of 2011, the new seats have been installed in 15 aircraft. in february 2012 we began installing new premium economy class cabins on our long-haul aircraft.
the new cabins are expected to be installed in 87 aircraft by 2013. the seats and service in the new cabins will be significantly better than those in economy class cabins.
we began to install new economy class seats on medium- and long-haul aircraft in march 2012. the level 6 business class lounge in the wing, cathay pacific s signature lounge at hong kong international airport, reopened in april 2011 after extensive refurbishment. the entire refurbishment of the wing (including the first class lounge) is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2012. we continued to develop the passenger network, launching two new cathay pacific routes in 2011 abu dhabi and chicago and increasing frequencies on other air china plays an increasingly important role in our business, having contributed 31.1% of our consolidated profit before tax in 2011. air china and cathay pacific continue to work together closely. the cargo joint venture with air china, in which cathay pacific owns an equity and an economic interest, was formally approved and established in february and officially launched in may 2011. the joint venture operates from shanghai under the air china cargo name.
cathay pacific joined other airlines, industry bodies and governments in opposing the european union s new emissions trading scheme (ets). introduced on 1st january 2012, ets is essentially a tax on carbon dioxide emissions flying into europe and unfairly penalise long-haul carriers. we believe that a global approach is needed for any emissions scheme in order to provide a level playing field for all airlines.
after a record year in 2010, we faced a number of major challenges in 2011: the instability of the global economy, the weakness of the air cargo market, the reduction of yields in economy class, the impact of natural disasters in japan and thailand, unrest in the middle east and continued high jet fuel prices. looking ahead, economic uncertainties have continued into the first half of this year - while these uncertainties continue, we expect pressure on economy class yields and our cargo business in particular to remain weak. fuel prices have risen further.
as a result, 2012 is looking even more challenging than 2011 and we are therefore cautious about prospects for this year. we will continue to be vigilant in managing our costs while not compromising the quality of our products and services or our long-term strategic investment in the business. our financial position remains strong. in august 2011, we established a medium term note programme.
the programme provides an additional source of funding and allows the company to issue debt in a range of currencies. the first issue of notes under the programme took place in october 2011. further notes were issued in january and february 2012.
the commitment and hard work of employees across the cathay pacific group and its subsidiary and associated companies are central to our continuing success. i take this opportunity to thank them.
