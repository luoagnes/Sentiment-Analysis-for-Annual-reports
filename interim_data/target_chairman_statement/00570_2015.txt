tianjiang pharmaceutical is the forerunner among all tcm manufacturers specializing in the research and development and production of concentrated tcm granules; with its role as leader in the industry, its revenue figure took up about 50% of the market share. the acquisition of tianjiang pharmaceutical enables the company an immediate entry into the concentrated tcm granules market and to hold a dominant position in the industry. at the same time, concentrated tcm granules are an important supplement to the tcm products that are currently manufactured by the company. it will also be a strong boost towards the companys goal of establishing itself as the leader of tcm industry.

endeavoring to be the leader of tcm industry
as the flagship company of china national pharmaceutical group corporation (cnpgc) in the chinese medicine sector, the companys goal is to establish itself as the leader of tcm industry in china.
the company will fully leverage on the strong brand of sinopharm to develop and flourish such historical and well- known brands as dezhong, fengliaoxing and tongjitang, with a view to establishing and strengthening the advantageous position held by the company in the market and the industry. the company possesses production approvals for more than 500 tcm and chemical drugs, including over 60 exclusive products and specifications. the company has 26 exclusive products which are listed on the national drugs list for basic medical insurance, among which, xianling gubao capsuletablet , yu ping feng granule , bi yan kang tablet , jingshu granule , moisturising & anti-itching capsule , fengshi gutong capsule and zaoren anshen capsule are exclusive products on the national essential drug list (2012 edition) (edl). the company has achieved healthy business growth in the past few years and is confident in maintaining such momentum.
the company has established its base in the chinese medicine sector and maintains a staunch stand in its strategy of organic growth and m&as. on the foundation of a sustainable growth of its existing tcm business and the entry into concentrated tcm granules market, the company will continue to seek for resources in the relevant sector in order to support the development in the above two businesses and to enhance the value chain of tcm manufacturing.
meanwhile, the company will explore entering into tcm service sector in accordance with the characteristics of tcm theory and practice, with a view to expanding its business scope and leveraging on its superior resources in the sector.
currently, with the complex economic conditions, there is an apparent slow-down in the growth of various industries, including healthcare. the ongoing change in government policy and the intense competition during the process of industry consolidation, together with the impact of new technology on the market, have increased uncertainties faced by pharmaceutical companies. however, the company has a firm soe-background with cnpgc being its controlling shareholder, while maintaining flexible and down-to-earth business strategies for a private enterprise. with established corporate governance mechanism and sustainable business model, as well as benefiting from the efficient capital market in hong kong, the company will be able to maintain continuous growth in its revenue size and profitability. the company will become the leader in chinas tcm industry and create value for all shareholders.
