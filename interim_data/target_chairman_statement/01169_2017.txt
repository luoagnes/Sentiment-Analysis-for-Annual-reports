in 2016, chinas economy stepped into a new normal and experienced industrial upgrading. under the innovationdriven growth strategy formulated at the beginning of 2016, we recorded a revenue of rmb63.85 billion and a record-high net profit attributable to owners of the company of rmb2.79 billion.
with our efforts in 2016, we witnessed an accelerating growth momentum and strengthened competitiveness across all business segments. our innovation and endeavor are recognised by customers. i will now present to all shareholders the performance of our business segments: 
positioning of the groups home appliances unit, which comprises washing machine and water heater business driven by users customised demands, we are now leading the industry standards and developing iots-based mass 
for the washing machine business, we successfully set a high standard of silence and gentle washing experience based on our product innovation and reputation building.
over the past two years, the most common pain point from washing machine users was the noise from washing and spinning. to minimise that, haiers washing machines have undergone several upgrades of the motors by replacing the belt drive motor with the direct drive motor so as to reduce vibration and reach utmost silence during its course of operation. furthermore, our new 6-point balanced vibration absorbing system, which was inspired by the suspension system of sport cars, offers users extremely quiet washing experience. after identifying and addressing the pain points of users with technological solutions, we have also demonstrated the silence of haiers washing machines through marketing functions such as towering coins on spinning machines and silence competition since september 2016, thereby defining an unprecedented standard for silence in consumers mind.
with the concept of healthy living, more and more chinese families realised that sharing washing machine to wash underwear, coat and clothes might not be the ideal washing solution. in view of this, haier launched haier twins model, the worlds first washing machine with an innovative dual-drum design that allows clothes to be washed in two separate drums simultaneously. the launch of this model realised customers dream of combining two washing machines into one and has become the priority for high-end consumers.
all of the examples above are a testament to our ability to constantly obtain, and will continue to obtain more market share in chinese washing machine market.
while maintaining our no.1 position in terms of sales volume in the chinese electronic water heater market, we strove to develop our gas and new-energy water heater businesses to cater to users demand on energy-saving and environmental protection. electronic water heaters are the groups traditional core products. our patented safe care technology has been commonly used in the chinese water heater industry. our water heaters have been continuously innovated and upgraded to be equipped with new features such as rapid heating-up, energy-saving and 
in 2016, revenue from gas water heaters increased by more than 40%. the increase was mainly attributable to the groups deep insight in consumers pain points and the trust from users with industry leading science and technology practitioners. the group cooperated with honeywell and tsinghua university and jointly developed a co gas monitoring and warning system. by collaborating university of science and technology of china, the group developed a technology for co emission reduction, which was granted the scientific and technological progress award by the china national light industry council. this technology addressed consumers concerns about emission safety of gas water heaters. the group has gone further to work together with china academy of space technology (the cast), and apply the advanced technology of aerospace power to develop a highly efficient and energy-saving 
during the period of national 13th five-year plan, the plan for solar-thermal industry was changed with its development focus shifting from non-connected home appliances to the utilisation of large-scale systems integrating multiple forms of energy. to cater to the solar industry trend, the groups solar water heater business is positioned as a solar energy service provider with the capabilities of system design, manufacturing and installation to undertake large-scale solar thermal project.
channel services business
positioning of the channel services business firstly, through technology enabled channel management, we supported franchisees in realising the fast-in-fast-out business model. secondly, we eliminated the partitions among the channels and realigned different channels to create end-to-end experience to increase user loyalty and interaction 
a vast majority of the groups distribution business is operated under the haier brand name. this business segment conducts online distribution business, which includes the sales of haier products through b-to-c e-commerce platforms such as tmall and jd.com and online sales of haier products through haiers official website. apart from online sales, it also conducts offline b-to-b business such as electrical appliance flagship stores and franchise stores.
since the first half of 2016, we have formulated a plan to unify haiers distribution business channels, re-structured the channel management team by coordinating product managers and channel managers, and addressed the issues arising from product assortment and pricing in different channels, which contributed to the increase in efficiency of supply chain management and profitability of channel partners. having streamlined the channel, both of haiers online and offline distribution businesses recorded a rapid growth. in 2016, sales from haiers online distribution business for the third and fourth quarters increased by more than 50% and 60% period-on-period, respectively, while the sales from offline distribution business for the third and fourth quarters increased by double digits period-on-period, respectively. this sales performance was achieved along with the optimisation of inventory of our distributors. during 2016, inventory turnover speed of haiers franchisees doubled.
leveraging our logistics system and distribution system across the third and fourth tier cities and rural areas in china, we provided our distributors with fast-in-fast-out channel management services, including product planning, order management, marketing and promotion, sales and support, membership management, rebate management and transaction settlement. in 2016, capitalising on the jushanghui () management platform developed by haier group, the entire ordering process of our franchisees can now be 100% managed online. franchisees can place orders and obtain product and marketing resources through the jushanghui platform. all of their needs can be submitted and fulfilled through the management platform. with its transparent and real-time interactive operational model, management efficiency and satisfactory level of our franchisees have been substantially enhanced. in 2016, the average number of franchisees trading through the jushanghui platform reached 17,000 per day, and the number of users visiting the platform reached 7.41 million per month.
in the mobile internet era, sales from physical stores of the franchisees experiences certain challenges. as more and more customers opt for searching, comparing price and trading online, there has been a reduced number of customers visiting physical stores. along with the capital expenditure incurred for opening up a store, our franchisees businesses are now under unignorable challenge. i believe the solution to this issue is to accelerate the transformation of the operational model of the franchise stores, increase investment in mobile technology, give full support to the distributors for obtaining user resources across all channels, and create, on an ongoing basis, a highly efficient channel for exchange of user experiences and values.
our self-developed mobile app shunguang () for channel management system was widely applied in 2016.
shunguang connects the online and offline product databases and enables every single store to sell products that are not kept in the store but within the whole network of distribution warehouses. shunguang encourages individuals to run their own online shops round-the-clock and turn all of their friends to be sales partners. shunguang is also a transparent management platform connecting consumers, micro-enterprise owners and partners, and enables consumers to participate in product customisation and interaction. shunguang amassed 350,000 micro-enterprise owners to date and achieved a trading amount of rmb1.12 billion in 2016.

looking into 2017, i remain optimistic about the prospects of the white goods, distribution and logistics businesses.
the domestic consumption market will continue to grow and upgrade. according to the national statistics, nominal and real wage per capita in china grew by 8.4% and 6.3%, respectively, over the past year. meanwhile, real estate prices in many first and second tier cities in china increased by more than 5 times in the past 10 years, while the consumption amount on home appliances per capita did not record any significant increase. this is expected to be changed because on the demand-side, chinese consumers consumption power and willingness to spend on highquality and smart home appliances are increasing, and on the supply side, there has been an increasing supply of high quality products and well-designed home appliances products sold in china that match or even exceed developed countries standards. further, the acceleration of urban-rural integration narrowed the gap between rural and urban area in terms of consumption preferences, with a growing number of rational consumers who prefer higher-quality and branded products.
the positioning of haiers products is to take advantages of international-leading technology and produce home appliances that exceed customers expectation. in 2017, our growth would outpace that of the industrys based on our focus on details valued by our customers and our leading position within the industry.
though the chinese economic growth is transitioning into a normal rate, the quality growth will bring the industry new opportunities for transformational upgrade. rules in china have become more transparent and fair, which has created a better business environment for enterprises that pursue industrial upgrading. with the strict implementation of environmental regulations since 2016, enterprises that failed to meet the standards would drop out. under the new advertisement law, false or exaggerated promotion would be strictly prohibited. the implementation of road traffic management by the ministry of transportation would strictly prohibit overloading or over-height vehicles from using highway, and so it would facilitate logistics enterprises to compete fairly. as a brand enterprise that has been strictly adhering to regulations, haier will be a key beneficiary from the industry upgrading.
haier is a reputable enterprise with three decades of history. in spite of fluctuations of the economic cycle, the company has grown to be the worlds top white goods company. we have stuck to a few business principles over the years. first, as a consumer goods manufacturer, our fate is tied with consumers closely. as quality of our products is defined by users, we therefore designed washing machines that are noise-free and cloth-friendly. the reputation of our logistics and distribution services are also based on users comments, which we have adopted as the major performance indicator in evaluating the logistics department.
second, we continue to innovate. due to the intense competition in chinas household appliance industry, we must differentiate ourselves and must not be trapped into any price wars that are commonly seen. further, we must not follow our competitors footsteps or engage in competition on homogenous products. our persistence in innovation is attributable to two spirits. one is self-doubting, meaning that we dare to falsify our business practice that proved to be successful in the past. the second is having an open-mind to collaboration. our product innovation platform, hope.haier.com, is open to the world, which has established a resource network comprising more than 2 million parties, of which more than 100,000 have already registered on the platform. through this platform, more than 500 innovative ideas have been generated through communication and interaction every month, and more than 200 innovative items are incubated every year.
third, we uphold the culture that aligns the interests of the company and its employees mode and maintain the vitality of the organization. first of all, haier abandoned the traditional hierarchy whereby employees are promoted based on their seniority and salaries are tied to positions held. in our mind, if one fails to create user value, heshe deserves low-level of compensation from the company regardless of his seniority. in haier, the value of employees who establish entrepreneurship internally can be fully recognised. in our organisation, employees who operate a micro-enterprise are no longer passive employees who receive orders, instead, they are entrepreneurs and partners who can mobilise internal resources of the company for their own use, such as financial resources supports and administrative services. lastly, we made a breakthrough with regard to the conventional remuneration framework.
in haier, incentives for employees are not limited to basic salary but are completely linked to the value they created.
there is no limitation for middle-level management to receive equity interests of the company. with the above initiatives, the culture that aligns the interests of the company and its employees will be continually reinforced.
our upholding of the above-mentioned principles will be crucial for us to balance between long-term development goal and short-term operations, to meet high-level operating standards and to establish a fair assessment system. in 2017 we will continue to stick to the principles, and only by doing so can we continue to succeed and create value for our shareholders.
