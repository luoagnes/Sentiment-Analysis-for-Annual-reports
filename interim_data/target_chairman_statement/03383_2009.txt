the global fi nancial tsunami has resulted in a grim economic environment across all countries. china s economy has also been adversely affected, with many industries badly hit. to cope with the challenging economic environment, the central government launched a series of economic stimulus measures, with a view to boosting domestic demand so as to maintain a steady and relatively rapid economic growth. as the backbone of the national economy, the real estate industry was the government s focus. during the year, the government stepped up its efforts in the construction of protection-type housing.
it also strengthened the guidance and supervision on investment and development of commodity housing to safeguard the steady growth of the industry as a whole.
meanwhile, in order to mitigate the negative impact of the fi nancial tsunami on the real estate industry, the central government introduced various measures to stimulate the property market in the fourth quarter, while fi nancing credits control was relaxed to promote rational development of the industry in the long-run. however, as the global fi nancial crisis persists, it is expected that an upturn of the domestic economy is not likely to happen in the short term, and the business environment will be even more complicated and variable.
in the face of the market challenge, the group has experienced a sales slowdown in some of its projects when compared with the same period of last year. in order to cope with the challenges brought about by these changes, the group has promptly adjusted its development and sales plans and formulated fl exible strategies. accordingly, the group further optimised its product mix and design, adjusted some of the unit prices and adopted a fl exible sales strategy to speed up sales. such measures were met with satisfactory market response.

despite the persistent diffi culties doggies in the domestic and overseas macroeconomic environments and the volatile property market in china; various economic stimulus measures and policies formulated by the prc government in response to the situation have started to pay off and a rational growth trend of the property market has resumed. i am of the view that, with the maturing market competition mechanism, under which the fittest survives, the property market will become more stable and grow steadily, which will create a favourable operating environment for large-scale property developers with a sound footing and integrated strength, including agile.
i believe that the property prices have returned to a reasonable level after this wave of adjustments.
