as the largest containerboard manufacturer in asia. nd paper has grasped opportuni? es arising from the industry recovery and recorded progressive growth in its business results and steady opera? ons by leveraging on its robust strength and visionary on behalf of nine dragons paper (holdings) limited and its subsidiaries, i hereby present the annual results for the 12 months ended 30 june 2010 (the year ). on behalf of the board, i would also like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all shareholders and friends from various communities for their care extended to reviewing the past year, as a result of the gradual recovery of the global economy, the paper industry also recovered from its trough at the end of 2008 but was faced with the european sovereign credit crisis and the prc tightening property measures during the second quarter of 2010. although such two factors did not have a direct impact on the domestic demand for packaging paperboard products in china, the market became cautious and conservative in the short term, which caused a small impact on the group s sales volume. nevertheless, driven by the continuous efforts of the prc government to stimulate domestic demand and the continued improvement of standards of living among prc people, the demand for packaging paperboard products from various sectors will remain increasingly buoyant. as the largest containerboard manufacturer in asia, nd paper has grasped opportunities arising from the industry recovery and recorded progressive growth in its business results and steady operations by leveraging on its robust strength and visionary development strategies. it also actively expanded its production capacity to fulfill the increasing products demand from various market regions in order to fully unleash its future profit potential. at present, the group has a total design production capacity of 8.82 million tpa. domestic sales continued to grow steadily, accounting for 83.9% of the total sales. it is expected that the total design production capacity of the group will exceed 10 million tpa by june 2011, making it the largest packaging paperboard manufacturer in the world, which represents a new milestone in the course of the group s development.
in face of the fluctuations in recovered paper prices in the international market, the group maintained its recovered paper inventory at reasonably low levels which was enabled by the close cooperation among its procurement, logistics and production functions. at the same time, the group accelerated and increased the purchase volume of domestic recovered paper. as a result, the group has strengthened its ability of passing recovered paper price fluctuations to its customers in a timely manner, and achieved steady profit growth.
during the year, domestic recovered paper accounted for approximately 23% of the group s recovered paper purchase, with taicang base achieving 27% and over 50% in chongqing and tianjin bases already.
as the market continues to mature and domestic demand growth is sustained, the purchase volume of domestic recovered paper will be increased each year according to the prices between domestic and imported recovered paper. it is expected that the proportion of domestic recovered paper purchased by the group will exceed 30% by the end of 2010.
for exports, due to the temporary slowdown in the economic recovery in europe and the us and market uncertainties, the group will adopt a prudent but positive attitude, making use of its leading industry position to seize market opportunities, in order to further enhance the group s performance when improvements in the export market become more apparent.
focus on environmental protection and the opportunities arising from industry consolidation while our scale continues to expand and our leading position is becoming increasingly solid, the group has been actively pursuing its environmental protection endeavour. china attached high importance to environmental protection, energy conservation and emission reduction. the targets of phasing out over 4 million tpa of non-compliant paper production capacity by the end of september 2010, and carbon emission reduction by 40%-45% by 2020 have been clearly stated by the government. a series of measures have been adopted to encourage the integration of enterprises and the closure of non-compliant medium- and small-sized paper manufacturers so as to improve the overall disciplines of the industry. owing to the government s determination to implement various energy-saving, emission reduction and production restriction measures, market consolidation is expected to accelerate significantly. the substantial sales volume increase of the group observed in july and august 2010 reflected the effects of such market consolidation driven by the environmental policies of the prc government.
