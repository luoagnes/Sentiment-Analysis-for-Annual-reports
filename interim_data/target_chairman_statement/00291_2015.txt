the group has a successful track record with joint venture partners. we believe that the group can leverage the advanced technology and superb experience of its partners to capture business opportunities. in the short-to-medium term, the profitability of the group will be affected by (i) china s anti- extravagance policy, (ii) the competition from e-commence businesses, and (iii) the integration process with tesco s china operation. although the profitability of the group is expected to be volatile, gradual recovery should begin to be felt in the short- to-medium term and the joint venture with tesco will assist in the group s long term prospects and will further strengthen our competitive advantage in our retail operation. the group s beer business established a solid foundation over the last two decades.
the present scale was established under occasional unfavourable macro factors such as competition, extended cool weather and high raw material costs. the track record proves that the business is able to maintain good balance between growth and profitability over the medium and long term. the rice business within the food division has also affected the group s results. the rice business is still at the initial investment stage for national expansion, and we believe that it will create value in future. confronted with a fast changing business environment, particularly in china s retail sector, the group believes that improving asset return is vital for its long term development. the group will not only focus on enhancing profitability, but will also try to release more value from the operation and generate the best return to all stakeholders.
