looking back over the year 2001, the company s performance amid such severe market conditions was mainly reflected in the following areas: firstly, with the global economic downturn, the fall in the international prices of crude oil was larger than expected, in particular after "9.11" incident; secondly, a serious distortion of prices occurred in the market of refined oil products in singapore; from june to august in 2001, the prices of crude oil abnormally exceeded the prices of gasoline in the singapore market. with the prices of domestic refined oil products directly linked to singapore s market prices for similar grade of refined oil products, the company suffered a significant reduction in refining margin in the second half of the year. thirdly, as the pricing mechanism for refined oil products in china has not been well developed and the market was not mature, supply of refined oil products in certain areas of the prc exceeded demand; in addition, disorderly competition arose in the refined products market, particularly in the wholesale sector. fourthly, with the slowdown in the global economy market and the sluggishness in the change of cycle for chemical products, prices of these products remained in a slump and continued to slip. domestic prices of chemical products fell accordingly, and compared with 2000, the average prices for principal chemical products fell by as much as 18.5%, which greatly exceeded the fall in prices of feedstocks. under such severe market conditions, immense pressure was exerted on the company in achieving its facing these difficulties, the company spared no efforts in taking steps to tackle the situation. the company was proactive in approaching the state regulators to improve the external market environment. at the same time, the company was flexible in adjustment of its business operations and actively coordinated among the various parties involved in an effort to balance the supply and demand in the domestic market. by reducing internal costs and expanding the market externally on one hand, and restructuring its organization and intensifying the reforms on the other, the company firmly carried out its long- term development strategy.

in 2001, the operating environment of the company improved. with a view to correcting the drawbacks in the pricing mechanism for refined oil products, the company made good efforts to draw the attention of the relevant governmental authorities to the matter, whilst it also helped the government put forward proposals and reach solutions. with the support of the relevant governmental authorities, a new pricing mechanism for refined oil products came into force on 17 october 2001. the new pricing mechanism brought the domestic refined oil products more closely linked to the international markets and further enhanced corporate autonomy, thus the company was better enabled to respond to market changes.
in 2001, the company continued to implement its four major strategies, being expanding resources, expanding markets, reducing costs and disciplining investments , and satisfactory results g expanding resources: in 2001, the company paid rmb 6.446 billion for the acquisition of sinopec national star, thereby increasing its upstream exploration strength and overall risk resistance ability. production of crude oil and natural gas in 2001 was 296.34 mmboe, representing an increase of 13.64% over the previous year, and 367.5 mmboe of crude oil and natural gas were added to the company s proved reserves, achieving a larger than 100% replacement ratio on the company s reserves for five consecutive years.
g expanding markets: with a view to expanding the markets for refined oil products, the company continued to acquire, construct and renovate petrol stations, resulting in 3,803 additional petrol stations in 2001. it optimized the allocation of refined oil products resources and improved its business operation. the total sales volume of refined oil products in the prc in 2001 was 67.74 million tonnes, of which the retail volume was 30.43 million tonnes, and the direct sales volume was 11.64 million tonnes.
the direct sales volume and the retail volume comprised 62.1% of the total sales volume. the company had a market share of 65% in respect of the retail sales volume in its principal market.
the throughput of crude oil was set at an appropriate level based on market conditions.
in 2001, the company s throughput of crude oil was 101.42 million tonnes. with a view to expanding the chemical products market, the chemical products structure was further adjusted to increase the proportion of higher g reducing costs: in 2001, the company achieved its targets to reduce costs, as it had committed to. costs for the year were reduced by rmb 2.281 billion, which exceeded the original target of rmb 2.19 billion. moreover, the company reduced the number of its employees by 68,000 in 2001 and paid an amount of approximately rmb 2.546 billion as expenses for employee reduction. the company estimates that approximately rmb 1.57 billion in labour costs could be saved each year hereafter.

looking forward to the year 2002, the global economy will, despite it has begun to recover, continue to face many uncertainties. meanwhile, the prc will continue to see a promising upward trend in economic development. as for the company, challenges will come and so will opportunities. in respect of the international market, it is estimated that the international average prices for crude oil will lag behind those in 2001; as there is an excess in refining capacity in the region and in view of the uncertainties in global economic development, demand for refined oil products and refining margins will also be uncertain in the future. it is estimated that the chemical industry will remain in a trough of the cycle in 2002; however, recovery is likely to gradually gain momentum. in respect of the domestic market, 2002 is the first year after china s accession to the world trade organization, and tariffs will be reduced and markets will be opened up. these measures will definitely have an impact on the company s operations. while the company is contemplating the severity of the situation, it has also noted the bright side which will help the company in its increased efforts in reforms and in the speeding up of development. firstly, the national economic growth of china is on the fast track of rising. in 2002, china will continue with its policy to stimulate the domestic demand, and implement proactive financial policies and prudent monetary policies, whilst growth in gdp is expected to reach approximately 7%. as such, there will be room for growth in demand for domestic refined oil products and chemical products, and hence it is possible that the company s total production will be expanded. secondly, as the government continues to press for setting an orderly market for refined oil products, it will create a favourable environment in which the company could compete in a regulated and orderly manner.
thirdly, the company will be further benefited from the results from its reforms and development. with the company s experience gained from its operations under market forces, the results arising from the reduction of employees, the newly added capacity through investment and achievements in technological advancement, new areas of growth will arise to help revenues grow and lower expenses as costs will be reduced and efficiency will be enhanced.
fourthly, china s accession to the wto not only brings forth challenges for the company, but also new opportunities. after joining the wto, consumption of motor vehicles in china is expected to rise, together with the expected expected growth of the textile industry, further impetus to the demand is expected in chemical products and refined oil products, particularly in the retail market. they present opportunities for the company s expansion. at the same time, a more liberal market environment will help the company access foreign capital, state-of-the-art technologies and management skills, which in turn will enhance the company s competitiveness.
to overcome the difficulties presented in the upcoming operating environment and to turn any challenge presented by china s entry to wto into opportunity and to turn opportunities into the company s advantages and profits, the company will continue to carry out the followings aspects of work under the principle of maximizing return on capital employed (roce): g endeavoring to improve external environment.
