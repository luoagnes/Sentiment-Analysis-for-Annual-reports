the chinese economy managed a relatively stable growth of 7.8% amid the complicated and challenging international economic condition in 2012. in view of the austerity policy from the central government and market uncertainties, the real estate industry has been facing increasing operating pressure. in general, the real estate market regained momentum after a contraction during the year. the market remained sluggish due to the effects arising from the austerity policy in the first half year, yet mass demand and a recovery in liquidity pushed up both transaction price and volume in the second half year. the real estate industry recorded an increase of approximately 10% in total sales as compared with the previous year.
the chinese government remained insisting on the promotion of economic transition and facilitated the implementation of policies in relation to domestic demand. as compared with the previous year, the total retail sales of consumer goods for the year increased by approximately 14%, representing a faster growth than the overall economic development. during the period under review, powerlong analysed government policies and market trend in an active manner. by successfully seizing market pace, the group recorded contracted sales of approximately rmb6,519 million, representing an increase of 18.9% over the previous year. rental income and property management fee income achieved rmb508 million, representing an increase of 78.9% over last year, due to active promotion of commercial operations. the overall operating results improved to a large extent.
