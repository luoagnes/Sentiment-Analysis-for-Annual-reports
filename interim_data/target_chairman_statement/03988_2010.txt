at the start of 2009, the international financial crisis was continuing to spread throughout the global economy. in response, the major economies cut and maintained benchmark interest rates at historical lows while actively implementing various economic stimulus plans. step by step, confidence returned to global financial markets and the world economy began to recover. the government maintained a proactive fiscal policy and a moderately easy monetary policy, continually optimising its economic stimulus package in response to new developments. as a result, the national economy experienced a strong rebound.
in the face of such unprecedented challenges and opportunities, the bank has continued to take a scientific approach to development. we have comprehensively implemented our new strategic development plan and earnestly promoted our working guidelines of scaling up, optimising structure, building brand, strengthening infrastructure, slashing cost and sharpening competitiveness . this approach has positively impacted the bank s business development and risk management, sharpened our competitiveness and continuously enhanced our business results.
in the past year, the scale and structure of the bank s assets and liabilities were further expanded and optimised. the bank s major businesses enlarged their market shares significantly. we further enhanced our restructuring campaign, including the currency and term structure of our investment portfolio, which led to improved operational efficiency. overseas operations revived their growth momentum and contributed a larger share in the group s total income.
our it blueprint project achieved a milestone with its successful launch at the hebei branch. during the year, in a step towards promoting business restructuring with a customer-centric service approach, we established a dedicated financial markets unit. we also began to consolidate the bank s risk management function by planning to establish the risk management unit, with a view to enhancing unified risk management.
the bank s brand image has been further enhanced, with the bank recognised as bank of the year 2009 (china) by the british magazine the banker.
in 2009, the bank further strengthened its corporate governance mechanism. drawing upon the lessons of the global financial crisis, the board played an active role in designing the bank s strategic development plan in line with the bank s prevailing conditions.
the board also actively guided the bank to prevent systemic risk, improve decision-making in a scientific manner and fulfil its corporate social responsibilities.
as a result, the bank won the excellent board of directors 2009 award granted by the shanghai stock exchange, the only awardee among the large-sized commercial banks in china.
i would like to thank the outgoing mr. liu ziqiang, chairman of the board of supervisors, for his valuable contributions to the bank in the past years, and extend a warm welcome to mr. li jun as his successor.
