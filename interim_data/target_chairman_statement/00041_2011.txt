champion reit is a real estate investment trust formed to own and invest in an income-producing portfolio of commercial properties primarily in asia.
currently, champion reit owns approximately 2.2 million sq. ft. of grade a office space and 650,000 sq. ft. of prime retail space in hong kong.
the trust s assets are located in citibank plaza, in central on hong kong island and langham place, an integrated project in the commercial district of mongkok, on the income from champion reit as mentioned at the beginning of this management s discussion and analysis, due to the reclassification of our investment in champion reit as an associate company from 23 july 2010, the share of results from champion reit from 23 july 2010 were included in the group s statutory profit. in addition, given this is a transitional year, distributions received over the second half of 2009 and first half of 2010 were also included. however, to provide the same basis for comparison, the group s core profit is based on dividend received from champion reit, which is consistent with past practices.
due to the group s accounting policy of recognizing distribution income from champion reit at the date of payment of the distribution, the income statement of the group for a six-month period reflects the distribution declared by the champion reit for the immediately preceding six-month period. therefore the income statement for 2010 recognised the distributions made by champion reit for the second half of 2009 and the first half of 2010. on that basis, distribution income from champion reit increased by 3.1% year-on-year to hk$597.0 million.
on the other hand, management fee income from champion reit decreased 2.7% year-on-year from hk$269.3 million in 2009 to hk$261.9 million in 2010, reflecting a decline in asset management fee in line with the lower net property income at citibank plaza.

there was a recovery in the office leasing market in central in 2010 as financial institutions gradually reversed their trend of downsizing. the arrival of a significant number of fund management companies to capitalize on china investment opportunities, together with the supporting legal trade, generated substantial demand. however, occupancy rate at citibank plaza decreased from 87.6% at the beginning of the year to 81.5% as at the end of 2010, because of earlier competition from some other landlords who offered long- term fixed-rate leases at relatively low rents. passing rental rates (the average rental rate of existing contracted tenancies) at citibank plaza weakened in the first half of 2010 but stabilized at the hk$84-85 per sq. ft. level for the langham place office tower leasing conditions for the offices at langham place have been stable. the office tower had a slightly higher occupancy rate of 99.4% as of 31 december 2010, as compared to 98.5% a year ago. this was notwithstanding the expiry of 35% of leases by floor area during the year and the strong price competition from new supply in the peripheral districts in kowloon east. langham place s mtr location and the outstanding quality of the building have been important factors in retaining tenants and maintaining a high occupancy. for 2010, passing rents were stable and continued to remain within a narrow range centered around hk$26.50 per sq. ft.
langham place mall despite the opening of a few new shopping malls in nearby tsim sha tsui, the convenient location of the langham place mall, its attractive shop offerings and its well conceived and executed marketing programmes ensured its status as one of the most popular shopping malls in kowloon, among local shoppers and tourists alike. the mall enjoyed very high levels of foot traffic and remained virtually fully let throughout 2010. driven by a constantly improving mix of quality retailers and a robust retail market, the average sales per sq. ft. of the shops in the mall improved by 18% year on year. the surge in spending by mainland tourists, who now consider langham place one of their favourite destinations, on cosmetics and fashion has also been a major factor behind the growth. the average passing rent rate increased from hk$88.61 per sq. ft. at the beginning of 2010 to hk$97.48 at year-end.

great eagle centre the lack of new supply in the wanchai area, the relocation of cost-sensitive tenants from central, coupled with strong demand from the service sector and mainland chinese companies have kept the office portion of great eagle centre at close to full occupancy throughout 2010. with the strong occupancy, we were able to progressively raise spot rents through 2010 from the high hk$40 s per sq. ft. at the beginning of the year to high hk$50 s towards the end of as the leases due for renewal in 2010 had been written during the last peaks of 2007 and 2008, when market rents were higher than those of 2010, there was therefore a small amount of negative rent rate reversion in 2010. average passing rent at great eagle centre at the end of december 2010 was 2% lower than that achieved at the beginning of the year. however, gross rental income increased by 4.2% year-on-year to hk$105.5 million in 2010 due to the higher average occupancy, as well as full year rental income contribution from an anchor tenant whose lease was renewed at a higher rental rate than its previous lease in the second quarter of 2009.
net rental income rose 13.9% year-on-year to hk$102.2 million due to lower vacancy costs and a lower base for comparison, as net rental income in 2009 was impacted by booking of additional expenses related to the relocation and upgrading of the cooling water pumping facilities.

united states properties all of our three properties in the u.s. have maintained their high occupancy levels throughout 2010 through renewal and new lettings, despite the sluggish demand for office space from the corporate sector in the area. overall occupancy for the portfolio stood at 90% as at the end of 2010, whereas average rent rate achieved came in steady at us$36.4 per sq. ft for 2010. with full year rental income contribution from tenants secured in 2009 and higher occupancy at the sacramento property, gross rental income for our u.s. properties increased by 3.1% year-on-year to hk$117.7 million in 2010. however, due to increased tenant inducement costs associated with the new lettings at 500 ygnacio and 2700 ygnacio, net rental income declined by 7.8% year-on-year to hk$46.7 million in 2010.

gross debts denominated in hk dollars amounted to hk$1,316 million as of 31 december 2010. our foreign currency gross debts as of 31 december 2010 amounted to the equivalent of hk$2,168 million, of which the equivalent of hk$499 million, or 23.0% of our foreign currency debts, was on fixed-rate basis. net of cash and bank deposits that matures within 3 months totalling the equivalent of hk$1,553 million, our consolidated net debt outstanding as of 31 december 2010 was hk$1,931 million, an decrease of hk$661 million from that of hk$2,592 million as of 31 because of the persistent low interest rate environment and in order to enhance return to shareholders, as a normal treasury function the group has been prudently investing in quality short-term bonds which are intended to be held to maturity, and full principal protected structured deposits and notes with reputable banks and financial institutions as counter-parties. as at 31 december 2010, investment in these bonds, structured deposits and notes amounted to hk$308 million. should this amount be taken into account, the consolidated net borrowing of the group would be reduced to hk$1,623 million.
equity attributable to shareholders, based on professional valuation of the group s investment properties as of 31 december 2010 and the depreciated costs of the group s hotel properties, amounted to hk$28,764 million as of 31 december 2010. the net assets value at 31 december 2010 represents an increase of hk$6,447 million compared to the value of hk$22,317 million as of 31 december 2009, mainly attributable to the profit for the year, and the equity account for the group s investment in champion reit units with effect from 23 july 2010. based on the consolidated net debt of hk$1,931 million, the resulting gearing ratio at 31 december 2010 was 7%. should the investment in bonds, structured deposits and notes mentioned above be recognized in the calculation, the gearing ratio will be reduced to 6%.

during the year, market interest rate has remained at an extremely low level. coupled with the high interest income from the group s investment in champion reit convertible bonds, the group has earned a net interest income of hk$52 million for the year. consequently, there is no applicable interest cover ratio as at the balance sheet dates.
liquidity and debt maturity profile as of 31 december 2010, our cash, bank deposits and committed but undrawn loan facilities amounted to a total of hk$3,197 million. the majority of our loan facilities is short or medium term in nature and is secured by properties with sufficient value to loan coverage. the following is a profile of the maturity of our outstanding debts as of 31 december 2010: within 1 year 22.9% 1-2 years 73.5% 3-5 years 3.6% pledge of assets at 31 december 2010, properties of the group with a total carrying value of approximately hk$9,615 million (31 december 2009: hk$9,895 million), were mortgaged or pledged to secure credit facilities granted to its subsidiaries.
commitments and contingent liabilities as at 31 december 2010, the group has authorised capital expenditures not provided for in these financial statements amounting to approximately hk$74 million (31 december 2009: hk$309 million) of which approximately hk$70 million (31 december 2009: hk$309 million) was contracted for.
as at 31 december 2010, the group has outstanding financial commitment of rmb180 million (equivalent to hk$211 million) for capital injection to a jointly controlled entity, and commitment of rmb233 million (equivalent to hk$275 million) for construction cost to complete a hotel property owned by an associate.
in addition to the above, as at 31 december 2010 the group has provided a several corporate guarantee and a charge over its interest in the share capital of an associate to a bank in respect of its share, i.e us$19.5 million of total banking facility of us$117 million granted to an associate.
other than set out above, the group did not have any significant commitments and contingent liabilities as at 31 in 2011, our businesses should benefit from the generally positive outlook of the economies in hong kong and china.
up to now, arrivals of affluent chinese travellers from the mainland have shown no signs of slowing down. corporate travel will also be supported by robust economic activities in the region. our hong kong hotels should perform well under these circumstances. however as all three hotels are already operating at or near their peak occupancy levels, the driver for revpar growth in 2011 will have to come mainly from further increases in room rates.
after completion of its overhaul in 2010, the langham london has successfully repositioned itself among the leading luxury hotels in central london. in a stable economic environment, there should be room for further gains in its occupancy and room rates in the coming year.
the outlook for our hotels in australia and new zealand should also be stable in view of the favourable economic situations over there. for our hotels in the united states, while we anticipate the demand for rooms may be constrained by the relatively slow pace of economic recovery, there should be some modest improvement in their performance in 2011. capital constraints of the last several years will lead to lower completions of new hotels in the united states. this could provide the platform for more meaningful revpar growth for our u.s. hotel in the following the trend of increasing occupancy and escalating rent rates in the central office market will be favourable to champion reit in the coming year. citibank plaza, its biggest asset, is located in central where no large grade-a office developments are scheduled for completion. while the property carried a 18.5% vacancy at the beginning of 2011, more than half of the existing vacant area will see tenant occupation before mid 2011, based on contracts already signed. together with the steady income contribution from langham place office tower and langham place mall, revenue for the champion reit s will likely show an improvement over 2010. however, distributions of champion reit will depend on a number of factors, including the level of interest expense upon refinancing of the debt on the citibank plaza property in may 2011.
thus far, the growth in the local economy has been robust.
however, the growth has been in part driven by the vast amount of liquidity in the system, and in part by the exceptional growth in mainland tourist arrivals. hong kong s economy is now inextricably tied to the state of the china economy. under the threat of rising inflation, the central government will introduce more control measures, including the gradual raising of rmb interest rates. any subsequent cool down in the china economy could negatively affect the prospects of hong kong. we are mindful of these risks and their potential impact on our businesses in the region.
with regard to new investments, development opportunities in mainland china remain high on our agenda, especially mixed-use development projects that generally generate higher financial returns. economic growth in mainland china is amongst the fastest in the world, where increasing urbanization and rising incomes will support property price growth in the long term. that should offer a favourable risk return profile for the group. while we will be capitalizing on volatility in the marketplace to capture opportunities for new investments on a highly selective basis, we will continue to manage our finances prudently to ensure a manageable level of debts and a high level of liquidity.
