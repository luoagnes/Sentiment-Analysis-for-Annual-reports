chairman s report to
the value of the trust s property assets now stand at hk$44.24 billion, an increase of hk$4.19 billion from a year ago distribution per unit for the year was hk$0.2617& underlying dpu growth was strong at 27.4% my fellow unitholders, on behalf of the board i am pleased to present champion reit s annual report for the financial year ended 31 december 2009.
2009 was operationally a challenging year, which saw the brunt of the impact from the banking and financial crisis coinciding with concerns of a full-blown h1n1 influenza epidemic. however, we experienced little in the way of contract defaults and thus the income momentum built up from 2008 continued to support revenue for champion reit into 2009. as a reflection of the strong recovery in transaction prices of commercial properties in 2009, the value of the trust s property assets now stand at hk$44.24 billion, an increase of hk$4.19 billion from a as a reflection of the increase in property prices in hong kong, and the accumulation of cash reserves, net asset value (nav) has increased from hk$5.37 to $5.67 per unit while gearing has improved from 36.0% to 32.2%. as part of a strategy to build up cash reserves in 2009, the trust introduced a distribution reinvestment arrangement which allows unitholders to opt for new units in lieu of their cash distribution. to date, hk$688 million in deployable cash reserves has been built up from this arrangement. in addition, a further hk$70 million has been retained by reducing the payout ratio from 100% to 94.6% this year.
these reserves will serve to increase financial flexibility and to facilitate growth through acquisitions in the future.
distribution per unit (dpu) for the year was hk$0.2617, comprising hk$0.1304 already paid out as an interim distribution, and hk$0.1313 to be paid out as the final distribution. the headline dpu figure was lower than in 2008, but only because of the reduction in payout ratio, and because of the additional cashflow from financial engineering and its unwinding in 2008. netting out the impact of these distortions, underlying dpu growth was strong at 27.4%.
while the champion reit s top line revenue numbers have held up well so far, a lagged impact from the 2009 rental downturn is inherent in the nature of multi-year leases and a decrease in income is expected for the year 2010.
however, we will continue to pursue a prudent strategy of generating stable and sustainable distributions for our lo ka shui
