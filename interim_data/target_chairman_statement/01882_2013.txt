chairman s statements
on behalf of haitian international holdings limited, ( haitian or the company ), with its subsidiaries (together, the group ), i am pleased to present the group s annual results for the year ended 31 december 2012.

the year 2012 was a challenging year for the machine manufacturing industry due to the unresolved sovereign debt crisis in europe, uncertainties surrounding the united states fiscal cliff and the moderating pace of the economic growth in the prc, have resulted in lackluster market environment. these, along with the state leader or the legislative elections in certain major global economies, added more uncertainties to the global economic outlook. the uncertainty in the global economy and the shrinking overseas demand have shakened the investment confidence of not only overseas customers but also export-driven domestic customers. at the same time, china also experienced a notable slowdown in growth as a result of monetary policy tightening measures implemented since the mid of 2011. with the challenging environment in the machine manufacturing industry and following an exceptional high demand of plastic injection moulding machines in 2010 and 1st half of 2011, most plastic injection moulding machine manufacturers recorded dramatic drops in revenue and some of our domestic industry peers were downsizing their scales or even suspended production. such adverse market conditions inevitably hampered our sales performance in 2012. with the full launch of our generation 2 plastic injection moulding machines, staying focused on our strategies to speed up product innovation cycles, and enhancing both the domestic and the export sales network, we alleviate the adverse impacts of the macro-environment to our business and reported a mild drop of revenue by 9.8% to rmb6,335.6 million for the year ended 31 december 2012 (the reported period ) compared to 2011, continuing to maintain the leading position in our industry.
during the reported period, we noted a pick-up in our sales from the trough of october 2011 but at a slow pace. in the second half of 2012, the market conditions were still tough but became more stable and we recorded a revenue of rmb3,156.6 million for the second half of 2012 which represented a negligible drop of 0.71% compared to the first half of 2012. under the sluggish market conditions, improving profitability and generating healthy operating cashflow have been important targets for our business. we are committed to our core strategy of technological evolution and would focus on developing new and resource-efficient machineries under the current difficult environment and not turning to low margin products with less profits at this stage. such commitment led our efforts in increasing the sales mix in new and innovative products with higher margin, raising our operational efficiency through introduction of lean manufacturing concepts, and decrease in steel related component costs, which let us achieve a good progress in improving the gross profit margin to 30.5% (1h 2012: 29.8%) and net profit margin to 15.9%(1h 2012: 15.3%) in the second half of 2012. we recorded a net profit of rmb500.4 million for the second half of 2012 which represented a mild increase of 3.0% compared to the first half of 2012. overall, our net profit of rmb986.0 million during the reported period only recorded a drop of 10.7% when compared to 2011 which was our group s record highest profit year. with committed efforts in working capital management and some observed relaxation of the tightening monetary measures in china, we reported an operating cash inflow excluding change of restricted cash of rmb1,232.6 million, representing an increase of 204.3% during the reported period when compared to the same period in 2011.

the board of directors has declared a final dividend of hk$0.15 per share for the year ended 31 december 2012, bringing the dividend for 2012 to hk$0.27 per share.
domestic and export sales the group s sales by geographic areas are summarized in the following table: (rmb million) 2012 % 2011 % domestic sales 4,189.7 66.1% 4,854.2 69.1% (13.7)% export sales 1,990.0 31.4% 1,992.6 28.4% (0.1)% parts (both domestic and export) 155.9 2.5% 180.8 2.5% (13.8)% total 6,335.6 100.0% 7,027.6 100.0% (9.8)% the persistent impact of the chinese tightening measures implemented since 2011 and slowdown of growth in the chinese economy as a result of both sluggish domestic consumption and external demand from export, all together adversely affected the confidence of our customers in china. this led to a slowdown in pimm demand in china and affected our domestic sales in 2012.
in the mid of 2012, we observed gradual relaxation of credit tightening policy in china including the reduction of reserve ratio and interest rate by pboc. these measures helped to stabilize the domestic economy and prevent it from further weakening. benefiting from a diversified customer portfolio, especially for large corporate customers which generally have strong financial position and carefully-planned capex schedule, our domestic sales was less impacted by the tightening measures than other industrial peers. our full-year domestic sales recorded a drop by 13.7% from rmb4,854.2 million in 2011 to rmb4,189.7 million in 2012.
the european sovereign debt crisis and the united states economy entering a softer growth phase together continued to pose challenges to the export markets. in view of our relatively low global market share in countries excluding china, we still have rooms to minimise the adverse impact of these challenges through committed strategies in expanding export sales including developing new markets, operating overseas service centers and assembly facilities and enhancing the pre-sale and after-sales services. our export sales remained stable during the reported period and recorded a negligible drop of 0.1% from rmb1,992.6 million in 2011 to rmb1,990.0 million in 2012. this minor drop was a result from appreciation of rmb against us dollars in 2012. the sales mix of export sales to our total revenue increased from 28.4% in 2011 to 31.4% in 2012.
small and medium-to-large tonnage sales the group s sales by small and medium-to-large tonnage pimms are summarized in the following table: (rmb million) 2012 % 2011 % small tonnage 3,747.0 59.1% 4,346.6 61.9% (13.8)% medium-to-large tonnage sales 2,432.7 38.4% 2,500.2 35.6% (2.7)% parts 155.9 2.5% 180.8 2.5% (13.8)% total 6,335.6 100.0% 7,027.6 100.0% (9.8)% the medium-to-large tonnage pimms are usually employed by medium-to-large-size enterprises which generally have stronger financial position and carefully planned capex. accordingly, the sales of medium-to-large machines is generally less sensitive to a sluggish market environment. our sales of medium-to-large tonnage pimms recorded a mild drop of 2.7% compared to the same period in 2011. in contrast, small tonnage pimms are generally more sensitive to macroeconomic changes. the growth in sales of all- electric pimms which are usually small tonnage pimm has partly compensated the drop of sales in small tonnage hydraulic pimms. as a result, the sales of small tonnage pimms recorded a drop of 13.8% compared to the same period in 2011.
during the reported period, the average selling price of our pimms increased from rmb253,000 in 2011 to rmb279,000. the increase of average selling price reflected the increase in the sales mix to medium-to-large tonnage pimms and the higher-value- added pimms. despite the tough operating environment, a number of our technological advanced products still performed well in 2012. sales of the venus series (all-electric pimms), jupiter series (two platen pimms) and ia series (multi-colour pimms) increased to rmb348.6 million, rmb273.8 million and rmb186.6 million, representing growth of 14.2%, 10.8% and 42.8% respectively when compared to 2011. their solid sales performance evidenced the importance of the product innovation, setting the platform for our future growth in technological advanced pimms.
innovation is one of the keys to our success. our strong capacity for product innovation continues to bring us greater differentiation and extends our leading position in the pimm market. in the second half of 2012, we start launching generation 2 of existing product lines including mars ii, venus ii and jupiter ii. generation 2 provides improvements in performance and ergonomics that are based to a large extend on continuous customer feedbacks. this means the generation 2 is even more customer oriented than all series before. with several patented new features in the generation 2 such as optimized injection, new mechanical clamping systems and new software for enhanced applications, the generation 2 offers higher precision, reliability, speed and price-performance ratio to our customers. the market response for the launch of generation 2 is encouraging and the sales mix of generation 2 in december 2012 accounted for 36% of our total sales in that month and is expected to further grow in 2013. we expect the launch of generation 2 can further enhance our competitiveness in product and cost position.

there are signs that the market slowdown had stabilized towards the end of 2012. with firmer labour market conditions, improving domestic demand and expectation in supportive government policy for different industries in china, we noted that the china s manufacturing pmi has been in expansionary territory with 50 above for four straight months starting from november 2012. after the election of the state leaders or legislative elections in certain major global economies including china, us and japan, the new leaders are expected to set out the future blue-prints for their countries developments and ease away policy uncertainties and boost the consumer and investment sentiment. following the conclusion of the national people s congress and chinese people s political consultation conference in march this year, the chinese government is likely to launch a series of economic stimulus policies to maintain the economic growth of china in the second half of 2013. therefore, we believe that the pimms market in china is likely to recover gradually albeit on a slow pace in 2013 and remain optimistic about the prospect of the industry in the long run. the demand of pimms (especially in large tonnage and all electric pimms) will continue to be driven by an on-going industrialisation, rising personal income levels, spurring plastics product output and consumption and increasing applications of plastic material in different areas. we will increase our future resources to develop new products to capture these growing opportunities in large tonnage and all electric pimms. by leveraging on our core strengths including our prestigious branding, unmatched product and service quality, r&d capabilities, efficient production scale and strong financial position, we believe we will continue to be one of a few winners under this headwind and hold a cautiously optimistic view of a satisfactory growth of our business for the year 2013.
we commit ourselves to achieving sustainable business growth in the long run. we will continue to prepare ourselves to capture business opportunities once market picks up with the following measures: " to speed up the product innovation cycle and develop machines by breaking down market demand into micro-segments with increased details and analysis so that more sophisticated pimm can be launched for different industries and customers.
" to raise operational efficiency by introduction of lean manufacturing concept to our group and raise the product quality and customer services by starting quality assurance campaign. through these measures, we can enhance our competitiveness in cost position, quality and services.
" to further enhance our three brand strategy, namely haitian, zhafir and tianjian, with dedicated r&d and sales teams to provide the technology to the point , at the price and technology level required to efficiently manufacture the respective plastics parts at our customers place.
" to enhance our sales mix with higher margin product and to address the increasing demand of technological advanced pimms, our small pimm will continue to move towards higher precision and all-electric driven and large pimm will move towards two- platen and compact design.
" to strengthen and enhance our sales network including the increase of the number of service centres for pre-sales and after- sales support, assigning dedicated teams to serve and follow up multi-national corporation key accounts and regularly meet up with customers and distributors to collect latest market development information so as to response to the market changes effectively and efficiently.
we believe that through the above-mentioned measures, haitian will be able to lay a solid foundation for growth in 2013 and bring satisfactory returns to our shareholders.

finally, on behalf of the board of directors, i would like to thanks all staff members for their contribution in the past year and at the same time, i would also like to express our gratitude towards our shareholders, customers, suppliers and business partners for their continued confidence in and support to our group.
