chairman s statement on behalf of the board, i would like to present the annual report of shangri-la asia limited for the financial year ended 31 december 2015.
both the global and the regional business environment continued to be challenging throughout the year. the operating performance of the group s hotel portfolio was impacted by weakening local currencies and the slow rate of supply absorption of new hotel rooms in consolidated revenues increased by 1% over 2015 to us$2,123 million. after tax profits (before non-operating items) attributable to shareholders decreased by 4% compared to 2014, to us$85.8 million. however, after tax profits (inclusive of non-operating items) attributable to shareholders decreased by 23% to us$140.1 million due to the impairment provision made in respect of hotels amounting to us$71.4 million (net of non-controlling interests) during the year.
a final dividend of hk 5 cents per ordinary share has been proposed, which when added to the interim dividend will amount to a total dividend of hk 10 cents per share for the financial year.
during the year, the group opened eight new hotels (two owned by third party interests) and an extension to an existing resort in malaysia, and signed management contracts for four new hotels being developed by third as in the previous financial year, the performance of our investment property portfolio continued to record a healthy improvement. this has made a positive contribution to the group s results for the year. with well-located premium properties and additions to this portfolio in the next few years, this trend is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.
i wish to thank all our staff and management for their commitment, hard work, and trust, and my fellow directors for their continued support and guidance.
