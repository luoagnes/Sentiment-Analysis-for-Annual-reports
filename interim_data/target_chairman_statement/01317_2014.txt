the company focuses on improving and combining chinese and western educational philosophies, as well as the realisation of its ideal quality education. our two transformation goals, namely repositioning ourselves as a cultivator of elite talent from focusing on international talent, and expansive transformation from schools to school districts and from school districts to education parks, are both being actively pursued. a dual-focus strategic plan is being implemented, improving our educational and teaching quality and optimizing our system linkages as we begin operating services related to students well-being such as uniform manufacturing, supermarkets, cultural shops and drinkable mineral water.
new school districts contracted for by the group and pending commencement include: yiwu maple leaf international school (high school, middle school, elementary school, preschool and foreign national school), which will open on september 1, 2015; xi an maple leaf international school (middle school and elementary school) and zhejiang pinghu maple leaf international school (middle school, elementary school and preschool), which will open on september 1, 2016; and xi an maple leaf international school (high school and foreign national school) which will open on september 1, 2017. based on our current plans for capacity expansion for each of the group s school as well as the ongoing negotiations for cooperative operation in various cities, we expect that 18-20 new schools will be opened by the group in the coming fi ve years, increasing the number of schools owned by the group to approximately 60 by the end of august 2020, with corresponding fast growth in student enrolment and revenue for the next fi ve years.

finally, on behalf of the board, i would like to express my appreciation for our students parents, the local governments for supporting our work, general society and, last but not least, our shareholders for their fi rm support for maple leaf education. we vow to contribute to society with our ever better educational services and performance shu liang sherman jen china maple leaf educational systems limited chairman and executive director dalian, prc, november 18, 2014
