chairman s statement in fy2016, the pace of economic recovery continued to slow down.
generally speaking, the economy of china operated steadily but was still challenged with downward pressure. the international oil prices remained at low levels with weak demand and severe competitions existed in oil and gas market. in fy2016, the domestic market demand for refined products was relatively stable and the supply continued to be excessive, with a loose supply and demand balance and a significant increase in the exportation of refined products.
while the domestic demand for natural gas kept increasing relatively fast in general despite a significant seasonal variance. the domestic output of natural gas increased steadily but in a slower pace than the import of natural gas.

facing the tangled and complicated situation of economic development in domestic and international market, the group seized opportunities in the low oil price environment, tight controlled over operating costs from upstream business, and adopted a twin-engine model which brings synergy effect of upstream and downstream businesses, ensuring the steady development of our overall business and generating a satisfactory return in fy2016.
the stable development of the group is attributable firstly to the smooth operation of the group s upstream production. the daily productions of the tuzi and the dina 1 gas fields have been stabilized at 3.05 million cubic meters in fy2016 and the daily production of the contract areas 0436 and 0536 in caofeidian remained at a steady level of 35,000 barrels after resumption of production on 20 august 2014. the group and its partners are currently finalizing a new odap for the new oil assets. it is expected that with the new odap offshore oil production, the group will commence a new phase of development.
facing severe pressure from the low global oil prices, the crude trading team continued to work with chinese oil majors to develop long-term supply contracts. the international trading and bunkering business of the group developed steadily, with sales volume increase of 26% over last year. from the perspective of marine bunkering, the group expanded its business to meet market demand in singapore by purchasing five bunker barges, among which three 7,000 dwt barges were awarded the certification of mass flow meter ( mfm ) by maritime and port authority of singapore ( mpa ). this achievement is widely recognized by world class ship owners as it would enhance bunkering efficiency and significantly reduced complaints and disputes arising from quantity differential.
