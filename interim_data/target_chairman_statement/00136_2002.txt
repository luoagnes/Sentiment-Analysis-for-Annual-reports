for the financial year under review, the group s core activity of sale of accessories of photographic products had experienced challenging time that was affected by the external factors of global slowdown in economy and the further depression in the us market after the event of 11 september terrorists attacks. price and production order competition became increasingly fiercer in the marketplace but the management was managed to maintain a relatively stable overall turnover for the year. due to the continual efforts undertaken by the management to introduce increasingly tighter cost control measures, the group was able to reduce the administration and distribution costs by more than 10% when compared with the last financial year.
business review (continued) with the further acquisition of 49% remaining equity interests in the largest sub-contractor during the year, the group had further consolidated the group s 100% self-owned production capacity and to further reduce the reliance on external independent sub-contractors. this had also contributed positively to reduce the overall costs and to offset the increasingly fiercer price competition in the industry.
