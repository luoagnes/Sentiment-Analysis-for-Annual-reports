our corporate vision is to become a world class corporation with excellence in our products, people and profits for the benefits of the host nation and all our shareholders. despite the uncertain global business outlook, we operate in an environment which is forecasted to register growth. cambodia is a basic agricultural economy with 14 million population of largely rural population. standard & poor s still affirmed (on 9 october 2008) a stable outlook for cambodia, praised the country s economic strategies, pragmatic market friendly directions, fiscal policy as credit strength and ability to maintain a real gdp growth of 7% (moef forecast of 5%) in 2009, despite today s financial storms spread.
nagacorp s conservative gaming policy may well suit in today uncertainty: no gearing, maximum table limit of us$50,000, catering for regional mid-size players and top competitive services continue to guide the strategic policies and directions of the company. cambodians reversed flow to home country as a result of political stability and unfavorable conditions in the west also help.
some of the strategies include catering for the macau disappeared gaming crowd. part of the 2009 strategy of enticing operators and gaming patrons from macau has recorded some interest from operators and players who would like to to increase marketing pressure on the indo-china catchment areas which include strategies attracting more home-coming cambodians, vgp (vietnam ground programme) are seen to be effective. nagaworld would also promote proactive programmes e.g. crp (complimentary rated programme) with regional airlines like airasia and shenzhen airlines by bringing in suitably qualified players from china, malaysia and thailand. with little capex expenses and almost fully completed nagaworld with low investments costs, nagaworld can offer competitive complementary hotel accommodation, food and beverage and entertainment facilities for regional players. the low tax rate also helps a lot to allow nagaworld to continue to devise strategic competitive junket vip programmes.
nagacorp has experience and sailed through difficult years before like the 1997 asian financial crisis and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) in 2003 and has laid down strategies in place accordingly.

nagaworld is a competitive product that offers attractive gaming and entertainment facilities.
nagacorp remains profitable in 2008.
however, in a very uncertain world market, with the rapid deterioration of the world situations and the unpredictable external factors, nagacorp is cautiously monitoring its business and hopefully in 2009 external factors will not badly affect the financial results in 2009.

in order to maintain the strategic position of the company and the monopoly and favourable tax status, nagaworld continues to devise private public sectors participation programmes.
naga world initiated many social community activities in 2008, noticeably the organization of the red cross charity dinner attended by the first lady of cambodia as the guest of honor, cabinet ministers, senior government servants, diplomats, financial community and members of the press from hong kong.
nagaworld will continue this journey of being a good corporate citizen and strive for excellence to uphold its position in the country, irrespective of the vicissitudes of the changing political economic social circumstances.

the company has engaged an independent professional party to review the internal controls of the company and its subsidiaries (collectively the group ) with a focus on anti-money laundering. the independent professional party has performed reviews of the internal controls of the group and its findings are set out in this report.
the company has also engaged another independent professional party to assess the investment risks in cambodia and its findings are set out in this report.

finally, we would like to express our gratitude to our shareholders, suppliers and customers for their unfaltering support. we would also like to thank our dedicated staff for their contributions to the success of the group.
