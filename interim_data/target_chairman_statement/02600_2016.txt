product market reviews primary aluminum market in 2015, the international and domestic price of primary aluminum was in a downward trend albeit with fluctuations and experienced a cliff-like drop in the fourth quarter. the price remained at a low level although it stablised following a dip at the end of the year.
in terms of international market, the international price of aluminum rapidly fell below usd1,800 per tonne due to the traditional slack season in the first quarter and even dropped to the level occurred in the middle of 2014 for a time. the later recovery of market demands and significant contango of international spot aluminum contributed to the increase in the international price of aluminum to usd1,977 per tonne at the beginning of may 2015, offsetting the drop in the earlier period. after that, the international price of aluminum fell again due to the increasing overcapacity and supply pressure and dipped to the lowest point for the first half year at usd1,671 per tonne in june 2015. ever since the third quarter of 2015, the increase in supply and demand pressure in the global aluminum market has pushed the international price of aluminum to continuously hit new lows of recent years and even approach the low point recorded upon the financial crisis in 2008 for a time. such fall last until the end of the year when the price of aluminum gradually stablised following the dip. in 2015, the average prices of spot aluminum and three-month aluminum futures at lme amounted to usd1,663 per tonne and usd1,682 per tonne, respectively, representing a decrease of 10.9% and 11.1% over 2014, respectively.
in terms of domestic market, due to the intensified imbalance between supply and demand in the aluminum market, the price of aluminum rapidly fell and hit a new low of recent years at rmb12,445 per tonne. with the gradual recovery of consumption after the spring festival as well as the production reduction of certain enterprises and increase in the lock percentage of domestic aluminum inventory, the supply pressure in the spot market tended to be mitigated, and the price of aluminum gradually picked up and even reached rmb13,620 per tonne for a time. in the second half of 2015, confronted with the increasing supply pressure, the price of aluminum continuously hit new lows and fell below rmb10,000 per tonne to the lowest of rmb9,550 per tonne in november 2015. the consequent massive production reduction of electrolytic aluminum enterprises was the important reason for the stabilising and picking-up of the price of aluminum in december 2015. in 2015, the average prices of spot aluminum and three-month aluminum futures at shfe amounted to rmb12,279 per tonne and rmb12,300 per tonne, respectively, representing a decrease of 9.7% and 10.2% over 2014, respectively.
according to the statistics, the global output and consumption of primary aluminum for 2015 were approximately 57.20 million tonnes and approximately 57.84 million tonnes, respectively. the domestic output and consumption of primary aluminum were approximately 31.00 million tonnes and approximately 30.64 million tonnes, respectively. as of the end of december 2015, the capacity utilization rate of primary aluminum enterprises in the world (inclusive of the prc) was 78.85%, while that of the prc was 79.61%.

in 2015, the domestic and international price of alumina went down further under the impact of the continuously low price of aluminum.
in terms of international market, despite of the strong performance in the first half of 2015 and the rebound in april 2015, the international price of alumina, dragged down by the price of alumina in the prc, experienced an accelerated plunge in june 2015 and dropped to usd201 per tonne at the end of december 2015, representing a decrease of 43.3% as compared with the usd354.5 per tonne at the end of 2014.
in terms of domestic market, the price of aluminum remained low. against the backdrop of general loss in the industry of electrolytic aluminum, a large number of domestic electrolytic aluminum enterprises implemented flexible production, resulting in a rapid drop in the demand for alumina and a sharp rise in supply pressure.
furthermore, most domestic electrolytic aluminum enterprises continuously reduced their inventory of alumina due to their poor financial position in recent years, thus imposing more pressure on the inventory of alumina enterprises and suppressing the price. in 2015, the price of domestic spot alumina fell unilaterally and the downward trend was fiercer after september 2015 as compared with that in the first half year. at the end of december 2015, the price dropped to rmb1,631 per tonne, the lowest price throughout the year, representing a decrease of rmb1,120 per tonne or 40.71% as compared with the rmb2,751 per tonne at the beginning of the year.
according to the statistics, the global output and consumption of alumina for 2015 were approximately 120.86 million tonnes and approximately 117.81 million tonnes, respectively. the domestic output and consumption of alumina were approximately 58.65 million tonnes and approximately 61.83 million tonnes, respectively. net imported alumina in the prc amounted to approximately 4.36 million tonnes in 2015. as of the end of december 2015, the alumina capacity utilization rate of alumina enterprises in the world (inclusive of the prc) was approximately 82.78%, while that of the prc was approximately 84.21%.
