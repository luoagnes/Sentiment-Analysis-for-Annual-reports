between the fourth quarter of 2002 and up to march 2003, the property market was strengthened by the new housing policies announced in november 2002. capitalising on the improved market sentiment during this period, the group launched two residential projects, namely, imperial villas phase i and phase ii in yuen long for sale in the first quarter of 2003. the projects are scheduled for completion in the financial year 2003 2004. market response was encouraging with over 99% of units sold within a short period of time.

the tensions in iraq depressed the global economic climate which in turn interrupted the growth at the beginning of 2003 and adversely affected the market sentiment. sales activities between march and may this year were low due to the outbreak of atypical pneumonia in hong kong which caused developers to postpone their projects. however, sales activities picked up by the end of the second quarter of 2003 when the epidemic was brought under control and the world health organisation removed hong kong from the list of affected areas. home purchasers are regaining confidence and as a result buying sentiment is gathering momentum.

units of imperial villas were well received during sales launch and virtually sold out.

the project was well received by the market and sales were encouraging.

in july 2003, the group also rolled out oceania heights in tuen mun while our joint venture partner marketed anglers bay in sham tseng. as both projects are located within the catchment area of the west rail, they received good response from the market and sales were again encouraging.

oceania heights in tuen mun received enthusiastic response from the market when it was launched.

rental activities for the group recorded a growth in the first half of the financial year 20022003. although the growth trend was hindered by atypical pneumonia which subsequently affected the businesses of our tenants and hotel revenue, the impact was partly mitigated by contingency plans and initiatives designed to manage and control unforeseen circumstances. our property management arm implemented a series of measures to stay resilient against the epidemic and concurrently, the group launched effective promotional activities in the shopping malls to boost both traffic flow and enhance customer loyalty, thereby creating more business opportunities for our tenants, enhancing the value of assets.

the gross rental revenue of the group, including the attributable share of its associates, has remained stable at hk$1,110 million compared to hk$1,106 million in the previous financial year with satisfactory overall occupancy. their highly diversified nature and favourable locations continue to prove to be significant contributing factors in ensuring stable recurrent the 1-month sino shop assistant campaign organised by sino land last november completed on a happy note. mr.

park avenue has been awarded the highly commended award at the 54th fiabci world congress this year. the award underscores the achievement of sino land in the pursuit of world-class real estate chairman s statement (continued) social and environmental responsibility
the group places great significance on corporate integrity, business ethics and good governance while acknowledging its corporate responsibilities to society.
we believe that interests of long-term shareholders can best be optimised by conducting our business in a socially responsible manner and by adopting, where possible, environmentally friendly practices in daily operations and business development. during the year, the group organised fund-raising activities for hong kong red cross and hong kong community chest.

our wholly-owned subsidiary, sino estates management limited, which focuses on asset and customer relation management, received several awards in recognition of its contributions to society and reinforcement of environmental protection for the benefit of its residential and commercial portfolios.

in september 2002, sino estates management limited won the 2002 estate for the chest award (yau tsim mong district) for considerable fund- raising activities on behalf of hong kong community chest and in december of the same year, a caring company award was bestowed on them by the hong kong council of on the environmental protection side, four residential projects under the company s management were awarded certificates of fresh water plumbing quality maintenance recognition scheme by the water supplies department in recognition of sterling work. in january 2003, regentville, one of the estates that it manages, was presented with a certificate of merit under the green office management in 2002 eco-business awards .

chairman s statement (continued) social and environmental responsibility (continued) in addition, both sing-ho security services limited and best result cleaning services limited received iso 9001: 2002 quality management system certification which affirms their standards of operational efficiency and quality service.

during the financial year, the group held various internal and external training programmes for over 4,680 employees which are designed, amongst other things, to strengthen their language proficiency, professional knowledge and management know-how as well as to enhance their productivity. course contents covered language skills; customer relations and customer service; information technology; self-enhancement initiatives and environmental conservation in respect of office administration, property management and project management. new courses will continually be developed to meet corporate and specific career planning needs.

just as the economic and social ties between the mainland and hong kong strengthens, and so the group continues its efforts in promoting the use of putonghua amongst staff by providing courses for various levels on a regular basis.
it is the group s policy that all staff, in particular front-line positions, must uphold meticulous customer service standards. in this regard, a consultancy has been engaged to provide an intensive training programme on quality customer service practices. over 2,000 staff undertook training during the financial year with positive and encouraging feedback from both participants and customers.

the group also manages an outstanding employee award scheme to recognise and reward outstanding performances by employees and identify and train potential leaders. during the period, 16 employees received awards.

sino estates management limited won the merit prize of 2002 hong kong eco business awards, for its outstanding achievement in chairman s statement (continued) the financial year 20022003 was indeed challenging made so by an unstable business environment. the property market was strengthened by the housing measures announced by the government in november 2002 which acted as important catalysts to build the foundation for a healthy and sustainable growth.
as a result, the buying sentiment picked up in the first quarter of 2003, but the positive impact was impeded by adverse external factors, the war in iraq and the unexpected outbreak of atypical pneumonia which severely affected not only property sales, but also in particular, tourism, hotels, food and beverage and retail businesses across hong kong and the region.

however, the negative effects have proved to be short-term with the war in iraq now over and atypical pneumonia under control. recovery is evident by the increase in inbound tourists rising from 0.43 million in may 2003 to 1.29 million in july 2003, favourable take-up in recent property sales and high shoppers flow in our shopping malls. the implementation of individual visit scheme will further boost tourists from the mainland which will benefit both the hotel and retail sectors in hong kong. the lifting of maximum limit of foreign currency that mainlanders can bring to hong kong will also boost the local consumption and retail sales.
the government s plan to introduce additional initiatives with a view to maintaining a sustainable and healthy growth in property market will further bolster people s confidence in the market. these are positive effects for not only the property market but also for the growth of the economy.

in the medium to long term, the continuing economic development of the pearl river delta region will increase trade and traffic flow and strengthen ties between the region and hong kong aiding in our city s economic recovery. the establishment of the closer economic partnership arrangement in june 2003 whereby zero import tariff preference is applied to a selected range of exports from hong kong will facilitate hong kong businesses in that it creates a higher level of access to the mainland market. this engenders economic activities between the territories resulting in mutual gain.

during the financial year, the group replenished its land bank with an additional 2.7 million square feet of attributable gross floor area at fair prices. this new addition will provide stable earning prospects in the years to come. the pre- sale of the projects in the past two years helps secure earnings in the coming financial years. approximately 75% of the residential units that are due for completion in the financial year 20032004 have been sold with attributable sale proceeds of over hk$3 billion. barring any unforeseen circumstances, the recent recovery trend in the market should have a positive impact on the earnings of the group for the financial year 20032004. the directors are confident of the prospects of the group in the medium to long term.

chairman s statement (continued) staff and management
on behalf of the board, i would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation to all staff for their commitment, dedication and continuing support.
i would also like to express my gratitude to my fellow directors for their guidance and wise counsel.
