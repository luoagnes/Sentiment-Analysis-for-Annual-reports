for the fiscal year of 20062007, a growth in containerboard sales was observed with 1.67 million tons of containerboard and 102,000 tons of pulp sold (another 100,000 tons of pulp was self-used); and the total sales volume was 1.77 million tons. the group achieved a turnover of hk$5,161 million and has recorded a net profit of hk$1,010 million.
this represents an increase in turnover of 36.6% and an increase in net profit of 68.3% over last year. during the year, all of our paper production lines and our pulp mill ran at maximum capacity.
during the year, we saw strong demand for containerboards driven by higher export and domestic demands of manufactured goods. further, our superior technology and our experienced management team allow us to produce excellent quality products at a lower cost. these two facts result in significantly higher turnover and higher margins.

the group is fully confident of the market. the group will install seven world-class paper production lines and two bleached hardwood kraft pulp (bhkp) production lines. in fact, pm8 and pm9, with a total annual capacity of 860,000 tons have already started production in the first half of 2007. pm10, pm11, with a total annual capacity of 600,000 tons, will commence production before september 2007. the remaining three paper production lines and two pulp production lines are also scheduled to start production within 2008. with this expansion, the groups annual pulp and paper capacity will reach 4,700,000 tons (500,000 tons of pulp and 4,200,000 tons of containerboard), making the group one of the largest pulp and paper producers in the world. just as important, we are extending our geographic coverage with two of our paper production lines (pm13 and pm15) and two pulp mills (bhkp1 and bhkp2) are scheduled to start at our new production sites in chongqing and vietnam in 2008 and will make contribution to the groups profit.
our challenges are beyond pure financial gains. with increasing social awareness in environmental protection, we are investing in the worlds most advanced technology to reduce water and energy consumption and to reduce the quantity of effluents produced. with these investments, we hope to lead the industry to a greener and healthier future, while becoming one of the largest and most important pulp and paper producers in the world.
