chairman s statement 2010 is the fi nal year of china s eleventh five-year plan . under the effective leadership of the central government, all objectives in its eleventh five-year plan were conclusively achieved as china achieved stable and relatively rapid economic development while also maintaining social stability and harmony. over the past year, with strong support from domestic and foreign regulatory authorities, all shareholders, customers and the efforts of the bank s management and staff, the bank continued to make further improvements in its reforms such that its various lines of business showed stable progress and it displayed relatively rapid business growth, developed management qualities and a harmonious working environment, thus making determined steps towards its stated strategic objectives.
review of current operating results and events over the past five
the operating results for 2010 have further highlighted the advantages of the scale and the growth the bank enjoys as a giant state-owned listed bank. as at the end of 2010, the group s total assets increased by 19.41% from the corresponding period in prior year to rmb3,950 billion and its market share of rmb-denominated loans and deposits increased by 0.18 and 0.07 percentage point respectively. net profi t for the year increased by 29.63% as compared to the corresponding period in prior year to rmb39.042 billion.
looking back, china achieved major social and economic developments over the course of its eleventh five-year plan (2006 2010) which was also the most glorious 5 years for the bank in its hundred years history.
in these fi ve years, the bank once again led the development of china s fi nancial sector. the bank continued to serve as a pioneer as it became the fi rst state-owned bank to complete the transformation of its share structure and to implement an a shares and a h shares rights issue, thus establishing a new and effective development path for the transformation of china s banking sector. as a pioneer in the area of integrated operations, the group has successfully transformed into a fi nancial holding group with a bank as the parent, thus pioneering a coordinated development model on the basis of effective risk segregation.
in these fi ve years, the bank formally crossed its fi rst hundred years milestone. in 2008, the bank became the fi rst national fi nancial institution to welcome its fi rst centennial. over the course of its hundred year history, the bank has accompanied china through the ups and downs of its social and economic development but this has only served to add to the bank s maturity and provided it with more confi dence regarding the future. as the bank steps into its next hundred years, it will continue to forge ahead steadily with the help of its clearly defi ned development strategy and direction as well as the dedication and unity of rank and fi le alike.
in these fi ve years, the bank consecutively achieved the best operating results in its history. due to good governance, the bank achieved exponential development despite the ups and downs of the environment.
its asset base increased by 1.8 times and net profi t increased by 3.1 times both of which have exceeded the average growth rate of china s banking sector. with its head held high, the bank entered the ranks of the world s top 500 enterprises, top 20 global commercial bank in terms of profi tability and top 30 in terms of market capitalisation. at the same time, the bank continued to improve the quality of its assets and its proportion of non-performing loans decreased from 2.37% as at the end of 2005 to 1.12% as at the end of in these fi ve years, the bank s corporate structure has undergone a complete transformation. the bank successfully returned to the a shares market and commandeered a leading position among its peers in terms of corporate governance and operation. its strategic management system was gradually improved as it formulated and implemented its development strategy of becoming a fi rst class listed universal banking group focusing on international expansion and specialising in wealth management . the bank achieved major breakthroughs in the transformation of various areas such as establishment of a customer-centric business philosophy, fi nalisation of its fi ne-grained management mechanism, optimisation of the organisational structure and operating process, product innovation, information technology, human resource management, brand and corporate culture development.
although the results of the bank s transformation and development has been encouraging, it must continue to remain focused. while the bank keeps an eye on its progress, it must not forget its past defi ciencies and continue to have in-depth knowledge of regulatory requirements, its strategic objectives and the distance between itself and its more advanced domestic and overseas counterparts. the bank still has a long journey ahead in the future and it must work doubly hard.
implementation of the strategy to become a first class listed universal banking group focusing on international expansion and specialising in wealth management while the bank s strategic objectives are long and far-sighted, it must implement its strategy tenaciously. as the saying goes, persevering is the act of going all the way, from having an idea in mind to making it a reality . i am pleased to see that the group s strategy of becoming a fi rst-class listed universal banking group focusing on international expansion and specialising in wealth management has become deeply rooted among the rank and fi le and with each individual employee making their own contributions towards the fulfi lment of the group s strategic objectives and mission.

on the integration front, the bank has reorganised its group structure with the banking entity as the parent and with subsidiaries in the fund, trust, leasing, insurance and investment banking business forming the rest of the fi nancial holding group. this diversifi cation resulted in a signifi cant strengthening of the group s fi nancial service capabilities. the bank continued to expand its integrated fi nancial services platform: bocommlife insurance, the fi rst domestic bank-owned insurance company received its offi cial licence from the regulators; the anji bocom rural bank has successfully commenced operations; and the shihezi bocom rural bank in xinjiang also received approval from the regulators. the group and its subsidiaries and associated companies achieved new breakthroughs as its subsidiaries achieve spectacular results. as at the end of 2010, total assets of the bank s subsidiaries were rmb42.963 billion and their contribution to the group s net profi t for the year was rmb834 million or 2.14%.
