we believe that the property market in macau will offer interesting and profitable opportunities for the group in the next few years.
substantial investment has already been committed by both the macau sar government and the private sector for the development of the gaming industry as well as for road, rail and social infrastructure. this investment is having a positive impact on both values and demand for residential properties in the city and we believe this will continue in the coming years.
to capitalize on this opportunity, the group acquired 71% of centro de conven - oes e exposies macau, limitada, a company which owns a parcel of land in cotai, macau. the macau sar government, however, has decided to re-zone the cotai area pursuant to their town planning requirement, and as a result has proposed an alternative residential plot of land for our consideration.
this proposal would accommodate a total gross floor area of up to a maximum of approximately 2.8 million square feet upon completion of development. the group has agreed to surrender the cotai land to the macau sar government upon finalization of details on the proposed land ii. logistics network 2004 has been a year of rapid growth and important developments for the group s logistics business.
in september, kerry logistics announced the acquisition of a 70% interest in eas international transportation ltd., a major logistics, warehousing, parcel express and freight forwarding operator in mainland china. the acquisition, completed on 13 january 2005, marks an important development in the continued expansion of kerry logistics pan-china logistics network. eas international transportation ltd. has changed its name to kerry eas logistics limited ( kerry eas logistics ). kerry eas logistics now serves its customers in over 1,100 cities from 120 offices covering all provinces of mainland china. the group is in the process of fully integrating kerry eas logistics network with the existing mainland china operations of kerry logistics, in order to leverage off the strengths of the respective businesses and to maximize the synergies of the two other acquisitions completed during the year include a 54.98% interest in siam seaport terminal & warehouses co., ltd. (now renamed as kerry siam seaport limited) in thailand which provides loading, unloading and other ancillary services to bulk carriers, as well as warehousing and transportation services in thailand.
this acquisition builds on the group s coverage of the south east asian market and is strategically placed to capitalize on growth in international and intra-asia trade in the region.
in mainland china, the group completed the construction of a 152,700 square feet bonded logistics centre in shanghai s waigaoqiao free trade zone, and acquired a site for a 173,300 square feet bonded logistics centre in tianjin s free trade zone, scheduled for completion in mid 2005. in addition, the group began the planning process for the development of a 269,000 square feet bonded logistics centre in futian free trade zone, shenzhen, which is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2006. these new bonded logistics centres will further strengthen kerry logistics operations in mainland china, by offering customers a network of modern facilities which complement and build on the existing freight forwarding and distribution businesses of kerry logistics and kerry eas logistics in during the year, the group transferred its investments in asia airfreight terminal ( aat ) and chiwan container terminal ( cct ) from the infrastructure division of the group to kerry logistics.
this restructuring exercise is intended to enable kerry logistics to take a more active role in the management of aat and cct and for the different operations to leverage off the synergies and the business opportunities arising from enhanced integration and the group entered into two new infrastructure investments in mainland china during 2004. the first investment is in a partnership with china guodian corporation, a major state-owned power plant operator in mainland china, for the development and operation of a coal-fired electricity power plant in yugan county, jiangxi province which is scheduled for completion at the end of 2007. the second investment is in the ownership, operation and maintenance of certain water treatment facilities in hohhot, inner mongolia through a partnership with chemquest sdn.
bhd. ( chemquest ), a company with extensive experience investing in and managing environmental the group has taken a minority interest in each of these infrastructure projects in line with the group s strategy to leverage off its knowledge of the china market to identify infrastructure opportunities, and to enter into joint ventures with strategic partners who possess technical expertise, experience and successful track records in the development and operation of specific projects.

2004 witnessed strong performance in the world economy, in which both the united states and mainland china played key pivotal roles.
mainland china s economy has shown impressive resilience in the face of increased commodity prices, such as crude oil, aluminium and steel, and has responded well to the central government s macro- economic policies to control fixed assets investments. despite facing an upward interest rate cycle in the region, we believe these increases will be measured and remain confident in the economic outlook for both hong kong and mainland china. we believe, therefore, that the prospects for the group will continue to improve in the during 2004, hong kong experienced a recovery in both economic conditions and market sentiment with gdp growth of around 8% for the year, compared with 3.2% for 2003, and hong kong s total export value had also increased by about 16% to hk$2,019 billion.
we believe that continued stability and growth in mainland china, combined with further integration of hong kong with the pearl river delta and aided by policies such as the closer economic partnership arrangement (cepa), will be key to sustaining hong kong s growth the hong kong property market has benefited during 2004 from a limited supply in certain sectors, particularly the high-end luxury residential sector, as well as more favourable inflation and interest rate environments. improved household and corporate balance sheets and continued growth in visitor arrivals from mainland china and other countries is expected to be sustainable. we believe, therefore, that the positive sentiment and momentum experienced in the hong kong property sector in 2004 will continue into 2005, which will underpin the performance and prospects of the group s property investment and development businesses in hong kong.
mainland china s gdp growth of 9.5% for 2004 (2003: 9.1%) continues to be fuelled by strong growth in mainland china s export trade, generating a trade surplus of us$32 billion at the end of 2004. in addition, foreign investment into mainland china also increased, showing growth of 13% during the year. these impressive growth levels are difficult to achieve without some inflationary pressure, however the consumer price index rose by approximately 2.7% reflecting the gradual but controlled rise in cost of living in mainland china.
we are of the view that mainland china is well-positioned to continue to grow, at a more modest rate in terms of gdp growth and capital investment without experiencing undue inflationary pressures. as a result, we expect to see the continuing development of an affluent consumer sector in mainland china as well as an increasing focus on infrastructure investments, especially in provincial and rural areas. in addition to the group s existing property development portfolio in metropolitan cities such as beijing, shanghai and shenzhen, the group will also continue to explore opportunities in prime locations in other provincial cities across mainland china as the country s economic growth starts to be felt in the group s logistics business has benefited from the growth in global and regional trade volumes in 2004 and will, we believe, continue to grow its turnover and margins as asia plays an even larger role in world trade. in addition, the acquisition and integration of kerry eas logistics into kerry logistics operations in mainland china will add significantly to the coverage and reach of the business, as well as offering many synergies and efficiencies to kerry logistics overall operations. in 2005, we will focus on the full integration of kerry logistics worldwide operations with kerry eas logistics operations in mainland china. with the strong market presence in mainland china under the kerry eas logistics banner and as a leader in the third party logistics services business in asia, kerry eas logistics is in the best position to service both niche and global customers whose demands for quality supply chain management services is expected to continue to grow significantly in the coming years. the expansion of kerry logistics worldwide network will result in a larger, broader customer base which will also enhance the quality and size of the earnings contribution generated by kerry logistics to the group as a whole.
on the infrastructure side, the group will continue to identify and evaluate other utilities and opportunities in mainland china, which are capable of generating attractive financial returns and a stable recurrent income base to the overall, going forward, the group will continue to develop and expand its core business operations of property investment and development and logistics network services, and will seek to develop its infrastructure business by investing in high quality projects which are capable of generating stable and recurrent income contribution to the group. the group will also continue to focus on maintaining a well-balanced portfolio of quality assets and earnings whilst having regard to careful risk management, project evaluation and risk control the group is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance and transparency to shareholders. the group adopts a prudent financial management policy, and has very sound accounting, financial reporting and internal control systems in place.
during 2004, the group has been awarded with the best listed company board award by the hong kong institute of directors.
details of the compliance measures undertaken by the group in the area of corporate governance during 2004 are discussed in more detail in the section headed corporate governance report of this annual report. in addition, staff members of the group are offered training courses in their respective fields which enrich their professional knowledge, technical expertise and management skills in the areas of regulatory compliance, project evaluation and execution.
these important attributes have altogether earned the continuing affirmation by standard & poor s of a bbb- credit rating for kerry properties limited, one of the best credit-rated listed companies in mrs lee pui ling, angelina resigned as an independent non-executive director with effect from 29 september 2004 due to her other business commitments. on behalf of the board, i would like to take the opportunity to thank mrs lee for her valuable efforts, advice and contributions during her tenure as an independent non-executive director of kerry properties limited.
