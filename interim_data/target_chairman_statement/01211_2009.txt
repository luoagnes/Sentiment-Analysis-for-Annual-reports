2008 was a year of extreme turbulence around the globe. the united stated sub-prime loan crisis triggered an unprecedented financial tsunami across the world. global economic growth experienced an instant decline, together with the impact from severe natural disasters and the post- olympics effect, the pace of economic growth in china was slackened. during the year under review, despite facing sudden changes in the operating environment, the overall business performance of the group remained satisfactory.
although the rechargeable battery business was affected by market conditions and recorded a slight decline, the handset component business and assembly services recorded significant growth, while the automobile business continued to achieve outstanding performance under the slow down of market growth. for the year of 2008, turnover of the group was approximately rmb26,788 million, representing a year- on-year increase of 26%. profit attributable to equity holders decreased by 37% to rmb1,021 million. the board of directors did not recommend paying any dividend for the year ended 31 december 2008.

nevertheless, the group remained firm in its global leading position, continued to capture major market shares and actively explored new business areas. the business of nickel batteries was affected by the economic downturn in the united states. the overall market for power tools was trimmed, creating pressure on sales volume. nonetheless, being the top global supplier of nickel batteries, byd maintained leading market shares and high gross profit margin amid the declining sales.
for handset components, facing the adverse market condition during the year, all handset manufacturers strived to boost sales and to capture market shares of other players by cutting price, creating pressure directly on the upstream manufacturers of handset components. nevertheless, for one-stop handset component suppliers who are equipped with high capability of vertical integration and ownership of global manufacturing and service platforms, such adversity of market condition gave rise to good opportunities to foster closer cooperation with international leading handset brands.

moreover, the long waited world s premiere epochal new energy dual mode (dm) electric car f3dm was officially launched on 15 december 2008 and further reinforced the position of the group as a technology-innovative domestic automobile enterprise. the launching of f3dm automobiles fully addressed the highly concerned global warming environmental issues of the world, new energy and environmental friendly electric automobiles will also be the global trend in future. during the year, midamerican energy holdings company, a subsidiary of berkshire hathaway entered into an agreement with the company, pursuant to which midamerican energy holdings company agreed to inject capital to the company. the subscription is subject to the approval of the relevant government or regulatory organisation. this would be favourable in driving global sales of the environmental friendly and energy saving automobiles of byd and its other environmental products, further enhancing the confidence of investors in byd.
