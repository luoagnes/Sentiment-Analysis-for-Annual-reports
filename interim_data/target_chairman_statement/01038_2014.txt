following its acquisition in the second half of 2013, avr, the energy-from-waste company in the netherlands, made an immediate contribution of hk$28 million for the period after completion.

in 2013, cki has achieved another record performance. this was bolstered by strong organic growth from our existing businesses as well as contributions from recent acquisitions, namely wales & west utilities, envirowaste and avr.
this provides the basis for future growth.

the group has a strong financial platform that will enable us to seek continued expansion opportunities. as at 31st december, 2013, cki had cash on hand of hk$5,958 million, while gearing remained low with a net debt to net total capital ratio of 8%. we have earned our reputation as one of the leading global infrastructure players and are privy to many of the major acquisition opportunities around the world. cki will continue to study and pursue attractive projects that will enhance shareholder value, while as always, we will not approach these new investment opportunities with a must-win mentality but will remain steadfast in adhering to our prudent investment criteria.
