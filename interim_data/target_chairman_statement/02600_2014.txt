product market reviews primary aluminum market in 2013, the world economy recovered slowly, which brought about a slight increase in the global consumption of primary aluminum. however, additional primary aluminum production capacity aggravated the problem of overcapacity in the world s aluminum market. meanwhile, it was expected that the global liquidity will tighten further, which will continue to suppress the price of aluminum.
in 2013, the price of primary aluminum continued its downward trend. in the beginning of 2013, the financial cliff problem in the u.s. was successfully solved. the economies of countries such as the prc and the u.s. had positive performance, which led the international and domestic aluminum prices to record high in the year. subsequent to march, the upturn of the world economy was below expectation.
the liability crunch around the world was expected to worsen. mounting pressure of oversupply in the aluminum market drove the price of primary aluminum to plunge continuously. in the third quarter, the major economies in the world witnessed upturn. along with the fact that the global demand-supply dynamics of primary aluminum was improved due to the reduction of production, the price of primary aluminum was rather stable. the price remained volatile in general. in the fourth quarter, the federal reserve in the u.s. announced that it would launch its qe exit plan. meanwhile, the demand and supply conflict in the global primary aluminum market worsened again, which suppressed the price of aluminum. as a result, the price of aluminum declined for a second time. in december, the international and domestic aluminum prices hit record low for the year. in 2013, the average price of three-month aluminum futures at shfe amounted to rmb14,592tone, representing a year-on-year decrease of 7.62%.
according to the statistics, the global output and consumption of primary aluminum for year 2013 were approximately 50.57 million tonnes and approximately 50.90 million tonnes, respectively; while the domestic output and consumption of primary aluminum were approximately 24.90 million tonnes and approximately 24.80 million tonnes, respectively. as of the end of december in 2013, the capacity utilization rate of primary aluminum enterprises in the world (inclusive of the prc) was 78.46%, while that of the prc was 79.81%.

in 2013, as there was limited new production of alumina abroad in recent years, the overall spot supply of aluminum overseas tended to be balanced and periodically stressed due to the rapid expansion of aluminum in the middle east and the rebound in the demand for imported alumina in the prc. although the alumina price at lme continued to decline, the fundamentals supported a slight rebound in the foreign spot price of alumina in 2013, with annual average price up to us$326 per tonne, representing a year-on-year increase of 2.19%.
in 2013, under the pressure of the continuous decline in the domestic aluminum price, the domestic price of alumina continued to fall as a whole until the end of september. in the fourth quarter, driven by increased demands for centralized production of primary aluminum enterprises in xinjiang region, the spot price of alumina slightly rebounded. however, such rebound was limited by the pressure of the a aluminum price. the annual average price of alumina at home was rmb2,497 per tonne, representing a year-on-year decrease of 5.70%.
according to the statistics, the global output and consumption of alumina for 2013 were approximately 106.80 million tonnes and approximately 105.13 million tonnes, respectively. the domestic output and consumption of alumina were approximately 49 million tonnes and approximately 51.30 million tonnes, respectively. imported alumina in the prc amounted to approximately 3.83 million tonnes in 2013. as of the end of december 2013, the alumina capacity utilization rate of alumina enterprises in the world (inclusive of the prc) was 79.48%, while that of the prc was 81.67%.

in 2013, the prc was on a stage of restructuring and transformation. under the pressure of overcapacity, the market prices of primary products of the company dropped continuously. facing severe market situations, the company adhered to the main course of strategy transformation, market-oriented reform and operation transitions, proactively responded to various difficulties and challenges, adopted a variety of practical and efficient approaches, so as to maintain smooth production and operation and to fulfill the working objectives of turning loss into gain set in the beginning of the year.
