business review and outlook vitamin c series the total output of this series for the year amounted to 28,655 tonnes, an increase of 56% over last year. following the significant expansion of the production capacity in the prc, price of vitamin c had been continuously under pressure. the average price of vitamin c decreased from us$3.61 per kg at the beginning of the year to us$2.94 per kg at the end of the year. the average price for the whole year was us$3.24 per kg, a decrease of 24% as compared with us$4.26 per kg in the previous year. the gross profit margin of the entire series decreased from 41.8% in the previous year to 25.6% in the current year.
in view of the existing production capacity in the prc, it is expected that the weak price will last some time. the group will continue to expand its customer base and strengthen the business relations with its existing customers.
we will also increase the proportion of our downstream products according to market demand in order to improve profitability of this series.

the total output of this series for the year amounted to 7,279 tonnes, an increase of 60% over last year. owing to the intense market competition and the excessive production capacity, prices remained low. the average prices of penicillin industrial salt and amoxicillin for the year were us$9.27 and us$21.26 per kg respectively. the gross profit margin of the entire series decreased from 15.9% in the previous year to 6.9% in the current year.
market consolidation still persists. however, the gradual increase in the utilization rate of the group s production lines in inner mongolia will help improve the performance of this series.

the total output of this series for the year amounted to 1,438 tonnes, an increase of 66% over last year. demand for 7-aca was strong in the current year and the price went up correspondingly. the average price of 7-aca for the year was us$92.82 per kg, an increase of 9% as compared with us$85.13 per kg in the previous year. the gross profit margin of the entire series increased from 17.8% in the previous year to 24.4% in the current year.
since the production capacity of 7-aca in the prc has increased significantly in the current year, excessive supply starts to develop. it is expected that product prices will be increasingly under pressure. at the beginning of 2006, the price of 7-aca has declined to approximately us$83 per kg.

despite of the fierce market competition, this business unit still recorded a growth rate of 17% in the current year.
