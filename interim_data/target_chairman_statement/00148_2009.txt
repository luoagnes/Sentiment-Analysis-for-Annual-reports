chairman s statement i am pleased to report that kingboard chemical holdings limited (the group ) concluded the financial year ended 31 december 2008 with resilient results despite adverse business environment in the second half of 2008. the group experienced a fall in both revenue and profitability in the fourth quarter of 2008 ( q4 2008 ) due to widespread market turbulence. bolstered by robust operational performance in the first half of 2008, we delivered a revenue growth of 18% to hk$23.7 billion while underlying net profit declined 20% to hk$2,103.6 million (excluding one-off non-cash exceptional items) for the full year. the strength of our three core businesses and proficient management team have enabled the group to respond promptly to rapid market changes with decisive action in spite of this extremely tough operating underscoring the synergies created by our franchise, laminate and pcb divisions continued to be profitable and made positive contribution to earnings of the group notwithstanding significant demand drop from customers in q4 2008. during the year, we acquired a taiwanese pcb shop in suzhou which added about 5% to overall pcb production capacity. our strategic investments in chemical projects in the last few years continued to bear fruit.
after accounting for the share of profits from our hainan methanol joint venture, our chemical business delivered an impressive 19% year-on-year earnings growth and contributed about 36% of total group earnings before interests and tax ( ebit ) in 2008.
this clearly demonstrates that our persistent focus on building a balanced business portfolio with diversified income stream has created a concrete foothold against economic downturn.

the electronics industry was impacted badly in q4 2008 by the snowball effect of the global credit crunch which affected all business sectors. in anticipation of shrinking demand, manufacturers in the electronic supply chain reacted by scaling down production and slashing inventories aggressively towards the year end. as a result, revenue (including inter-segment sales) for the laminate division declined 6% to hk$9,638.2 million.
lower average selling prices coupled with reduced shipments in q4 2008 posed pressure on our margin. ebit was down 35% to hk$1,391.0 million over the previous year. volume sales reduced by 6% with the average monthly shipment reaching 7.8 million sq. meters. however, the resilient performance of the laminate division clearly indicated that we have outperformed our peers during this down cycle.
similar to the laminate division, pcb order bookings saw a decline in q4 2008. cushioned by strong performance in the first three quarters of 2008 and positive contribution from the newly acquired pcb shop in suzhou, revenue for pcb division was up 4% to hk$7,869.8 million with ebit improved by 1% to hk$586.9 million from the previous financial year. both new high density interconnect ( hdi ) pcb plants in kunshan, jiangsu province and kaiping, guangdong province commenced production successfully in december 2008. the group expects sales of hdi to show significant growth in the current year.
driven by new production capacity mainly from the natural gas based methanol plant in chongqing, phenolacetone plant in huizhou and cokemethanol plant in hebei, chemical division recorded remarkable year-on-year revenue growth of 74% to hk$9,464.3 million with ebit increased 16% to hk$763.8 million in 2008 despite fall in demand and selling prices in q4 2008.
apart from the above, share of associates results was up 25% to hk$369.8 million with bulk of which coming from our natural gas based methanol joint venture with china blue chemical limited.
liquidity and capital resources our financial and liquidity position continued to be strong. as at 31 december 2008, net current assets and current ratio of the group were approximately hk$5,264.4 million (31 december 2007 hk$6,377.6 million) and 1.72 (31 december 2007 1.89) the net working capital cycle shortened from 84 days as at 31 december 2007 to 65 days as at 31 december 2008 on the following key metrics: inventories, in terms of stock turnover days, reduced substantially to 48 days (31 december 2007 64 days) as a result of reduction in raw material purchase in q4 2008.
trade receivables, in terms of debtors turnover days, decreased significantly to 61 days (31 december 2007 90 days) as a result of decrease in sales revenue in q4 trade and bills payables, in terms of creditors turnover days, decreased to 44 days (31 december 2007 70 days), in line with reduction in purchase volume.
in 2008, the group invested hk$3.8 billion in new production capacity and made deposits of hk$1.4 billion for properties, plant and equipment. the group s net gearing ratio (ratio of interest bearing borrowings net of cash and cash equivalents to total equity) was approximately 23% (31 december 2007: 17%).
the proportion of bank borrowings between short term and long term stood at 27%: 73% (31 december 2007: 24%: 76%).
as at 31 december 2008, cash on hand and other committed and undrawn bank loan facilities were about hk$4.2 billion and hk$2.5 billion respectively. hence, the group is in a strong financial position to capitalize on any opportunities arising from the current downturn. only 2% of the bank borrowings was denominated in renminbi and the rest in hong kong or us the group continued to adopt a prudent financial management policy including the use of interest rate swap contract to minimize exposure to fluctuation in interest rates movement. at the end of 2008, we had entered into interest rate swap agreements of notional amount of hk$5.5 billion with reputable financial institutions for a weighed average duration and interest rate of 1.73 years and 3.02% respectively. we also entered into commodity and foreign currency forward contracts to manage the group s exposure to fluctuation in exchange rates and commodity prices.
the fair value of these contracts amounted to hk$2.9 million as at 31 december 2008. other than derivative financial instruments in connection with our daily operations as mentioned above and the convertible bond in connection with g-prop (holdings) limited which was disposed during the year, the group had not entered into any other type of derivative financial instruments throughout 2008. there was no material foreign exchange exposure to the group during the year under review. the group s revenue, mostly denominated in hong kong dollars, renminbi and us dollars, was fairly matched with the currency requirement of operating expenses.

as at 31 december 2008, the group had a global workforce of over 40,800 (31 december 2007: 47,200). the decrease in headcount was in line with lower manufacturing output in q4 2008. in addition to offering competitive salary package, the group grants share options and discretionary bonuses to eligible employees based on our overall financial achievement and their whilst the global economy faces significant challenges in 2009, our business outlook remains positive in the long term.
as a major manufacturer for a wide range of key materials in china, we shall benefit from the enormous growth potential of this emerging market due to china s continuous urbanization and industrialization. a series of economic stimulus measures introduced by the chinese government, in particular, subsidies for electronic products purchase in the rural area is likely to have a positive effect on the growth prospects for the group. coupled with our robust balance sheet, we believe that the group will surmount current challenges and emerge from this downturn as an even stronger player.
the laminate division experienced an uptrend in demand in february 2009. as a result, all of our laminate plants operated at higher utilization rates in february 2009 as compared to january 2009. in addition, raw material costs reduction in q1 2009 is expected to ease margin pressure as compared to that experienced in q4 2008. the group will allocate more resources to expand our customer base. we believe that the current operating environment is a good opportunity to increase market share as weaker competitors may exit the market.
pcb division also experienced improved capacity utilization and better inflow of orders after the chinese lunar new year. order bookings from the communication sector have shown the best performance as a result of investments in 3g infrastructure in china. hdi orders, most of which relate to mobile handsets, also saw strong growth. moreover, with our successful acquisition of a pcb shop in suzhou last year, the group acquired 51% interests in its sister pcb shop in dongguan, guangdong province in march 2009. this immediately increases pcb production capacity by about 5% and further reinforces our leading position as the largest pcb manufacturer in china. to capture the opportunities arising from the downturn, the group is actively in discussions with a few pcb manufacturers on the prospects of possible co-operation.
our commodity and specialty chemical plants are seeing the benefits from the economic stimulus initiatives in china as coke price has shown an uptrend and methanol price has stabilized since end of last year. construction of the new acetic acid plant adjacent to the existing cokemethanol plant in hebei province remains on track for trial production by the end of 2009. using methanol and coke granules as feedstock, this acetic acid project with a monthly capacity of about 42,000 metric tonnes will further enhance our vertically integrated business model and is expected to bring in attractive returns.

finally, on behalf of the board, i would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to our shareholders, customers, banks, the management and employees for their unreserved support to the group in the past year.
