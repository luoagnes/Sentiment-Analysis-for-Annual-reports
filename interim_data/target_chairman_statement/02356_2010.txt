chairman s statement during 2009, economic conditions broadly improved, with hong kong benefitting from stronger economic growth and lower unemployment, as well as positive economic conditions in the mainland continuing, in part due to the stimulus measures promoted by the central government. macau also followed a similar trend.
globally, following the substantial monetary and fiscal stimulus measures implemented by many leading countries in late 2008 in response to the global financial crisis, and improved conditions in the banking industry following large scale recapitalisation, there were signs of economic stabilisation, and also evidence of a broad- based recovery in the second half of 2009. the global economy and financial market appear to have passed the worst point of the cycle.

the hang seng index closed at above 21,800 points and dah sing financial holdings and dah sing banking group share prices recorded a stronger performance at the 2009 year end.

in line with the stabilising and slightly more favourable economic conditions, our performance improved substantially over 2008, with profit attributable to shareholders rising from hk$189 million in 2008 to hk$601 million in the year, an increase of 219%. our capital position also strengthened notably, both due to the stronger operating performance, as well as due to a number of capital raising initiatives during the year included the conversion of our shareholders loan of hk$1 billion as equity, with tier 1 capital adequacy and total capital adequacy of our group increasing from 6.8% and 13.6% as at 31 december 2008 to 10.2% and 16.8% respectively as at 31 december 2009.

whilst net interest income was slightly lower than 2008, fee income was weak, principally due to reduced activity in the wealth management business. with the gradual improvement in the economy, credit costs began to turn around, with impairment charges dropping substantially for the year. we also did not experience any exceptional or large losses on securities investments during the year.
core lending performance was steady, with a slightly lower loan book. our deposit position continued to be very healthy, with the increase in customer deposits during the year more than outweighing the reduction in wholesale funding.
we took part in an industry wide settlement scheme with lehman minibond investors during the course of the year, and have placed great emphasis and effort to improve and upgrade our investment product sales in line with the new guidance from regulators, as well as market practice and expectations.
our 20% associate, bank of chongqing, achieved a set of very strong results in the year, contributing hk$196 million to our profit, representing 62% growth when compared with 2008.
dah sing bank s wholly owned and locally incorporated subsidiary bank in china, dah sing bank (china) limited, continued its gradual expansion, with the opening of new branches in nanchang and zhenjiang, in addition to the existing operations in shenzhen and shanghai. with china s strong growth and huge development opportunities, we look forward to the continued growth of this subsidiary, and our business expansion, in china.

senior management of the group recently met with mr. liu mingkang, chairman of china banking (left to right) mr. derek wong, managing director and chief executive, mr. david s.y. wong, chairman, mr. liu mingkang, mr. harold wong, director.

board of directors during the year, mr. kazutake kobayashi, succeeding mr. keisuke tahara, was appointed as a non-executive director to represent the interest of the bank of tokyo-mitsubishi ufj, ltd. in the company.
i would like to welcome mr. kobayashi joining the board and express my gratitude to the resigned mr. tahara for his valuable contribution during his tenure in the board.

mr. david s.y. wong (right), the chairman of dah sing group, presented a souvenir photo to mr. chung-kai chow (left) upon his retirement with effect from 1 june 2009, after his 22 years of directorship in the group.

on 1 june 2009, mr. chung-kai chow retired as the vice chairman and a non-executive director of dah sing financial holdings limited, the holding company of the group, after 22 years of directorship in the group. i would like to express my tremendous gratitude to mr. chow on his retirement for his invaluable contribution to the whole group.

2008 and 2009 were two of the most difficult years for the global financial industry in recent history. whilst asia was less badly affected than europe or the us, the past two years had also been very challenging. we are optimistic that the improvement in our results in 2009 under the healthier economic backdrop, as well as the steps we have taken to strengthen our capital position, mean that we are now through the worst of the storm.

therefore, our strategy for 2010 will be one of cautious optimism.
we believe that the prospects for the greater china and asian region are still promising, and that over the medium to long term will present many opportunities. however, in the short term we are still mindful that the crisis is not fully over, and that we will still need to operate with caution.
with the turbulent decade ended in 2009 now behind us, we look forward to the continued growth and prosperity of our group during this new decade, and above all, we believe that our group s future prospects are encouraging.
finally, i would like to thank my fellow directors for their valuable contribution and extend on behalf of the board, our appreciation to all our colleagues for their hard work and dedication over the past year, and also our appreciation of the support of our customers and david shou-yeh wong
