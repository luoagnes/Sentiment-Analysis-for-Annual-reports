in 2014, the gradual soft landing of the prc real estate sector may become a reality and it is expected that the growth of transaction volume and selling price will be tighten. the tendency of the large ones get larger, the strong ones get stronger will become increasingly obvious. the outlook of the market is rationality and prosperity .
however, as the american economy recovered gradually and the scale of quantitative easing has been reduced, the era of the cheap us dollar will end, just as china s market-oriented interest rate reform begins. as the american and european economies begin to recover, chinese exports will continue to grow. the proposals put forward by the central economic working conference, such as new urbanization and institutional innovation, will be the new engine of chinese economic development. together with the internal demand of upgraded consumption, this will also drive the real estate industry to develop further.
also, the 10 years of continuous macro market control measurement will further introduce market-oriented, long term mechanism to create a comparative stable environment. for those companies which are resource dominant and management innovative will benefit from the next phrase of development.

for the scale of land reserves, the group still insists on adopting the principle of the replenishment is equal to the consumption .
we aim to achieve slight growth amid stability on the scale of land reserves. while project volume in the first to third-tier cities will be more balanced, the scale will be more coordinated.
the group has a settled land premium of rmb136.90 billion for its existing land reserves and rmb57.15 billion remains outstanding, of which a land premium of rmb15.70 billion is expected to be settled in the first half of 2014, land premium of rmb12.80 billion is expected to be settled in the second half of 2014, land premium of rmb17.15 billion is expected to be settled in 2015 and land premium of rmb11.50 billion is expected to be settled in 2016 or beyond.

in 2014, although it is widely expected that the growth of transaction volumes and prices in the market may narrow and local regions may experience short-term market fluctuations, the policy and market environment generally remains stable, which provides a solid base for the group to operate within and achieve superior sales performance. the group will follow market trends, ensure sufficient inventory, formulate its regional sales plan in line with key focus areas, sales targets broken down for each project, and maintain robust such as annual marketing activity throughout the year, to ensure that our full-year sales targets as executed.
the contracted sales target of the group in 2014 is rmb110 billion, representing a growth of 10.0% over that of 2013 whereby there will be over 50 new residential projects available for sale. these premises are situated in city centres and surrounding areas such as beijing, shanghai, guangzhou, shenzhen, tianjin, chongqing, jinan, nanjing, hefei, hangzhou and ningbo. the group proposes to capitalize on market timing and selectively develop new projects for sale in accordance with overall market needs. apart from this, there will be several residential and commercial complex projects and a number of stores and parking spaces for sales in the residential projects, which are likely to supplement the contracted sales of the entire year.
with regard to the pricing strategy, the group will strike a balance between the selling price and sales volume, elevate sales performance as well as maintain a reasonable selling price and relatively stable and balanced monthly sales performance in a flexible and practical manner. given our remarkable sales performance before, together with our execution ability and product strength of the group, the board is full of confidence that we can achieve our full-year contracted sales target.

the group will continue to maintain robust financial policies and endeavor to raise the total amount of cash and net profit margin for its main operations. to accomplish this, the group will further enhance the collection of sales proceeds, increase the turnover of inventory assets, sell part of the commercial premises and continue to expand project cooperation.
