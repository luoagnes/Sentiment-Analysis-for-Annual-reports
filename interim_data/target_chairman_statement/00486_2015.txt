against the current backdrop, uc rusal s strategy to focus on economically and environmentally efficient production is paying off. the management team has continued to pursue a stringent cost management strategy and with the support of external market factors successfully reduced aluminium cash cost to usd1,671t in the fourth quarter of 2014. adjusted ebitda margin improved to 26.1% in the fourth quarter of 2014, while the adjusted ebitda margin for the year was 16.2% against just 6.7% in 2013.
despite uc rusal s steadfast adherence to ongoing strategic production discipline, which resulted in output decreasing by 7% compared to 2013, rusal remained the world s largest aluminium company by production.

we are conscious at climate change and are continuously looking to decrease co2 emissions. in 2014, we reached a goal set in 1990 to decrease emissions by 50% by the beginning of 2015.
no less important are the company s ongoing modernisation and innovation projects. we continue to invest in the modernisation and upgrade of our existing capacities, as well as building efficient upstream vertical integration and increasing the value-added product mix. a new casting line with 120kt of large diameter billets (460mm) capacity is under construction at the krasnoyarsk aluminium smelter. in addition, wire rod capacity (kaz) of 50kt and slab capacity of 105kt (saz) were added to the company s portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2014.
