chairman s statement for the year ended 31 december 2010, the net loss attributable to owners of the company and its subsidiaries (collectively the group ) was hk$381,573,000. the overall performance was not satisfactory. there are two factors leading to the above: firstly, austerity measures in china have a great impact on the property market which is the core business of the group. as a result, the project development progress was delayed and hence failed to meet the sales expectation. secondly, the it business division of the company s listed subsidiary, sino-i technology limited ( sino-i ), remained in a loss-suffering position because sino-i kept on following its strategies of continued investment in technologies and r&d, and such investment has not yet generated its returns from the market.
however, from another perspective, the china property market still has good business potentiality. as for the it business, especially e-commerce market, is undergoing a structural change and gradually moving to maturity, therefore, both property development business and it business of the group have good meanwhile, in recent years, the relevant business in the film industry continuously invested and promoted by dadi media (hk) limited ( dadi ) a subsidiary of the company, is gradually being established and is on the track for rapid development, which will be the third largest core business of the group besides property development and it business.

the overall alteration progress has been affected due to a change of the planning of educational facilities.
the development of phase 3 originally scheduled to be launched in april 2010 has to be postponed to 2011.
however, as higher revenue is expected to be brought by such alteration, the group is willing to invest more time.

in the corporate it application services division, sino-i strongly believes that e-commerce is the key to achieving informatization for enterprises, having unlimited room for development. it has been committed to making continuous large investment in r&d of the related products and technologies. recently, e-commerce market in china has emerged new and prominent changes which indicate that e-commerce has been in a stage of substantial application in 2010, two main subsidiaries of sino-i, -norryb n gplqs (ce dongli technology company limited) ( ce dongli ) and sne}xexoobs gplqs (beijing xinnet cyber information company limited) ( xinnet ), whose relevant businesses have achieved a greater growth. resulting from an improved product mix, both revenue and gross profit margin have improved significantly. meanwhile, sino-i has continuously made heavy investments in technology r&d, which in turn has achieved significant progress in key technology areas such as cloud computing and virtualization. further improvements have also been made through user experience and integrated application, which in turn would enhance the competitiveness of the products and services.
due to the heavy cost in technology r&d, the corporate it application services business will inevitably remain in a temporarily loss-suffering position before having its profit.
in addition, snn woo gplqs (beijing shihua international financial information company limited) ( shihua ), which engages in financial information services business, a subsidiary of sino-i, was loss-suffering throughout 2010. the increase in the number of training programmes in accounting and rapid growth of the number of members for sny'y0w zye}a} gr gplqs (beijing chinese dadi distance education company limited) ( chinese dadi ), which engages in distance learning education services, have realized a turnaround.
