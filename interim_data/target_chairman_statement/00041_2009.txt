chairman s statement having come into 2009 with a healthy capital structure, the group s financial strength will position it to withstand the fallout of the ongoing we will continue to build the langham hotel brand, but we will be very disciplined in our approach of only investing in projects that meet our high thresholds on quality and the group s interests in investment properties in hong kong, through its 49% holding in champion reit have continued to generate significant income to the group in 2008. the group has received total distributions of hk$464 million from the reit during the calendar year 2008 (2007: hk$85 million).
after enjoying many quarters of robust economic growth, the spread of a synchronized global downturn has started to impact the hong kong economy in the latter part of 2008. correspondingly, the group s hotel business has witnessed a pull back in demand and revenues have declined. in fact the overseas hotels had started feeling the adverse impact earlier in 2008.
core profit attributable to shareholders increased 28.3% year-on-year to hk$1,150 million for 2008.
the growth was driven primarily by rising income from champion reit and lower financial expense.
asset enhancement and growing footprint at our hotel portfolio in 2008, major renovations were being carried out to enhance the group s assets, including that at the group s flagship hotel, the langham london. these capital improvement works undertaken represent important milestones toward growing and creating long term value for the group s shareholders. in particular, the renovation at langham london was an important one that would help to anchor the langham brand. it was successfully carried out in phases, which helped to avoid a discontinuity of guest arrivals, and at the same time, minimize disruption to the hotel s meanwhile, some new hotels in the pipeline, which are all under pure hotel management contracts with no equity stake, are set to soft open from the summer of 2009. however, several hotel developers that we have contracted for management have stopped or delayed their projects due to the financial crisis. all in all, the upgraded hotels and an expansion in global footprint will further strengthen the group s hotel revenue from hotel division, excluding revenue contribution from the newly acquired pasadena hotel, dropped by 6.7% year-on-year to hk$2,733 million in ebitda from the hotel division dropped by 26% year- on-year to hk$657 million in 2008, mainly due to rebranding cost at langham pasadena and generally weaker performance across all locations.
significant increase in income from the champion reit contribution from the champion reit increased substantially by 284% year-on-year to hk$812 million in 2008, the growth came primarily on the back of higher distribution income from higher rental income at citibank plaza, along with higher asset manager fee. agency income increased the least, but still up 79% year-on-year in 2008.
with the additional rental income contribution from the two newly added properties from june 2008, income from the champion reit should continue to increase in 2009. on top of that, the more resilient income nature of the newly added properties should help to diversify and stabilize future income stream from the champion reit.
investment property portfolio an upward trend in rental rates at the group s rental income portfolio throughout 2008 helped to boost rental income across our investment properties in hong kong. despite increasing pressure on rental and occupancy rates from the fourth quarter of last year, this was not enough to offset the growth achieved from the first three quarters of the year.
bearing in mind that the langham place mall and office tower, which contributed 61% of the gross rental income in 2007, were spun off in june 2008.
as a result, gross rental income for the group actually fell by 33% year-on-year in 2008. going forward, the performance of the langham place office tower and retail mall will be reflected from the distribution received from our 49%-owned champion reit.
strong financial position as at the end of 2008, cash at hand amounted to hk$3,393 million, partially due to the successful asset injection of our two properties into the champion reit in june 2008.
net debt increased in the second half of 2008, to stand at hk$1,033 million as at the end of 2008, compared to a net cash position as at june 2008, largely driven by the special dividends paid out. net gearing stood at 6% as at the end of 2008.
our strong cash position, coupled with limited capital expenditure commitment, should shelter us from the fallout of the global crisis.

with the additional revenue contribution from the langham pasadena, which was acquired on 8 january 2008, revenue from the hotel business increased 5% year-on-year to hk$3,063 million for 2008. revenue however would have dropped by 6.7% year-on-year to hk$2,733 million, if we exclude contribution from the newly acquired hotel.

for the year 2008, the hotel achieved an average occupancy of 68% (2007: 72%) and average room rate of 243 (2007: 188). these operating statistics are based on the number of rooms available for sale given such a significant uplift to the overall building, even though the global economy is expected to remain weak in 2009, the launch of the renovated rooms should still be able to command a premium over the historic room rates achieved. the hotel is set to soft open from the second quarter of 2009 and a full launch is targeted in mid-2009. in 2009, we expect the langham london to resume profit contribution to the langham, boston the global financial and economic crisis severely affected this financial district hotel s business results, revenue from the hotel dropped by 15% year-on- year to us$ 28.9 million. slower corporate activity was evident with cutbacks in travel expenditure and reduced citywide events, which hampered business results. the opening of the spa in june 2008, however, gave the hotel a better quality product to enhance the for the year 2008, the hotel achieved an average occupancy of 65% (2007: 74%) and average room rate of us$250 (2007: us$249).

on 12 march 2009, the champion reit reported its 2008 full year results, and declared a final distribution of hk14.1 cents per unit for the second half of 2008.
due to the group s accounting policy of recognizing distribution income from the champion reit at the date of payment of the distribution, the income statement of the group for a six-month period would reflect the distribution declared by the champion reit for the immediately preceding six-month period.
therefore the distribution declared by the champion reit for the second half of 2008 will instead be booked in the group s first half results for 2009.
in 2008, distribution from the champion reit increased by 450% year-on-year to hk$464 million, the increase was largely driven by positive rental reversion at citibank plaza. manager s fee, which included a one-time acquisition fee for the new properties, increased 211% year-on-year to hk$285 million.

during 2008, both spot rentals (the rental rate applicable to new leases) and passing rentals (the average rental rate of existing tenancies) at citibank plaza continued to see an improvement. spot rental rates achieved at citibank plaza were around hk$120 per sq. ft in the fourth quarter of 2008, 20% higher than that at beginning of the year. occupancy in citibank plaza at year end 2008 remained at a high level of 97.9%. during the year, the rent rates of about a third of the leases in citibank plaza by floor area were marked to market at higher levels through the renewal or re-letting of expired tenancies and rent reviews on existing tenancies. as a result, the passing rent rates saw a significant increase from hk$67.06 per sq. ft. at the beginning of the year to hk$87.46 per sq. ft. in december 2008.
langham place office tower langham place s reputation as a proven quality development and its superior subway location have allowed the office tower to compete effectively for tenants, and the year-end occupancy rate was 98.3%.
the spot rents for office space at langham place were maintained at between hk$32 to hk$40 per. sq. ft. in the second half of 2008 with increased support from location-sensitive lifestyle sector tenants.
langham place mall 2008 was a year which saw langham place mall firmly entrenching itself as one of the most popular shopping centres in kowloon. the mall remained almost fully let throughout the period and the year-end occupancy rate was 97.7% while the number of visitors jumped by 28% year-on-year in 2008. compared to the same period last year, there was a 12% rise in the average monthly gross sales per square foot at the mall for the last six months of 2008. 16% of leases by floor area was rolled over during this period, and the passing rent rate of the mall has increased to hk$88.90 per lettable sq. ft. as of december 2008.

great eagle centre despite signs of weakening towards the end of 2008, gross rental income grew by 11.8% year-on-year from hk$82.2 million to hk$91.8 million in 2008. positive rental reversion was the key driver for the increase, as achieved rental rates continued to surpass those of the expiring leases. correspondingly, net rental income rose by 14.8% year-on-year from hk$77.4 million to as at the end of 2008, occupancy rate at great eagle centre stood at 93.6%, which was lowered from the 99.3% as at the end of 2007, but improved from the 91.9% as at mid 2008.
eaton house furnished apartments gross rental income increased 4.7% year-on-year to hk$42.1 million in 2008. however, demand for serviced apartments slowed significantly over the fourth quarter of 2008, on a consecutive basis, gross rental income from the furnished apartment in the second half was actually lower than that achieved during the first half of 2008.
with the roll out of the renovated rooms and a surge in demand for quality serviced apartments, the group enjoyed growth in both room and occupancy rate in the first half of the year. however, the situation reversed dramatically in the second half of 2008, especially in the fourth quarter, when a lack of new arrivals suppressed occupancy rate to 66% as at end the outlook for the serviced apartment market is expected to be more challenging, as competition will intensify with over 900 units to be launched in 2009, coupled with low levels of demand, we expect vacancies to rise over 2009.
united states commercial excluding the rental income from 150 spear street, which was sold in december 2007, gross rental income from the three office properties in the united states came in flat on a year-on-year basis to hk$117 million in 2008.
longer than expected down time between leases was the key factor contributing to the lackluster performance in 2008. with higher occupancy as at end of 2008, and a below historical average number of leases up for expiry in 2009, an overall higher occupancy rate is anticipated for 2009, and therefore, we expect a steady growth in gross rental income in alongside the new letting of spaces in 2008, one- off re-tenanting cost was incurred, and therefore, combined net rental income from the three us office properties dropped by 19.8% year-on-year in 2008.

in 2008, revenue of our trading division increased by 53.5% year-on-year to hk$172 million, the increase was due to business expansion to trade building materials in the macau market which has markedly deteriorated in the last quarter of 2008. despite the increase in revenue, increased competition has led to lower operating margin. given the increasingly deteriorating global and local economy and other factors, the group felt it should take a prudent approach and has made a provision of hk$56 million against ageing debtors.

equity attributable to shareholders, based on professional valuation of the group s investment properties as of 31 december 2008 and the depreciated costs of the group s hotel properties, amounted to hk$17,975 million as of 31 december 2008. the net assets value at 31 december 2008 represents a drop of hk$7,106 million compared to the value of hk$25,081 million as of 31 december 2007, which is primarily due to the pay out of a special dividend as well as a non- cash mark-to- market diminution in fair value of the group s long- term investment in the champion reit. the resulting gearing ratio at 31 december 2008 was 6%.

the net finance cost of hk$135.5 million incurred in 2008, represents a decrease of hk$286.1 million from the hk$421.6 million for the year, as a result of the decrease in borrowings after receipt of the proceeds from the disposal of the langham place office tower and mall, interest cover for 2008 was 11.79 times, as compared with 3.54 times for 2007.

the financial crisis continues to ravage the global economy, leading it into one of the most severe downturn over the past decades. visibility on the duration and depth of the current economic global downturn remains limited, as well as its impact on the global and hong kong economy. we will be facing unprecedented challenges in 2009, as the contagious effects of the global economy slowdown may spreads further. confidence is generally lacking and it will be some time before liquidity in the lending market as corporate activities slow down, and demand for office space has decreased significantly, there will inevitably be pressure on vacancy and rental rate for office properties in hong kong in the foreseeable term.
the outlook for properties in the central business district will be particularly unclear as redundancy in the banking industry increases. that however should have a limited impact on the performance of our investment in the 49%-owned champion reit in 2009. the full- year contribution of income from the langham place mall and office tower and the relative resilience of retail leasing activities there should make up for the potential earnings softness at the citibank plaza it is noted that champion reit has amended its distribution policy in march 2009 which allows it to reduce its payout from 100% to 90% of its total distributable income. should champion reit reduce its distribution, it will affect the dividend income of the as for the group s hotel portfolio, a deteriorating global economy will further dampen demand for both leisure and corporate travels. continuing the negative trends experienced in the fourth quarter of 2008, further deterioration in market conditions are seen thus far this year, and operating results have weakened significantly in january and february in all markets that we operate in. controlling costs and rationalizing capital spending will be a priority for our hotel business in 2009. in the meantime, we will continue to prudently allocate resources to build the we expect our three hotels in hong kong, which account for more than 60% of the group s hotel profit, to perform relatively better than the other international hotels, given an anticipated higher volume of banqueting business to partially offset lower demand for rooms. the renovated rooms at langham hong kong, as well as those at eaton hotel will offer some buffer against room rates decline.
however, operating profit is expected to drop.
after more than a year of renovation work at langham london, full launch of the rooms will be in mid- 2009, and we should expect this hotel to make profit contribution in 2009. other overseas hotels are expecting to see declining yield as the impact of the downturn will materialize throughout 2009.
with our very strong balance sheet and low financial gearing, we are well prepared to face the economic challenges ahead. we will maintain a high degree of financial discipline and will take actions where necessary in anticipation of changing market lo ka shui chairman and managing director hong kong, 23 march 2009
