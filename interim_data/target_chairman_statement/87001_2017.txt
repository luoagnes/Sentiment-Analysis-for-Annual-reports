chairmans statementthe missions in 2017 are to maximize organic growth from our fl agship asset beijing oriental plaza; to revamp chongqing metropolitan oriental plaza through the on-going asset enhancement programme and to integrate two newly acquired hotels into our growing portfolio of quality assets.
the year 2016 was characterised by global economic volatility and political change. amidst a backdrop of a challenging macro environment, a slower economic growth, a softening retail market and a change in tax policies in china, hui xian reit continues to make progress in 2016.
results and distribution
the total revenue for the period from 1 january 2016 to 31 december 2016 (reporting period) was rmb3,106 million, slightly higher than the previous year. the amount was affected by the implementation of value added tax (vat), effective from 1 may 2016. excluding the impact of vat reform, total revenue would have grown 3.4% yearon-year.
net property income (npi) was rmb2,074 million, a year-on-year increase of 1.9%. the amount was impacted by the change in real estate tax regulations affecting beijing, effective from 1 july 2016. excluding the impact of the additional real estate tax provision for beijing oriental plaza, npi would have increased 5.9% year-on-year.
the amount available for distribution for the reporting period was rmb1,546 million, up by 4.5% year-on-year. the distribution per unit (dpu) for the second half of the year was rmb0.1315. together with the interim dpu, the total dpu for the year increased 2.0% year-on-year to rmb0.2754. the distribution yield was 8.8% based on the closing unit price of rmb3.14 on 30 december 2016.
excluding the impact of vat reform and the additional real estate tax provision for beijing oriental plaza, the amount available for distribution, distributions to unitholders and dpu would have increased 8.5%, 7.5% and 5.9% year-onyear 
business environment in china
according to the national bureau of statistics of china, the countrys gross domestic product (gdp) grew 6.7% in 2016, the slowest growth recorded since 1990. total retail sales of consumer goods reached rmb33,232 billion in 2016, up by 10.4% year-on-year.
cooling economic growth and the central governments ongoing anti-extravagance policy continue to impact consumers spending on luxury goods. many luxury retailers reported reduced revenues and consolidated their retails networks in light of shrinking demand.
the growth of online shopping, supported by convenient mobile payment and low logistics costs, is resulting in a structural change to chinas retail market and changing traditional consumer behavior trends. consumer spending has been shifting from physical retail outlets to online purchases, adversely affecting the traffi c and sales at bricks and mortar stores. during 2016, chinas online retail sales of physical goods grew by 25.6% year-on-year to rmb4,194 billion, accounting for about 12.6% of the countrys total retail sales of consumer goods according to offi cial statistics.
traditional sales retail model would continue to be challenged by on-line shopping.
rmb exchange rate
the rmb exchange rate against hong kong dollars has declined by approximately 6.3%* since the end of 2015. this has impacted both market and investor sentiment towards rmb-denominated assets. according to the hong kong monetary authority, rmb deposits in hong kong as at the end of 2016 dropped 36% year-on-year from rmb851.1 billion to rmb546.7 billion.
all of hui xian reits projects are located in china, hence generating income in rmb. as an rmb-denominated reit, the fi nancial statements of hui xian reit are presented in rmb and its distribution to unitholders is also in rmb. the rmb exchange rate fl uctuation, therefore, does not have signifi cant impact on the performance of hui xian reits projects. however, as its current borrowings are in hong kong dollars, the rmb exposure may appear when the exchange gain or loss is realised upon loan repayment.
