following hai xia finance holdings limited's introduction as the founding and majorshareholder of the company in 2002, four international strategic shareholders joined the company over the past five years, namely china petroleum & chemical corporation, gail (india) limited, oman oil company, s.a.o.c. and asian development bank. through interactive communication and cooperation, our business has undergone a more diversified development, rendering the company an ideal business cooperation platform between domestic and overseas energy companies.

apart from the appointment of mr. mark gelinas as the non-executive director of the company in july 2007, there was no change to the composition of the board during the financial, year over the past year, the board operated smoothly and all the board members actively participated in board meetings as wellas discussed and exchanged views from time to time on matters relating to the business development direction and financingof the group as wellas industry trend and state policies. i strongly believe that such composition of our board will, forsure, drive the business momentum forthe group. we will continue to ensure the board to maintain high standards of governance and leverage on its expertise and experience to lead the group to become a global natural gas company.
snowstorm and sichuan earthquake
in late january 2008, a series of snowstorms hit most of the areas in the prc when most of the expressways were blocked due to heavy snow. road transport was severely affected. many infrastructure facilities including electric cables were damaged. the group, as one of the major gas providers in the prc, has to ensure stable, safe and continuous gas supply amidst such severe weather conditions. to achieve this, ourfrontline staff worked around the clock and made every effort to guarantee continuous gas supply to the users in these affected areas. during that period, no facilities of the group were damaged as a result of the snowstorm, nor did our gas supply experience any interruption. i would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to all our frontline staff for their hard work and commitments during the snowstorm.
the catastrophic earthquake that struck sichuan in mid-may 2008 has caused hundreds of thousands of people dead or missing, and resulted in substantial economic loss to the society. people from various regions of the prc and from all around the world reached out their helping hands to raise funds forthe sichuan victims. ourstaff in different regions of the prc also actively participated in the fundraising activities, and raised and remitted more than rmb3 miqon within such a short period of time.

over the past financial, year, apart from further investment in the downstream city gas projects and the midstream long distance gas pipeline projects, the group's investment strategies also focused on strengthening the investment in the upstream natural gas supply market. we invested in a coal bed methane project in inner mongolia. recently, we have also acquired zhejiang zhongyou hua dian group which is principally engaged in the procurement, import, storage and distribution of liquefied petroleum gas.

going forward, in terms of city gas distribution, the group will continue to actively seek investment opportunities for gas projects in large and medium-sized cities with reasonable investment returns in the coming financialyean for upstream natural gas development and distribution, we will commence our lpg wholesale and retail business after completion of our acquisition of zhejiang zhongyou hua dian group by making use of its existing loading and storage capacities and distribution network as wellas the license granted by the ministry of commerce to the group in december 2006 to engage in the impo 0texpo 0t and wholesale of fuels such as natural gas, liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas (lpg), methanol and dimethyl ether in the prc. this move will facilitate the group to further improve its gas supply system and expand its gas user base, thereby substantially enhancing the group's sustainable income and profit growth.
amid escalating inflation and soaring energy prices all over the world, it will have a considerable impact on the fast-growing economy of china. under such macro-economic environment, the future development of the group will face both challenges and opportunities. given the roaring oil. prices, the group expects that most customers, especially industrial users will shift to natural gas from other fuels as the domestic natural gas price is far below the price of the equivalently-valued petroleum and pet 0o byproducts, generating substantial growth potential forthe fuel gas business of the group. in addition, in preparation for 2008 beijing olympics over the years, there isan increasing concern and awareness for environmental protection among the central government and regional governments as wellas the general public. this has encouraged the use of clean energy, resulting in unprecedented recognition and support from the government and thepublicfortheapplication of natural gas in various areas.
the group has always placed high regards on its reliable, safe and clean gas supply and quality services to our customers. we manage our facilities in each place of business in a responsible manner, aiming to provide quality living standard and actively participating in social activities there. we have been ableto gain the support from these local governments and customers in our places of operation. the group is fully aware of the importance and impact of corporate social responsibility. in the days ahead, the group will continue to strengthen its social responsibilities through different forms of activities.
lastly, i would like to express my thanks to ourstaff, the management team and the fellow board members fo 0thei 0endeavors and hard work, lam also grateful to our shareholders fo 0thei 0full support of our business strategies, aswellasto the banking community and investors for their confidence, encouragement and recognition.
