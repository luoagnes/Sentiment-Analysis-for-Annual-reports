the increase in underlying profit from hk$6,348 million in 2013 to hk$7,152 million in 2014 principally reflected increased income from retail and office investment properties, and higher trading profits from the sale of luxury residential properties in hong kong. underlying profit from property investment increased by 8%. this reflected positive rental reversions in hong kong and higher rental income from properties in mainland china. there were better performances in 2014 from our hotels in hong kong and the u.k. our hotels in mainland china recorded reduced losses.
gross rental income was hk$10,320 million in 2014 compared to hk$9,676 million in 2013.
there were positive rental reversions in the hong kong portfolio. our office occupancy levels were relatively resilient in 2014 despite demand being generally weak, particularly from financial institutions. demand for retail space in hong kong continued to be robust, although there was a slowdown in retail sales in 2014. in mainland china, retail sales of luxury goods were weak. retailers were cautious about taking more space. nevertheless, rental income increased at our taikoo hui, taikoo li sanlitun and indigo properties and occupancy was stable.
operating profit from property trading increased in 2014, principally because we sold more units at our hong kong developments.

in hong kong, demand for office space, particularly from financial institutions, is likely to remain subdued. as a result rents will be under pressure in the central district of hong kong. pacific place, however, has no major leases expiring in 2015 and occupancy rates are expected to remain stable. at taikoo place and cityplaza, rents are expected to remain resilient owing to high occupancy. in guangzhou and beijing, office rents are expected to be under pressure in 2015 as a substantial supply of new office space demand for luxury goods in hong kong has weakened. but overall retail sales in hong kong are expected to grow modestly in 2015. demand for retail space at prime locations and well-managed shopping malls is expected to remain high. in guangzhou and beijing, demand for luxury goods has weakened but that for mid-price products is expected to grow satisfactorily. retailers are cautious about expanding. in chengdu, the retail market is expected to grow steadily in 2015, reflecting demand from consumers for international and local branded goods.

in hong kong, there is demand for luxury residential properties but there are not many transactions. our profits from property trading are still expected to be significant in 2015, with the completion of the sales of presold units in the arezzo development, the sales of completed houses at the 160 south lantau road development and the sales of remaining units at other completed residential developments. profits are also expected on the completion of the sales of the presold office tower (pinnacle one) at the daci temple project in chengdu in mainland china.
the performance of our hotels in hong kong is expected to be stable in 2015. trading conditions for our hotels in mainland china remain challenging because of oversupply.
on behalf of the shareholders and my fellow directors, i wish to express our appreciation to all our employees, whose commitment and hard work have been central to our hong kong, 19th march 2015
