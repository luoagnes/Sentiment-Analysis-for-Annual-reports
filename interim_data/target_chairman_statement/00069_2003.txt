the group s strategic focus has been to build on its brand strength in mainland china where it currently owns andor operates 17 hotels. the economic fundamentals of the mainland china remain very strong and both international arrivals and domestic travel have been growing rapidly. increasingly, manufacturing capacities are being relocated into the country because of comparative cost advantages and availability of skill sets. the country s accession to the world trade organisation, its success in being awarded the staging of the 2008 olympic games and the 2010 world expo will provide further impetus to its economic growth. concurrently, the per capita gdp growth, increasing disposable incomes and aspirational needs of its citizens is underpinning a growing demand for luxury hotel the group remains optimistic about the future potential for hotel business in mainland china and to this end continues to actively pursue investment and management contract opportunities. the group also believes that its growing brand dominance in the country will, over time, benefit its hotels elsewhere in asia as increasing numbers of mainland chinese travel overseas.
the performance of the group s hotels outside mainland china is predicated on the recovery of the regional economies and the global economy which has been characterised by recessionary trends, security concerns and more recently, the escalating political crisis in the middle east. the negative sentiment triggered by these developments have dampened business and leisure travel to and within the region. however, with limited if any, addition to hotel supply in the competitive set anticipated in most locations within the region, the group s hotels should benefit from the operational leverage inherent in this business when these economies turn around.
