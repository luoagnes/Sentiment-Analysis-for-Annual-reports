distribution per unit ( dpu ) rose 2.6% year-on-year to rmb0.2455, representing a distribution yield of 6.36% based on the closing unit price of rmb3.86 on 31 december 2013.

offshore rmb market development denominated in rmb, hui xian reit s outlook is closely linked to the development of offshore rmb market as well as the pace of rmb internationalisation.
hong kong was the fi rst offshore market to launch rmb business back in 2004 and remarkable progress has been witnessed in the decade following. the city remains the world s biggest and most liquid offshore rmb centre, with its offshore rmb deposits surging 43% year-on-year to rmb860.5 billion as at the end of december 2013. cities such as london, singapore, taipei, tokyo and sydney are also rapidly expanding their rmb businesses and competing to become key offshore rmb hubs.
since the listing of hui xian reit in 2011, an extensive array of rmb fi nancial products have been launched in hong kong, including rmb loans; securities products such as bonds and equities; and insurance policies, all offering various investment yields, in addition to rmb currency appreciation. in 2013, the exchange rate of rmb against the hong kong dollar has appreciated about 3.1%*.
business environment in china china s economy maintained its growth momentum in 2013. gross domestic product ( gdp ) in 2013 rose 7.7% year-on-year to rmb56.9 trillion. retail sales, a key indicator of consumer spending, increased 13.1% year-on-year to rmb23.44 trillion. beijing s gdp recorded 7.7% year-on-year growth to rmb1.95 trillion.

hui xian reit s portfolio comprises two properties: (1) oriental plaza, a 800,000 square metre mixed-use development in beijing (which consists of the malls, the tower offi ces, the tower apartments and grand hyatt beijing); and (2) sofi tel shenyang lido, a fi ve-star hotel in shenyang. the appraised value of hui xian reit s properties was rmb37,040 million as at 31 december 2013.
hui xian reit s retail, offi ce and serviced apartment sectors delivered solid organic growth during the reporting period. the hotel sector, however, continued to face challenges and keen competitions.
total revenue of hui xian reit s portfolio increased 2.4% year-on-year to rmb2,710 million. npi grew 5.6% year-on- year to rmb1,764 million.

in 2013, disposable income per capita of beijing s urban residents grew by 10.6% year-on-year to rmb40,321. the capital city s retail sales increased 8.7% year-on-year to rmb838 billion. demand for retail space at prime locations and well-managed shopping centres remained fi rm in beijing.
the malls at oriental plaza, situated in the prime wangfujing area, has maintained its position as a sought-after location for both domestic and international retailers. its well-balanced tenant mix, which spans from mass market products to luxury brands, continues to be a draw for shoppers.
the retail portfolio s npi increased 14.9% year-on-year to rmb858 million. the average monthly passing rent rose 10.1% year-on-year to rmb1,035 per square metre. rental reversion was 15.8%. the average occupancy rate was offi ce portfolio after seeing accelerated rental increases during 2010 and 2012, the grade a offi ce leasing market in beijing has softened slightly in 2013. nonetheless, supply remained limited.

leasing demand for the tower offi ces at oriental plaza has continued unabated and a high occupancy level was maintained. strong growth in passing rent and positive rental reversion were also recorded, refl ecting the rent escalation of beijing offi ce market over the past three years.
the offi ce portfolio s npi was rmb681 million, an increase of 20.0% over 2012. the average monthly passing rent increased 20.7% year-on-year to rmb234 per square metre. the average monthly spot rent was down by 18.9% year-on-year to rmb255 per square metre. rental reversion was 24.2%. the average occupancy rate was 93.5%.
given the high occupancy rate which leaves limited space to be offered for recruitment of new tenants, the majority of the leasing activities in 2013 were renewals. as rentals of renewal leases tend to be lower than those of new leases, a year-on-year decrease in spot rent was recorded. however, lease renewals offer hui xian reit a steady income stream and occupancy rate; avoiding the loss of revenue which arises from vacancy gaps.
serviced apartment portfolio during 2013, leasing demand for well-located luxury serviced apartments in beijing was stable while supply was featuring over 600 fully-furnished units over two blocks, the tower apartments at oriental plaza s average occupancy rate was 82.3% in 2013. npi continued to grow, with a year-on-year increase of 4.8% to rmb63 million.

the operating environment remained challenging for china s hotel industry throughout the reporting period. at the beginning of 2013, the extreme cold weather and the outbreak of human avian fl u in several provinces caused the contraction of business and tourist arrivals, as well as cancellation of conferences and corporate events.
moreover, the central government s new policy of restrictions on entertainment and hospitality also led to the cancellation or scaling down of corporate entertainment and banquets, business meetings and government-driven as a result of these market headwinds, the npi of hui xian reit s hotel portfolio (comprising grand hyatt beijing at oriental plaza and sofi tel shenyang lido) declined by 45.3% year-on-year to rmb162 million.
grand hyatt beijing s average room rate per night for 2013 was down by 5.1% year-on-year to rmb1,746. revenue per available room ( revpar ) decreased 17.4% year-on-year to rmb948 and the average occupancy rate for the year was 54.3%.

on 1 january 2013, hui xian reit s hotel in shenyang was rebranded as sofi tel shenyang lido and has since been managed by sofi tel luxury hotels. the boom in hotel openings prior to the commencement of the 12th national games of the people s republic of china in august 2013 has mounted increasing challenges on existing hotels, applying further pressure on both room rates and occupancy levels.
sofi tel shenyang lido s average occupancy rate for the year was 41.5%. the average room rate per night decreased 17.2% year-on-year to rmb680; and revpar was down by 46.0% year-on-year to rmb282.

asset enhancement is a key part of hui xian reit s continuous efforts to stay competitive. the asset enhancement programme for grand hyatt beijing has made good progress to date and half of the hotel rooms have undergone renovation, offering a fresh new look and upgraded amenities. the renovation programme for sofi tel shenyang lido is strong financial position hui xian reit has maintained a strong fi nancial position over the reporting period. as at 31 december 2013, bank balances and cash on hand amounted to rmb3,740 million and debts amounted to rmb3,217 million. debts to gross asset value ratio was 7.9%. we believe that hui xian reit will have the fi nancial fl exibility and capacity to seize market opportunities when they arise.

looking ahead in 2014, we will continue to capitalise on our existing competitive advantages to fuel organic growth from our current portfolio. our goals are to achieve rental growth and improve operational performances by implementing active asset management and enhancement strategies.
concurrently, we will continue to actively pursue yield-accretive acquisition opportunities in china. our focus is on acquiring quality assets which have the potential to enhance hui xian reit s portfolio as well as deliver long-term benefi ts for unitholders.
as the offshore rmb market continues to grow and sentiment towards rmb remains positive, we believe that there is signifi cant potential for the further expansion of the rmb investment market. any such growth would be positive for the prospects of hui xian reit.

chairman s statement after three decades of rapid economic growth that has been heavily reliant on exports and investments, china is now in the process of reshaping its economy with a focus on expanding domestic consumption. we believe that such a shift would help the world s second largest economy to maintain sustainable and healthy growth in the long-term.
on behalf of the manager, i would like to thank all unitholders and the trustee for their continued support and commitment for hui xian reit.
