looking ahead in 2017, the us dollar will remain on the track of interest rate hike, and will maintain its upward trend in the middle term regardless of the short-term readjustment driven by trump administrations export promotion policy, imposing the liquidity outflow impact on hong kong, mainland china and other emerging markets. moreover, the global market is expected to undergo more volatility in 2017 due to the expanding trade frictions between china and the united states since donald trump took office, the unclear impact from the follow-up development of brexit and the unpredictable outcomes of the presidential elections of france and germany.
after the 19th national congress is concluded, the economy of the mainland china will hopefully bottom out. however, its economic growth rate will be affected by the shifts of american policy and other external factors. it is expected that chinas monetary policy will remain prudent and neutral. and its proactive fiscal policy is an important option for the policymakers. in general, we hold a prudent and optimistic view about the prospect of chinas economic growth.
in 2017, our business will witness more growth opportunities coming from three factors: the rising financing demand brought by overseas mergers and acquisitions and international development of the mainland enterprises, chinese residents growing demand for overseas assets allocation and the rapid implementation of the governments one belt and one road strategy. as a large-scale overseas business platform of guotai junan securities co.,ltd., we have strong support from the parent company. we will take the opportunity of ipo for h shares of parent company in hong kong to further strengthen our own cross-boarder investing and financing services, and strive to explore the international emerging markets such as the southeast asia market in addition to enriching our services in hong kong market. furthermore, we will improve our comprehensive ability in financial services in order to provide diversified financial products and high-quality financing solutions for our corporate, institutional and individual clients.
