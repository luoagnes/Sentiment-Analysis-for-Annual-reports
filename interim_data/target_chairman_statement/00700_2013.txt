annual report 2012 5 business review and outlook 2012 was a year of challenge and change, during which tencent sharpened its focus on mobile internet experiences.
from a macro perspective, china experienced slower gdp growth amid economic uncertainties in europe and the us.
china s internet user growth continued to decelerate during the year as the scale of internet user base expanded further and penetration reached 42% at the end of 2012 according to china internet network information center, limiting the simple growth brought about by new internet users. nevertheless, engagement per user increased further as the internet deepened its penetration into users daily lives and the value chains of different business sectors in china. as a result, business opportunities available on the internet continued to broaden. we have been and will continue making substantial investment in our platforms and services to better serve our users and to catalyse the emergence of these business opportunities.
during the year, there was a significant shift in user activity from pc to mobile, driven by rapid expansion of china s mobile internet user base, enhanced capabilities of smartphones and increased adoption of compelling mobile applications. offering a revolutionary user experience, the mobile internet is reshaping existing business models and the industry value chain. against this backdrop, tencent and some peers have been aggressively investing in products and marketing to build their mobile user base, although business models on the mobile internet remain uncertain and, in areas such as advertising and value-added services, monetisation lags behind traffic growth.
2012 witnessed the continued evolution of other major internet sectors in china. for the online games sector, mobile games and web games increasingly supplemented client games as drivers of industry user growth, albeit from a relatively low base. in the online advertising sector, advertisers shifted part of their spending to video advertising and, more notably, to performance- based social advertising. for the e-commerce sector, b2c competition was intense but showed signs of moderation towards the end of the year, while transaction volumes maintained rapid growth.

overall financial performance we achieved significant growth in revenues and earnings in 2012. our diversified business portfolio, focus on building user platforms, and commitment to creating healthy industry value chains have enabled tencent to remain resilient despite rapid and unpredictable value migration within the internet industry.
ivas. our online game business extended its leadership in china via new game genres, and achieved significant revenue contributions from international markets. for our community and open platforms, the year saw healthy revenue growth, primarily driven by a strong increase in item-based sales within applications on our open platforms.
mvas. the business benefited from revenue growth in mobile games and our bundled sms packages. mobile books also demonstrated promising growth potential.
online advertising. we achieved above-industry-average revenue growth rates, primarily due to performance-based social advertising, as well as market share gains in portal and online video advertising.

6 tencent holdings limited e-commerce transactions. in 2012, we stepped up the scale of our b2c e-commerce transactions business. despite a highly competitive environment, we achieved significant growth in transaction volume and revenues through the year.
in the fourth quarter of 2012, the year-on-year growth rates of our revenues and earnings remained robust.
ivas. on a year-on-year basis, our online game business benefited from increased activity of our major titles, higher contributions from international markets and new self-developed titles launched during 2012. item-based sales on our open platforms enjoyed strong year-on-year revenue growth.
mvas. overall year-on-year revenue growth rate of the business reduced mainly due to slower subscriptions growth for our bundled sms packages. mobile games and mobile books continued to grow significantly compared to the same period last year.
online advertising. the business sustained significant revenue growth on a year-on-year basis, mainly driven by performance-based social advertising, video advertising and search advertising on our e-commerce platforms. traditional brand display advertising also registered solid growth.
e-commerce transactions. principal transactions grew sequentially as a result of seasonal promotions and geographic expansion in southern china from the original eastern china base. transaction volume on our marketplaces also increased on a quarter-on-quarter basis.

in 2012, we established strong presence in a wide range of mobile application categories such as communications, social networking, media, security and browser. we have developed some of china s most popular mobile applications, including wireless qq and weixin. while we will continue to invest aggressively in developing and marketing independent mobile services such as our security product and web browser, we are also organically integrating new applications into weixin, which can enhance our users experience while leveraging their existing social connections.
we reinforced and extended our social leadership during the year, with continued user expansion on our core platforms. we also deepened the integration of these platforms to further improve user engagement and enhanced the mobilisation of pc- oriented platforms to cater for increasing usage of the mobile internet. meanwhile, our open platforms continued to grow and create value for users and third-party developers.
in may 2012, we announced a re-organisation of our business units into six new business groups and a wholly-owned subsidiary focusing on e-commerce business. this allows us to optimise resource allocation, to reinforce our entrepreneurial spirit, execution and innovation, and to sharpen our focus on users needs. each business line continues to leverage company- wide synergies under the new organisational structure.

annual report 2012 7 our business is increasingly benefitting from investments we have made in companies whose products or services are complementary to our own. for example, riot games lol has attained widespread popularity, strengthening our game portfolio in china and broadening our game revenue internationally. during 2012, we continued to selectively invest in companies where we see opportunities for long-term strategic benefits, notably businesses which can supply first-class products into our platforms, and businesses which we see as driving change in the internet industry. for example, we purchased minority stakes in epic games, a us-based development team with a long history of creating popular games and a market-leading game development engine, and in kakao, a leading mobile messaging service provider in korea.
we completed a usd600 million senior unsecured notes offering in september 2012. this is our second international bond issue, following our first tranche in december 2011, reflecting investors confidence in our business model and financial performance. we remain firmly committed to maintaining our strong credit profile and investment grade credit ratings.

8 tencent holdings limited our ivas registered subscriptions count declined during 2012, primarily due to stringent measures we launched in the second quarter, which aimed to improve the quality of our subscriber base by cleaning up certain user accounts acquired through mobile channels, for whom fee collection was unlikely. to cater for users increasing activity on mobile, we are enriching the mobile-related features and privileges of our ivas subscription services.

for certain key services such as qq im, qzone and games, we managed the pc and mobile versions separately in the past. to deliver a unified user experience across platforms, we are now aligning the product development and management of these services between pc and mobile versions.

in view of the increasing integration between the pc and mobile internet, we will combine the ivas and mvas segments in our financial reports and merge related revenue categories under ivas and mvas from the first quarter of 2013 onwards. we believe that this adjustment in financial reporting better reflects current market trends and our future business development.
