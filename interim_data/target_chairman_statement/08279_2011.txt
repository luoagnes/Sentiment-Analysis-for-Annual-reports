chairman s statement agtech has been focusing on the development of the sports lottery business in china since early 2007. after years of efforts, we are pleased to announce a turnaround for the first time for this year with operating profit of approximately hk$700,000. in october last year, the ministry of finance of the prc promulgated two provisional measures to approve lottery sales via internet and phone. under such favorable environment, it is expected that china sports lottery will proactively develop various new games, new distribution channels and new technologies in 2011, thereby bringing a new landscape with robust growth to the prc lottery market. agtech will continue to utilise its solid operation management capability, advanced software and hardware development technologies, client network and leading market position so as to consolidate its existing core lottery management business and proactively seize cooperation opportunities in various areas and make every effort to extend the current profit momentum to new businesses such as virtual sports betting as well as online and phone lottery distribution. we believe that the business growth of the group in the coming year will be booming through the current established comprehensive strengths and its business development capability.
for the year under review, agtech made significant progress in business development, which helped it optimise its sports lottery business framework. in march 2010, we announced the acquisition of an indirect 35% equity interest in got. as got is one of the largest terminal and system providers for sports lottery in the prc, the acquisition marks the furtherance of our business plans in strengthening our supply chain for the prc sports lottery industry, expanding sales network, strengthening research and development capability, enhancing our core competitiveness as well as creating synergy. looking ahead to 2011, as it is expected that there is strong demand for new lottery terminals and new technologies from the slac, the acquisition will help the group capture the potential opportunities which emerge in the market in timely manner, thereby consolidating agtech s leadership position in the prc sports lottery market. in addition, the solid business operation of got will continue to bring about stable cash flow and profit contribution to the group.
