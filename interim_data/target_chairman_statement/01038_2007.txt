international infrastructure investments
our businesses in mainland china delivered commendable performance in 2006, as the nation s gnp continues to grow. the profit contribution from cki s china portfolio increased to hk$869 million.
powering our strong performance was yet another record year for the zhuhai power plant. the profit contribution from units 1 and 2 of the zhuhai power plant reached a new high, surpassing even last year s exceptional results. the siping cogen power plants in jilin also continued to perform well. during the year, the divestment of the qinyang power plants in henan, mainland china was completed, generating a one-off gain. as regards cki s toll road portfolio in mainland china, steady returns were delivered in general, and performances were in line with forecasts.

in cki s newest market, the united kingdom, the performance of our two investments has been pleasing and a profit contribution of hk$316 million was recorded. 2006 represented the first full year of profit contribution from northern gas networks limited ( northern gas networks ), with double-digit cash yields recorded. as regards cambridge water plc ( cambridge water ), healthy returns were generated, exceeding our original budget.

the results from our australian portfolio were adversely affected by the performance of the cross city tunnel and the divestment of our interest in the electricity distribution businesses, with profit contribution reducing to hk$64 million.

annual report 2006 7 traffic levels for the cross city tunnel project, in which cki has a 50 per cent. stake, were significantly lower than expected, leading to an operating loss of hk$262 million being recorded by the group. the project company has been unable to generate sufficient revenue to service its non-recourse project debt, resulting in a receiver being appointed for the project just prior to the year end. cki has accordingly made a further asset impairment of hk$279 million in 2006. the entire book value of the investment has now been fully as for the electricity businesses, our stake was reduced following the divestment of part of our shareholdings in etsa utilities, citipower i pty ltd. and powercor australia limited in 2005. the fundamentals of these power distribution businesses continue to be solid and they have outperformed operating targets for the year.

commencing 2006, the group has also received income and management fees from spark infrastructure by virtue of our 9.9 per cent. stake and our interest in the management contract. envestra limited, one of australia s largest listed natural gas distribution companies in which cki has a 16.4 per cent. stake, continued to generate double-digit cash yields during following a number of challenging years in the materials industry, our infrastructure materials division recorded an encouraging profit of hk$110 million in 2006. market analysts indicate that construction activity in hong kong has reached its bottom, and as a result, better prospects for our materials business are anticipated.
on the whole, our enabling us to deliver continued profit and dividend growth to our a new decade of opportunity
over the last ten years, cki has grown significantly and recorded a number of major corporate milestones.
beginning as a hong kong and mainland china-focused company, we have now evolved into a global infrastructure player with diverse investments in several industries across china, australia and the united kingdom. on the whole, our investments have exceeded expectations, enabling us to deliver continued profit and dividend growth to our shareholders. we have developed an impressive reputation in the infrastructure sector and have ample resources to fund new investments in the future.

this is a rmb6 billion joint venture project in which cki has a 45 per cent. stake and guangdong yudean group co. ltd. and the electric development (group) company of zhuhai special economic zone collectively hold the other 55 per cent. stake. the commissioning will provide immediate profit contribution and boost the group s portfolio in mainland china. the addition of units 3 and 4 greatly enhance the capacity of the zhuhai power plant, increasing total installed capacity from 1,400 mw to 2,600 mw. as the demand for power in the guangdong region continues to grow, we expect the zhuhai power plant to remain one of the star performers in our mainland portfolio for years to come.
cki expects to achieve organic growth and deliver solid returns on our existing investments as we continue on our roadmap of business we expect to see continued organic growth in our energy portfolio in australia as we expand our regulated asset base. growing demand in australia s urban areas and rising returns on an increasing asset base will ensure that these regulated businesses generate strong returns for the group. in addition, we will initiate new strategies to enhance the scope and returns of the non-regulated revenue of these businesses.

divestments to maximise shareholder value as part of our strategy to achieve the best returns for shareholders, we will review our asset portfolio from time to time and prudently consider divesting certain assets when the timing and price is right. on this point, cki is in the process of divesting 21 per cent.
of the lane cove tunnel in australia, with the aim of maximising shareholder value through the generation of cash and a premium, as well as the retention of a share in the future upside through a defined mechanism for revenue sharing. following the divestment exercise, the group s shareholding will be reduced from 40 per cent.
to 19 per cent. the lane cove tunnel is scheduled to open to traffic this year.
