chairman s statement the financial year of 20082009 was a productive year for agtech as we continued to consolidate our business foundation and widen our market presence through various means in the lottery market of china, which has been seeing rapid growth, thanks in part to the growing popularity of lottery across the country, as well as the chinese government s initiatives to nurture a positive operation environment for the industry.
over the past financial year, the group continued its focus on its sports lottery business in mainland china and adopted different strategies to drive growth and strengthen its market share in various business segments. this was in line with its business objective of applying its expertise in lottery software and hardware, and the provision of sports lottery management and marketing consultancy services to the best effect.
as a fully integrated lottery solutions provider in china, agtech s market position remained sound and solid during the financial year. in the fields of retail chain management and marketing consultancy, we have effectively strengthened agtech s presence by supporting and maintaining close ties with our business partners, including china coop, new cooperation joint-stock trade china co., ltd., which is a subordinate cooperative enterprise of china coop and suguo supermarket co., ltd., the largest supermarket chain in jiangsu province.
