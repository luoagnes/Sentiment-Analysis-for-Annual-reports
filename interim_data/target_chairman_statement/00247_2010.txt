prospects the world economy has been improving since the second half of 2009. policy efforts around the world have been taking effect at varying degree. monetary conditions remain accommodative with liquidity flowing into the financial system and helping to restore stability in the sector. governments around the world have been closely monitoring their respective economic situations to ensure a sustainable recovery. despite the occurrence of sovereign debt crisis in some countries in the eurozone in the last quarter of 2009, the coordinated policy efforts by the governments of member states in the european union and the support of intergovernmental organisations have helped the region to weather the difficult time.
the central government of prc has also made tremendous efforts in steering domestic growth from an export-led model to a demand-led model and rebalancing the structure of the economy. policy efforts since the last quarter of 2009 have largely focused on the domestic property market. these measures help ensure a healthy and sustainable property market. corrections in terms of transaction volume and prices have been felt through the second quarter of 2010 confirming the effectiveness of measures taken to restore a more balanced growth to the property sector.
the economic cooperation framework agreement signed in chongqing in june 2010 by the mainland s association for relations across the taiwan straits and taiwan s straits exchange foundation will gradually reduce and remove trade and investment barriers. this will facilitate greater trade flows and closer industrial integration between the mainland and taiwan, creating more business opportunities and benefiting both economies.
the economic growth of hong kong is evident by positive gdp growth for three consecutive quarters with an upward revised forecast in the range of 5% to 6% for the full year of 2010. improving trade flows; salary increases and better bonuses as well as rising visitor arrivals starting in early 2010 have had a stimulating effect in the economy. employment prospects have been improving with many industries and businesses planning to hire more people.
a fruitful year, 2010 has seen the property market reach a number of milestones that lay the foundation for better governance, and a more efficient and transparent market. the new guidelines introduced jointly by hksar government and reda for sales of residential properties help strengthen home-buyers confidence. to sustain a balance in supply and demand, the land supply arrangements with the mtr corporation limited and the urban renewal authority are being fine-tuned, and the pace to bring readily available residential sites from the existing land application list for 20102011 to the market for auction has been increased. the recent land auctions in hong kong have received overwhelming market responses. with low mortgage rates, strong liquidity in the banking sector, willingness of banks to lend for home purchases, continuing interest from mainland buyers, demand for quality housing remains strong.
