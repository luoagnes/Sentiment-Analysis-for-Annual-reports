in 2008, the china s real estate market faced many strenuous tests and impacts in various areas, that resulted in significant market adjustments. in the first half of 2008, the macro-control measures by the central government swept in full force reducing both the price and volume of property market transactions. subsequent natural disasters in china, such as the snowstorms and the major sichuan earthquake, also had an unfavorable market impact. in the second half of 2008, the subprime crisis in u.s.
shattered global financial markets, economies around the world struggled against the threat of recession and the china real estate market inevitably suffered another blow.

solid sales performance underpinned by national brand development natural disasters in the mainland during 2008 indirectly delayed some of our project completion progress. revenue recognition for certain projects, which had already been launched or intended to be launched in the markets by the end of 2008, were postponed respectively until 2009.

sales recorded came from 15 projects, including, inter alia, shanghai shimao sheshan villas, wuhu shimao rivera garden, kunshan shimao butterfly bay and beijing shimao olive garden. revenue from sales in new projects across second and third tier cities accounted for more contribution to the group, achieving results gradually from greater efforts made by the group to invest in economically prosperous and rapid developing regions.

smooth progress of restructuring enhancing
the restructuring proposal involving injection of 10 commercial projects of the group into shanghai shimao co., ltd. ( shanghai shimao ) as officially approved by the china securities regulatory commission on 3 september 2008 is an important milestone for the group, which signifies the group s access to the a-share market and broadened funding sources. restructuring is estimated to be completed by the first half of 2009, upon which the group will not only own an independent and professional commercial property group, but will also be able to raise funds through the chinese equity and debt markets through an independent financing platform. this allows more effective fund raising at a lower cost to aid development and strengthen liquidity of the group, while we focus our resources on facilitating the pace of development of future residential and hotel businesses.
optimizing corporate governance and bearing
sound corporate management will help the group address challenges from the current difficult market environment.
by clearly delineating the corporate control and governance structure, instituting a professional team of management, optimizing the internal management system of the corporation and implementing incentive mechanisms with proven track-records, the group is committed to the enhancement of corporate governance standards, so as to strengthen the cohesion and competitiveness of the additionally, the group adhered to its belief that corporate citizens owe an obligation to society. in 2008, as severe snowstorms whipped through the china mainland, shimao property immediately answered national call for aid relief and donated hk$10 million to the china charity foundation for rescue and reconstruction of the affected areas. later in the year, shimao property not only donated rmb10 million emergency funds after the 8.0 scale earthquake in wenchuan, sichuan, but also contributed rmb100 million for the construction of 100 shimao caring hospitals na_b in the worst-hit zones, including sichuan, gansu and shaanxi, etc., thereby giving direct support to the earthquake victims.

future plans and goals 2008 was a difficult year; looking forward to 2009, market conditions will continue to be challenging. the consolation is that the central government has decisively promulgated a series of economic stimulus measures and reinstated real estate industry as an important core business supporting the national economy. beginning in the fourth quarter, after taking into account of the financial and real estate market conditions, central and regional governments successively issued various measures to stimulate domestic demand and stabilize market conditions, including a total of five central bank interest rate cuts, lowering deed tax rates, waiving stamp duty on property transactions and delaying payments of land premium. with the support of these measures, we believe the overall market will gradually regain momentum with government s measures to stimulate the property market gradually taking effect and a certain level of purchasing power accumulated through the weak sales performance as shown in 2008, the group remains cautiously optimistic about the future as demands will be driven by actual end-users. in respect of hotel property and commercial property, the group believes the world expo 2010 to be held in shanghai would spur the performance of hotel businesses and provide a boost to shimao property with its highly-reputed hotel properties that have amassed wide recognition by domestic and international consumers. on the other hand, the acceleration of modernization and economic development in china over the years will expand demands for quality commercial properties and therefore create a beneficial environment for commercial property businesses.
to cope with forthcoming challenges and capture future opportunities, shimao property will review financing progress and market conditions and accordingly continue reorganization of the hotel business and further implement a development mode spearheaded by three principal businesses. centralizing the management of residential, commercial and hotel properties under dedicated management teams with equal competence on three different platforms will unlock the the potential values and enhance management expertise in each business, thereby giving the group an extra competitive edge for long-term on 9 april 2009, the group succeeded in placing new shares with net proceeds of hk$1.9 billion. following the completion of the placing, repayment of syndicated loans and the restructuring proposal involving injection of commercial projects into shanghai shimao, the financial position of the group is expected to be improved through the enlargement of equity base and reduction of debt level, which will be beneficial to the operations and business development of the group in the long run.
