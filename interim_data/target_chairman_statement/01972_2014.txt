the decrease in underlying profit from hk$6,935 million in 2012 to hk$6,348 million in 2013 principally reflects lower trading profits from the sale of luxury residential properties in hong kong, partially offset by increased investment income from retail and office properties.
underlying profit from property investment increased by 10%. this reflects positive rental reversions in hong kong and higher rental income from the mainland china properties. there were better performances in 2013 from the upper house in hong kong and from the u.k. hotels.
however, this was more than offset by weaker results from the hotels in mainland china.
gross rental income was hk$9,676 million in 2013 compared to hk$9,015 million in 2012. there were positive rental reversions in the hong kong office portfolio. occupancy levels during the year were relatively resilient despite demand for office space being generally weak in 2013, particularly from financial institutions. demand for retail space in hong kong continued to be robust during 2013. in mainland china, taikoo hui and taikoo li sanlitun recorded good growth of rental income in 2013. occupancy levels at taikoo hui mall and taikoo li sanlitun were stable during the year. retail sales continued to grow and demand for retail space remained good, notwithstanding a modest increase in the supply of new retail space.
operating profit from property trading decreased due to fewer sales of units at the azura development, partially offset by sales of units at the argenta development. in 2013, trading profits were recognised on 21 azura units and 12 argenta units. in 2012, 98 azura units on an attributable basis, net investment property valuation gains in 2013, after deferred tax relating to investment properties in mainland china, were hk$6,425 million, compared to net gains of hk$12,184 million in 2012.

net debt as at 31st december 2013 was hk$32,014 million, compared with hk$28,921 million as at 31st december 2012. gearing increased by 0.8 percentage points from 15.0% to 15.8%.
the increase in borrowings was mainly due to the funding required for the development of the brickell city centre project in miami and the acquisition of the kowloon bay commercial site in hong kong. cash and undrawn committed facilities totalled hk$9,854 million as at 31st december 2013, compared with hk$9,278 million as at 31st december 2012. we will continue to refinance (as necessary on maturity) inter-group funding provided by swire pacific and will do so on a stand-alone basis without recourse to swire pacific.

pacific place, however, has no major leases expiring in 2014 and occupancy rates are expected to remain stable. at island east, rents are expected to remain resilient owing to high occupancy. in guangzhou, rents are expected to be under pressure due to the large amount of existing and new supply of office space. there is expected to be limited new supply of office space in beijing in 2014. as a result, occupancy rates are expected to hong kong retail sales are expected to grow, albeit more slowly than in 2013. demand for retail space at prime locations and well-managed shopping malls is expected to continue to increase. in guangzhou, demand for new space from luxury retailers has slowed reflecting the effect of government measures which have affected the consumption of luxury goods. in beijing, retailers of international brands are continuing to look for space in prime locations and well-managed malls.
