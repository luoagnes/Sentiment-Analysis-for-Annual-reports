amid the current steep downturn of the global economy, the three major economies of the world namely the united states, europe and japan are all in recession. for the prc, the measures to stimulate domestic demand put in place by the government has started to yield results, and its gdp is still likely to record growth. we remain optimistic that the market for instant products will have a positive growth generally. looking into 2009, as the global economy is not expected to turnaround in the near term, and despite the prc may sustain an economic growth under the government s policies to expand domestic demand, the operation of enterprises will continue to face considerable challenges and adaptation issues.
every economic crisis is a survival of the fi ttest test for business operations. those who can adapt and restructure their operation more rapidly will remain and come out of the crisis stronger. having operated and been exposed to tests in the china market for years, the operation team of uni-president china holdings ltd.
