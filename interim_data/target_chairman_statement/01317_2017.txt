the overall target set in our fifth five-year plan for the 20152016 to the 20192020 school years (the fifth five-year plan) is to reach total student enrolment of more than 40,000 by the end of the 20192020 school year. this student enrolment target remains unchanged. we expects to achieve a target of running more than 70 schools in at least 20 cities in china by the end of the 20182019 school year and complete its national layout of school locations as set out in the fifth five-year plan.
under our school development plan for the 20172018 and 20182019 school years, we will continue to open more middle and elementary schools in those second and third tier cities in china for providing feeders to our high schools located in nearby cities. in this regard, the asset light model by partnering with public or private entities remains our focused strategy.
moreover, we plan to set up preschools in each of the cities where it operates maple leaf schools. we will also explore some potential acquisition opportunities in china which will create a synergy with the group and fit the educational philosophy of maple leaf.
we will consider opening schools in first tier cities in china, including beijing and shenzhen within the next two school years.
apart from the expansion plan in china, the board is of the view that overseas expansion is part of our long term growth strategies. we can see the growing demand for bilingual english and chinese education in belt and road (the belt and road) countries. the group believes we have unique advantages in filling up the gap of demand for quality international k-12 education along the belt and road. our students in china will benefit from a global presence of maple leaf brand schools.
the board is confident to maintain the groups leading position as an international school operator in china by combining the merits of both western and chinese educational philosophies.
