we strengthened our leading position in embedded non-volatile memory, especially for smart cards and mcus, power discrete, power management and sensors. the company successfully rolled out its 0.11m ultra-low-leakage ( ull ) embedded flash memory platform, which supports integrated rf-cmos and represents one of the best solutions to mcu applications in the internet of things.
the 90nm eflasheeeprom process platform began manufacturing ics for next generation smart cards, including secure financial cards. the prospects for this advanced technology are very promising. as for discretes, we focused on emerging applications and implemented next generation super junction mosfet and igbt with better performance.
our more advanced ultra high voltage ( uhv ) 700v bcd technology provides led lighting applications with solutions that require less energy consumption at lower costs.
amid an increasing demand for ics for emerging green energy, the internet of things and automotive electronics, we will offer a green ic manufacturing platform that has low energy consumption and high performance efficiency in smaller dimensions. we will take full advantage of these growing market opportunities, expand strategically, maintain and improve our key differentiators, all supporting profitable growth and maintaining our competitiveness in the 200mm wafer foundry industry.
one of the economic targets of the present chinese government s 13th five-year plan (2016-2020) is to have the chinese semiconductor industry be among the leaders in the global economy. the company shall strive to be a significant contributor to the achievement of this goal and, at the same time, work to realize benefits from the ongoing support of the government for our industry.
