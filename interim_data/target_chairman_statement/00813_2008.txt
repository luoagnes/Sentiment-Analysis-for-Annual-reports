as reported during the first meeting of the 11th national people s congress, the central government estimated an approximately 8% gdp growth for 2008, while inflation will be controlled at around 4.8% by the implementation of a prudent fiscal policy and a relatively tight monetary policy, as continuity and stability in fiscal policies remains the primary concern for the government. while we expect a challenging market environment, we believe that the aim of the government in regulating the property sector is to prevent any significant fluctuations in property prices from adversely affecting the economy and the livelihood of the people, rather than inflection of the sector. we expect government regulation of the property market in a more stable and mature manner this year, as reasonable price movements in the property market should represent the most ideal result for the government.
nevertheless, we anticipate a period of consolidation for the domestic property market given tightened money supply. certain small and medium-sized property companies may have difficulties in carrying on business under such austere market conditions and be obliged to sell ongoing projects to larger companies with strong balance sheet and resources to ensure completion of these projects. as a company that has been following a prudent and conservative financial policy, shimao property is well-positioned to expand its portfolio of projects by capitalising on these opportunities. meanwhile, we will continue to expand our land bank by acquiring premium land sites at competitive prices in a prudent and disciplined future plans and goals injecting commercial property projects of shimao property into the a-share market was confirmed during the year under review. currently in 2008, the company is undertaking a restructuring exercise to restructure its hotel business, the completion of which will take the group to a new stage of business development where the residential, commercial and hotel segments will be operated under different management team to fully implement a development pattern spearheaded by three principal businesses.
the new structure will better realise the inherent value of each individual business segment and allow professional operation and management, thereby reinforcing and further enhancing our existing foundations and competitive edge for sustainable and stable business development.
the group will continue to focus on key areas in the yangtze delta region and the bohai bay region while increase investments in prosperous and thriving second and third-tier cities such as wuhan, hangzhou, shenyang, dalian, yantai, suzhou, ningbo, jinan, qingdao and chengdu. the demand for quality real estate in these cities will continue to grow in tandem with higher living standards and spending powers. on the back of its growing brand value, we are confident that the group will enjoy growing recognition.
our target for this year is to generate a total of rmb18.5 billion from contracted sales and investment properties, representing a growth of over 85% versus 2007, and to complete and deliver properties with a total gfa of approximately 2.5 million sq.m. we will continue to optimise our management structure and advance our business development in a stable manner to achieve our target for the year, as we remain resolutely determined to realise the goal of becoming a leading property developer.
all in all, the group is focused on positive and stable long-term development. to this end, we will pursue balanced growth in our development strategies to aim at growing brand recognition, customer loyalty, product and service innovation, and optimisation of management systems and processes with a view to ongoing improvement of product and service quality in tandem with the healthy development of the group. in combination with financial and brand advantages, the group will aspire to deliver in terms of customer, brand, business scale, return for shareholders, professional duty and social duty, joining hands with our shareholders to embrace a on behalf of the board, i would like to thank our staff for their dedication and enthusiasm, which has been the driving force behind shimao property s growth. i would also like to thank our shareholders for supporting the group and sharing its vision and strategy for future development. we at shimao property pledge to repay shareholders trust by giving our best to generate lucrative return for shareholders, as we continue to embark on new ventures and pursue excellence in all areas.
