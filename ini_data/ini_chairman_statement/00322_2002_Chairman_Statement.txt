During the year, instant noodle factories in Harbin, beverage factories in Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Shenyang and Chongqing obtained ISO9002 status.
At present, 19 factories under the Group have been granted ISO certificates. The Directors are proud of the Group s tradition of producing high-quality food products.

In 2001, the Group made a donation to Bai-Yin city government in Gansu Province for supporting a re-fresh water project. By setting up 4 fresh- water collecting stations, eight thousands people s fresh-water supply problem has been solved. In the intense cold winter, the Group donated instant noodles to the famine-stricken people in Inner Mongolia.
Donation was also given to the Tianjin Charity Association to provide emergency necessaries to poor people in the area.

As a result of the commencement of production by the factories in Qingdao and Fuzhou under the instant noodle division, the re- commencement of production by the Guangzhou factory under the bakery division and the expansion of beverage division, the Group increased its number of staff to 24,643. The staffs great effort and valuable contribution have helped the Group s business to grow quickly, providing a solid foundation for the Group s long-term business in the PRC as well as a good return to shareholders. I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone for their hard work during the year.
