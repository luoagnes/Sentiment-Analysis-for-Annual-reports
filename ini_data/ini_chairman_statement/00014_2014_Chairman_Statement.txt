Chairman s Statement Year in Review Hong Kong s economy saw moderate growth in 2013. Its retail leasing market continued to benefit from resilient local and tourist consumption. Grade A office leasing market remained stable due to limited supply largely offsetting weak demand. Rental levels in core areas, including Causeway Bay, were also stable.

The Group s 2013 turnover was HK$3,063 million (2012: HK$2,486 million), representing a year-on-year increase of 23.2% with Hysan Place s first full year contribution. 11.4% growth was recorded in the rest of the portfolio. Occupancy of retail, office and residential sectors at year-end 2013 stood at 95%, 87% and 82% respectively. If excluding Sunning Plaza and Sunning Court being vacated for a combined redevelopment project, the occupancy rates would be 96%, 98% and 92% respectively.
Recurring Underlying Profit, the key measurement of our core leasing business performance, was up 26.0% to HK$2,043 million (2012: HK$1,622 million). This again reflected Hysan Place s contribution and the increase in revenue generated from our retail and office leasing activities. Our Underlying Profit, which excludes unrealised changes in fair value of investment properties, was also HK$2,043 million (2012: HK$1,622 million).
Strong performance in these two profit indicators primarily reflected the improvement in gross profit generated from our core leasing activities, as the Group normalised the property expenses at HK$405 million (2012: HK$423 million) for 2013 and the expense ratio at 13.2% (2012: 17.0%) of turnover for 2013 after the opening of Hysan Place.
Basic earnings per share based on Recurring Underlying Profit correspondingly rose to HK192.10 cents (2012: HK152.83 cents), up 25.7%.
Our Reported Profit for 2013 was HK$6,158 million (2012: HK$9,955 million), principally due to a smaller fair value gain on the Group s investment properties valuation recorded this year. Fair value gain recorded in 2012 also reflected a higher valuation for Hysan Place after construction completion. At year-end 2013, the external valuation of the Group s investment property portfolio increased by 8.8% to HK$65,322 million (2012: HK$60,022 million), reflecting improved rentals for our portfolio. Shareholder s Fund increased by 9.0% to HK$63,326 million (2012: HK$58,123 million).
Our financial position remains strong, with net interest coverage of 15.4 times (2012: 16.8 times) and net debt to equity ratio of 5.3% (2012: 6.2%). Moody s upgraded the Group s credit rating from Baa1 to A3 in May 2013 to reflect the stable recurring income of the Group. Standard and Poor s rating of the Group is BBB+.

The Board of Directors (the Board ) declares a second interim dividend of HK95 cents per share (2012: HK78 cents). Together with the first interim dividend of HK22 cents per share (2012: HK17 cents), there is an aggregate distribution of HK117 cents per share, representing a year-on-year increase of 23.2%. The dividend will be payable in cash.
Lee Gardens: The Premier District for Retail and Offices During the year under review, Hysan continues to define Lee Gardens district as the premium core of Causeway Bay, and indeed, of Hong Kong. With top-class facilities for retailers and other businesses, Lee Gardens in Causeway Bay continues to strengthen its position as a unique work, lifestyle and shopping destination. During 2013, we have enhanced and energised our different hubs within the district: The Lee Theatre hub, our western gateway, is positioned to carry a more urban lifestyle edge. The completion of Lee Theatre Plaza s refurbishment in 2013, with new lower zone flagship stores, created the desired tenant mix and the result was reflected in the mall s financial returns, as well as marked improvement in its visitors traffic.
Turning to the northern part of our portfolio, Hysan Place has secured a reputation as Hong Kong s major retail attraction in its first year of operation. It won the Urban Land Institute s Global Awards for Excellence, as well as International Shopping Center Awards Asia Pacific New Development Gold Award in recognition of its design and development.
The office portion of this iconic building, now also well-known for its top sustainability credentials, has attracted major international businesses, and was fully occupied by the end of the year in review.
The Lee Gardens hub completes the district with its luxury premium retail space, as well as prestigious Grade A office. Within this hub, the combined development of Sunning Plaza and Sunning Court is progressing well and the mixed-use office and retail redevelopment project is on schedule for its anticipated completion by 2018. We continue to carry out renovations at parts of Lee Gardens Two, to be completed in 2014, further enhancing the shopping and dining experience there.
We have further sharpened the brand identity of to emphasize our district s uniqueness. Strong visual connectivity clearly defines the area for visitors to the district.
A great array of events and activities took place within Lee Gardens district also in the past year to highlight the district s dynamism and reinforce its identity. These culminated in the much celebrated heritage exhibition, Lee Gardens On Stage since 1923 , towards the end of 2013, commemorating Lee Gardens development in the past 90 years.
While we continue to refine Lee Gardens as the must-visit district, we steadfastly remain committed to being the premier property company that is superior to its peers in its market of choice, as clearly stated in our corporate vision. In everything we do, we will remain proactive, driven, progressive and strategic, while maintaining our core values of integrity, professionalism and being a responsible business.

We take pride in being a responsible business, and we strive to minimise our environmental impact on the community. Our efforts were well recognised both locally and internationally.
Among the recognitions was the aforementioned Urban Land Institute s Global Awards for Excellence bestowed upon Hysan Place. The project was one of only 12 developments in the world to receive the award in 2013. We are most proud to be honoured by what is widely known as the property development industry s most prestigious awards programme, which recognises superior development efforts based on good design, leadership, contribution to the community, innovations, publicprivate partnerships, environmental protections and enhancement, response to societal needs, and financial success. To this end, Hysan Place also won International Shopping Center Award s Asia Pacific Sustainable 
We will, of course, not rest on our laurels. We will continue to strive to care for the environment and our community who experience, visit, shop, work, not just in one building, but in the Lee Gardens district in general.
For our contributions throughout the past year, please refer to our Corporate Responsibility Report 2013 for more information.

Hong Kong s economy is likely to continue to see moderate growth during 2014. Improving global economy and resilient local private consumption should benefit our balanced retail and office portfolio. We have in place an asset enhancement programme for our property portfolio. We strive to balance and provide steady capital and revenue growth by underpinning our large projects of longer durations, such as the combined Sunning site redevelopment, with other asset enhancement projects that produce more immediate returns. For 2014, we expect our overall performance to be steady.

I would like to thank our management team and our staff for their hard work throughout the year to achieve the set of successful results. I would also like to thank my fellow directors for their commitment and contribution, and look forward to working with everyone in 2014 to accomplish even more.
