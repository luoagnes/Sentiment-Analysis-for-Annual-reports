Our strong commitment and stringent execution in FY2016 were rewarded, beyond expectations, by superior growth and decent margins. Under the backdrop of global political and economic unrest, we ve delivered a strong 8.9% sales growth fueled by omni- channel strategy. Part of the growth is also attributable to our capability to innovate and enrich product offerings, as well as to the outperforming emerging brands. Melvita and L Occitane au Brsil contributed marvelous growth in France, Japan, and Brazil. The inauguration of our Erborian boutique in Taiwan in April 2016 gained lasting traction, following the openings in France, Russia and Korea earlier during the year.

With the continuous passion in quality skin care products in the finest natural ingredients and curiosity to the secret of natural beauty, our strong new product pipelines from Reine Blanche, Shea Face, Cdrat, Divine to limited collection such as Pierre Herm cross-over, one by one excited our loyal customers, penetrated to new users, and revolutionized the natural, premium beauty market. Reine Blanche was again in-house developed by our state-of-the-art laboratory, featuring a whitening solution to illuminate skin in the gentlest way with organic Reine des Prs that sourced from south of France. We shall continue to attract good followings in the coming quarters with superior additions to our signature Divine collection- Harmonie Divine, as well as the sexy new perfume line - Terre de Lumiere.
Our most valuable assets and persistent core values under this ever-changing world are entrepreneurship and cohesive team.

With the eagerness to explore and unveil our growth potential, we ve formulated a secret recipe for innovative marketing campaigns under this new digital era. After skin care

We are pleased to see the migration and integration of our online platform and CRM system in Japan achieved great progress, which will facilitate a stronger long term growth there.

The success of our omni-channel strategy is well endorsed by outperforming E-commerce business and good store traffic backed by new interest and loyal clientele.
Within the context of the growth of our Group, respect for environment, community and human capital is equally important as business. The ongoing engagement with all of our stakeholders enriched our core value while embracing great initiatives. From product development, production to sales and distribution, all of our activities are covered by ISO 14001-certified management system, which endorsed our efforts to decrease environmental impact. I am proud to see that our Union for Vision programme to unite employees for eye care charity activities reached an impressive results: two million people have received eye care.
