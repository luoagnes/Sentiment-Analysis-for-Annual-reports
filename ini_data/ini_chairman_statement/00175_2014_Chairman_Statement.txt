China s passenger vehicle market was stronger than expected in 2013, mainly led by better demand for sedans and Sport Utility Vehicles ( SUVs ). Although the sales of indigenous brand vehicles had recovered since early 2012, its growth continued to lag behind the foreign joint venture brands. The sales volume of indigenous brand vehicles grew 11.4% in 2013, compared with the 15.7% growth of the overall China market.

Despite the implementation of a series of major structural changes in the Group s product development and sales and marketing functions in mid-2013 and the lack of new products in 2013, the Group managed to benefit from the recovery of the demand for passenger vehicles in China and achieved 13% growth in domestic sales volume in 2013.
The performance of the Group s export sales, however, was below our expectations, due to political instability in some of our major export markets and the weakening of emerging market currencies against both US$ and RMB. Despite this, the Group s sales performance in most of our export markets had been better than our competitors, enabling us to achieve higher market shares in most of our major export markets in 2013, reflecting the improved competitiveness of our products. The Group s exports sales volume achieved a respectful 17% growth in 2013, boosting our total sales volume growth to 14% in 2013, compared to our original target of 16% growth and the 15% overall sales volume growth we achieved in 2012.

GEELY AUTOMOBILE HOLDINGS LIMITED Annual Report 2013 
The Group sold a total of 549,468 units of vehicles in 2013, up 14% from 2012, of which 22% or 118,871 units were sold abroad, up 17% from last year. In the Chinese market, the Group s sales volume in 2013 was up 13% to 430,597 units helped by the stronger demand for passenger vehicles in China. EC7 and our SUV models like GX7 and SX7 remained the major contributors to the Group s sales volume growth in 2013.

Although the Group s sales volume growth in 2013 was barely in line with our original target, our financial performance in 2013 beat our expectations with total revenue increased by 17% to RMB28.7 billion for the year ended 31 December 2013, helped by the continued improvement in our product mix and therefore better margins. This was despite faster growth in administrative expenses due to additional expenses incurred by corporate restructuring and higher research and development ( R&D ) investments. The Group s product mix continued to improve in 2013. Our flagship mid-size sedan model EC7 remained the Group s most popular model in terms of sales volume, accounting for 35% of the Group s total sales volume in 2013. Total net profit of the Group was up 31% from RMB2.05 billion in 2012 to RMB2.68 billion in 2013. After accounting for non-controlling interests, net profit attributable to shareholders of the Company was up 31% from RMB2.04 billion in 2012 to RMB2.66 billion in 2013. Diluted earnings per share was up 15% to RMB30.42 cents. The strong operational cash flow during the year and the conversion of all the outstanding convertible bonds in October 2013 further strengthened our financial position with net cash increasing 164% to RMB4.6 billion at the end of 2013.

The Board recommends the payment of a final dividend of HK$4.6 cents per share for 2013 (2012: HK$3.9 cents).

Chairman s Statement 
GEELY AUTOMOBILE HOLDINGS LIMITED Annual Report 2013 
Despite increasing challenges and fierce competition in both our domestic and export markets, we have significantly progressed the restructuring of our product development and sales and marketing functions, aiming at further enhancing the quality of our products and services and improving the efficiency of our sales and distribution capabilities. I have no doubt that the successful execution of these changes should bring about a much stronger Geely in the near future.

The technological cooperation between the Group and Volvo Car Corporation ( Volvo Car ), which is majority owned by the Group s parent Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Limited ( Geely Holding ), has achieved significant progress during the year, enabling the Group to further optimizing resource utilization, and speeding up the implementation of platform strategy, standardization, and shared modularization in product development, and thereby giving the Group a strong and unique advantage over its competitors. I am confident that the synergy benefits for both companies could become increasingly obvious in the coming years, thus boding well for the Group s competitive strength in the areas of technology, quality and brands.

Although consumers in China have become increasingly demanding, thus putting tremendous pressure on automobile manufacturers to raise quality and improve customer satisfaction, there has been an interesting change in their mentality and consumption behavior recently, signaling a shift from excessive and brand-driven consumption to low- key and rational consumption. The Chinese car buyers are now putting more focus on the contents, performance, specifications, environmental impact, energy efficiencies and safety of the vehicles they plan to purchase, I believe the trend could offer huge opportunities for the Group s products in the future.

I firmly believe that the Group is well positioned to achieve its long-term target of becoming a leading international automobile group with good reputation and integrity, winning respects from its customers. Finally, I would like to pay tribute to all our staff for their hard work and achievements during 2013 and to our shareholders for their support.
