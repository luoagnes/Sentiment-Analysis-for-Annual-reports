BUSINESS REVIEW AND OUTLOOK Vitamin C Series The output of vitamin C for the year amounted to 18,434 tonnes, an increase of 30% over last year. Following the completion of the capacity expansion of some PRC manufacturers, prices of vitamin C declined from the exceptionally high level in 2003. The average price of vitamin C for the year was US$4.3 per kg, a decrease of 27% as compared with US$5.9 kg in 2003. The gross profit margin of the entire series decreased from 60.2% in 2003 to 41.8% in current year.
With the completion of the Group s new production line in June 2004, our total production capacity has reached 30,000 tonnes per annum. Following the expansion of capacity, we are now devoting all our efforts to expand our domestic and overseas market shares and produce more downstream products.

The output of penicillin for the year amounted to 4,889 tonnes, a decrease of 7% over last year. Owing to the intensive market competition, prices remained low. The average prices of penicillin industrial salt and amoxicillin for the year were US$9.05 and US$20.76 per kg respectively. The gross profit margin of the entire series decreased from 32.6% in 2003 to 15.9% in current year. However, following the reduction in production volume and closure of production lines of some PRC manufacturers, product prices have rebounded slightly in the fourth quarter of 
The Company s new production lines in Inner Mongolia are close to completion and are expected to put into full production in the second quarter of 2005. With the competitive edge in low production cost, we will be in a stronger position to expand our market share and improve the profit margin.

The output of 7-ACA for the year reached 819 tonnes, an increase of 26% over last year. The 7-ACA market was relatively stable in 2004 and the average price was US$85.13 per kg, slightly higher than last year s. Affected by the rise in production cost, the gross profit margin of the entire series decreased from 22.6% in 2003 to current year s 17.8%.

In 2005, we will strive to improve the production efficiency of 7-ACA in order to increase the production volume and reduce the cost.

Owing to the intensive market competition and the tightened government control over the use of antibiotics, various finished drug products witnessed a decrease in prices, thereby bringing down the gross profit margin of this line of business from 29.3% in 2003 to 23.0% in current year. Notwithstanding the unfavourable market conditions, the Group managed to expand our market share and the turnover increased 21% to HK$947.8 million in current year.
With the capacity expansion of the bulk drugs and the increase in downstream products, the Group will strive to increase our market share in the finished drug market and increase the profit contribution.
