In October 2012, the CKI-led consortium completed the acquisition of Wales & West Utilities. The two months of performance reported by this business since the completion was satisfactory and in line with CKI s acquisition model. However, due to a non-cash mark-to-market impact on derivative instruments arising from the inherited financing structure, CKI reported an accounting loss of HK$117 million for Wales & West Utilities.
Power Assets Achieved Good results Profit contribution from CKI s 38.87% stake in the listed Power Assets was HK$3,757 million, an increase of 7% over 2011 s HK$3,503 million.

steady contribution from Australian Investments The profit contribution from the Group s Australian portfolio was HK$1,146 million as compared to last year s HK$1,306 million.

EnviroWaste is a diversified, vertically integrated waste management business with national coverage across New Zealand. Completion is expected to take place in the second quarter of 2013. This acquisition marks CKI s expansion into the business of dedicated waste management infrastructure.

Since the Group s inception, we have adopted an effective set of strategies for continued growth: (1) Growing existing businesses organically; (2) Acquiring new businesses with good and stable returns; and (3) Maintaining a solid balance sheet.

CKI has achieved another strong performance in 2012. Over the past few years, we have stepped up the pace of our acquisition strategy and benefitted from the opportunities presented in the uncertain global economic environment.
Our earnings base has been expanded and profitability enhanced. Good organic growth has also been achieved.
At the same time, prudent corporate finance initiatives have been undertaken to strengthen our balance sheet.

Looking ahead, we will continue to adhere to our three-pronged strategy to deliver growth to our shareholders.
Though the economic climate going into 2013 remains uncertain, CKI is well-positioned to weather such conditions and to capitalise on any opportunities which may arise.

To conclude, I would like to thank the Board, management and staff for their continued efforts, as well as our shareholders for their support and trust.
