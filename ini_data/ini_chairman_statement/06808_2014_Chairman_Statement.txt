CHAIRMAN S STATEMENT 
I am very pleased to report to you the substantial progress made in 2013 by Sun Art Retail Group Limited (the Company , together with its subsidiaries, the Group ), posting again good results in a challenging year.
We have been able to continue to improve our bottom line reaching a profit after tax of RMB2,942 million while opening a record number of 50 new stores, and gaining market share again in a purely organic way, which we believe is the most profitable way of developing our business.
As a consequence, and because we have the means to fund our development plans, the Board has recommended the payment of final dividend of HKD2,671 million, translating into HKD0.28 per share. This does not mean our long standing policy of a dividend of around 30% of profit after tax announced during our IPO will change in the years to come.
In 2013, our Board has (as I mentioned in our 2012 annual report) run its first strategic meeting, and engaged with our management team in a discussion on how to continue to grow at a sustained rate, and face the competitive challenges coming from all retail formats in China s retail market. It has in particular given the go-ahead to the development and opening of www.feiniu.com, which is able to deliver around 100,000 items to our customers in the Greater Shanghai region within one year after our decision.
We hope our continuous emphasis on understanding changing customer behaviors and needs, sustained investment in new systems and employee development, will help us to keep our competitive position and deliver value to our shareholders.
