Chairman s Statement 
I report the activities of the Company and its subsidiaries (together the Group ) for the year ended 31 December 2011.

Sales of the Group s highly purified silicon has increased 18.0% year on year in 2011. The Group is now focusing on stabilising the output of the highly purified silicon products. Despite the increase in sales volume, prices are still subject to the risks of short term fluctuation that are affected by the market supply and demand.
The mineral resources and steel metal trading arm contributed HK$1,698 million revenue to the Group in its first year s full operation, which provided steady cashflow and good return to the Group.
Since entering into a share purchase agreement on 5 March 2010 with an independent third party Grupo Votorantim s wholly owned subsidiary Votorantim Novos Negcios Ltda. ( VNN ) to acquire 100% interest of a company having rich iron mineral resources in Brazil Sul Americana de Metais S.A. ( SAM ), the Group has made substantial progress towards the completion of the acquisitions. Resources have been confirmed. Benefication tests, environmental evaluation, preliminary engineering design are moving on schedule.
The directors believe that the acquisitions of SAM will make the business strategy and scope of the Company more focused. Our resources and energy sector (including mining and the iron ore project) is becoming the Group s principal 
The Company has disposed of the business associated with magazine publishing and advertising activities in the first quarter of 2011. The disposal will enable the Group to focus on the resources and energy sector with better growth potential, and enables the Group to have a clearer business strategy.

On behalf of the Board, I would like to take this opportunity to thank our shareholders, customers and cooperative partners for their continued support during 2011 and all staff for their hard work.
