MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
During the year ended 31 December 2015, the domestic and global markets remained challenging and the economic environment was complicated. The China manufacturing PMI index has been in economic contraction (below 50) since March 2015. China s economic growth continues to experience downward pressure. The GDP growth rate moderated to 6.9% for 2015, the slowest growth rate in previous 25 years. Globally, the capital outflow triggered by the end of quantitative easing and the raise of interest rate of US as well as the sharp decline of commodity price of bulk materials resulted in the significant depreciation of currencies in various emerging economies. These have shrunk our overseas customer s purchasing power and affected the business confidence in global trade environment. All of these have created a very tough market environment for our customers and us, and the market sentiment has further deteriorated since August 2015.
Amidst these market challenges, we leveraged on our early adoption of a business development strategy of shifting small tonnage hydraulic PIMMs to full-electric PIMMs and from large tonnage to two-plate PIMMs. Our sales continue to deliver solid performance and outperform industry peers. The sales of our Zhafir Venus Series (full-electric PIMMs) and our Jupiter Series (large two-plate PIMMs) increased to RMB675.7 million and RMB741.3 million in 2015, representing an increase of 29.5% and 39.8% respectively compared to 2014. In 2015, the sales mix of full-electric PIMMs in small tonnage PIMMs and that of two-plate PIMMs in medium- to-large tonnage PIMMs reached 14.8% (2014: 11.1%) and 28.5% (2014: 19.5%) respectively. The strong growth of full-electric and two-plate PIMMs are able to substantially offset the general weak demand of PIMMs industry and maintain our sales at similar scale in current adverse environment. We recorded revenue of RMB7,336.4 million in 2015, representing a decrease of only 3.0% compared to the record revenue of RMB7,560.3 million in 2014.
At the same time, we continue to enhance our operational efficiencies and productivity through streamlining manufacturing process and up-grading IT system and manufacturing capabilities. As a result, we continued to make a satisfactory progress in operational efficiency and profitability. In 2015, our gross margin increased to 33.0% from 32.4% in 2014. The rise of gross margin was attributable to i) improvement in operational efficiency and ii) lower steel related raw material costs. As a result of the improved gross margin, our operating profit increased from RMB1,485.9 million in 2014 to RMB1,545.5 million in 2015, representing an increase of 4.0%.
Our net profit attributable to shareholders of the Company in 2015 increased to RMB1,363.3 million, representing an increase of 4.5% compared to 2014. Excluding the issuing expense of CB in 2014 and non-cash accounting loss of change in fair value of CB resulted from bond value changes (excluding exchange loss of CB), the adjusted net profit attributable to shareholders of the Company in 2015 would be RMB1,333.0 million, representing an increase of 0.1% compared to 2014.

The Board of Directors has declared a second interim dividend of HK$0.19 per share for the year ended 31 December 2015 (2014: HK$0.18), bringing the total dividend for 2015 to HK$0.35 per share (2014: HK$0.34).
Domestic and export sales Domestic and export sales of the Group by geographic areas are summarized in the following table: (RMB million) 2015 % 2014 % 
Domestic Sales 4,869.2 66.4% 5,071.1 67.1% (4.0%) Export Sales 2,293.0 31.3% 2,331.4 30.8% (1.6%) Parts 174.2 2.3% 157.8 2.1% 10.4% Total 7,336.4 100% 7,560.3 100.0% (3.0%) The domestic demand of PIMMs remained sluggish in 2015. The investment sentiment and expansion plan in domestic markets were further adversely affected by several unexpected market changes including A shares market crash and sharp depreciation of RMB in the second half of 2015. We observed certain domestic peers recorded more than double-digit drop in sales figures in 2015. Benefiting from well market acceptance of our full-electric PIMMs and two-plate PIMMs as well as the brand reputation of the Company, our domestic sales outperformed the industry peers and recorded only a mild drop of 4.0% to RMB4,869.2 million in 2015 and further reinforced our leading market position in China.
For our export, certain traditional strong markets like Brazil, Turkey and Russia experienced pressures from the continuous depreciation of currencies and political instabilities which adversely affect the CAPEX in these markets. In face of such complicated environments, our diversified market advantages allowed us to mitigate some of these impacts. Despite the unfavorable export environment in general, the results of the export of the Company were encouraging and performed well through strengthening the sales network and enhancing the pre-sales and after-sales services. New service projects such as setting up newly established overseas Service, Application and Test Centers at locations including Thailand, Indonesia and Mexico can provide target customers with a package of solutions promptly. Certain overseas markets such as Vietnam, Korea, India, Europe and Mexico recorded impressive growth after years of efforts invested in these markets. We recorded our export sales at RMB2,293.0 million in 2015, representing a minor drop of 1.6% compared to 2014.

Small and medium-to-large tonnage sales The Group s sales by small tonnage and medium-to-large tonnage plastic injection moulding machines are summarized in the 
(RMB million) 2015 % 2014 % 
Small tonnage 4,562.7 62.2% 4,687.7 62.0% (2.7%) Medium-to-large tonnage 2,599.5 35.4% 2,714.8 35.9% (4.2%) Parts 174.2 2.4% 157.8 2.1% 10.4% Total 7,336.4 100% 7,560.3 100% (3.0%) Due to the tough market environment mentioned above, the sales of small tonnage and medium to large PIMMs decreased to RMB4,562.7 million and RMB2,599.5 million in 2015, representing a decrease of 2.7% and 4.2% respectively compared to 2014.
Sales mix of PIMMs by product series The Group s sales by product series machines are summarized in the following table: (RMB million) 2015 % 2014 % 
Mars series (energy-saving features PIMMs) 5,086.1 69.3% 5,726.7 75.7% (11.2%) Venus series (full-electric PIMMs) 675.7 9.2% 521.6 6.9% 29.5% Jupiter series (two-plate PIMMs) 741.3 10.1% 530.3 7.0% 39.8% Others Series 659.1 9.0% 623.9 8.3% 5.6% Parts 174.2 2.4% 157.8 2.1% 10.4% Total 7,336.4 100% 7,560.3 100% (3.0%) Amid the domestic and global challenging environment, the overall demand of PIMMs decreased in 2015. Therefore, the sales of our energy-saving Mars series, which is designed for most of plastic components production, decreased from RMB5,726.7 million in 2014 to RMB5,086.1 million in 2015, representing a drop of 11.2%. However, by continuous improvement and the success of the introduction of the second generation, the Mars series remained the best selling series representing nearly 70% of the total sales.
We expect that Mars series will continue to be the major series to meet the needs of most plastic component production and will pick up once the overall PIMM market recovers. We also set our strategies in the continuation of shifting small tonnage hydraulic PIMMs to full-electric PIMMs and large tonnage to two-plate PIMMs. Our Venus full-electric PIMMs are specifically designed for increasing demand of complex and precise as well as complicated thin-wall plastic components. The sales of our Zhafir Venus Series (full-electric PIMMs) increased to RMB675.7 million in 2015, representing an increase of 29.5%, while its sales mix in small tonnage PIMMs reached 14.8% (2014: 11.1%). Our Jupiter series two-plate large PIMMs, which have the advantages of space saving and efficiency enhancement, increased its sales to RMB741.3 million in 2015, representing an increase of 39.8% compared to 2014, while its sales mix in medium-to-large tonnage PIMMs reached 28.5% (2014: 19.5%).
Our efforts in R&D and new product innovation as well as in communication are well reflected in our Haitian brand. In the 2015 China Brand Evaluation List conducted by CCTV together with China National Institute of Standardization, China Association for Brand Construction Promotion, China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and China Appraisal Society, our Haitian Brand achieved a brand value of RMB6.14 billion and brand strength of 844, ranking the third in Chinese machinery manufacturing industry list, up from the fourth in 2014. We believed our long term committed efforts in R&D, innovation in management, technology and services enable us to continuously improve our worldwide image from Made in China to Created in China, from Chinese efficiency only to Chinese efficiency and quality and from just Chinese products to be recognized as a worldwide Chinese 
Looking ahead, the operating environment will remain challenging under the existing macro-factors of slowing China s economy growth, volatility of currency exchange rate caused by expected gradual increase of US interest rate and continuous drop in bulk commodity prices, which weakened business confidence. In short term, we do not expect the demand of PIMMs and investment sentiment will have dramatic improvement nor significant deteroiation.
We have full confidence in the soundness of our long-term business strategy and the future of its market environment. Under the Chinese new economic normal era of shifting to product quality and sustainable growth, there are opportunities as well as challenges for developments in our industry. We believe in plastics applications as basic necessities and their consumption will keep increasing no matter how the global or Chinese economy perform. The change in the economic climates of different regions will only result in inter-shifting of plastic production bases among regions. One of our long term strategies is to enhance our pre-sales and aftersales service network by setting up overseas service centers and expanding overseas assembly bases and to gradually provide customers with services including test and application centers and whole set of solutions for their production. This will support the customers expansion of plastic production facilities all over the world. Being the largest PIMM exporter in China, we are in absolute prime position to capture the business opportunities of increasing plastic production expanding to other regions resulted from shifting of production bases to relative lower cost countries or continuous outbound investment by Chinese enterprises. The gradual development of Chinese economy to domestic consumption-driven model will make the role of Chinese domestic market not only as a world plastic factory but also a major plastic consumer, which will boost the continuous increase in plastic consumption per capita 
In the 13th Five-Year Plan, Chinese government has launched various new strategies, including Made in China 2025 and Internet Plus . Made in China 2025 and Internet Plus will drive technological upgrades and application of mid to high end PIMMs.
PIMMs will offer energy saving features, high operational efficiency, the flexibility of industrial and information integration and 
In order to capitalize on the future trend of the manufacturing industry, we enhanced our proven service-oriented sales model by an application-oriented sales model . Such enhancement represents our change from being solely a supplier of individual units of equipment to a supplier of a complete set of equipment providing customers with overall solutions for their production. Therefore, we have also built up a professional team for the supporting and offering of intelligent manufacturing business so as to align with the change in market strategies from the sales model of service-oriented to application-oriented , resulting in providing the customers with complete set of integrated solutions to production process automation.
At the same time, we will comprehensively launch upgraded machines of Plus series second generation of all models in 2016 accompany with the strategies in shifting small tonnage hydraulic PIMMs to full-electric PIMMs and from large tonnage to two-plate PIMMs. We will take this opportunity to expand the market share and to lay the foundation of enhancing market presence in the 
2016 is an important milestone in the history of Haitian, marking the 50th anniversary of our Group since our founding in 1966. Over the past five decades, we developed from an individual workshop to one of the largest and most profitable PIMM manufacturers in the world. This success was built upon the basis of our committed customer-oriented R&D efforts, uncompromised product and service quality, extensive distribution network, efficient and flexible production capabilities and strong financial positions with innovation in technology, management and services. We believe that, in the long run, with the economic reform made by Chinese government, Chinese economy will be on a more balanced and sustainable development path. We have experienced different crisis and structural changes of the Chinese economy and we will continue to navigate through the existing adverse environment and capture business opportunities again so as to grow stronger, and to achieve satisfactory results for our employees, customers, business partners and shareholders.
