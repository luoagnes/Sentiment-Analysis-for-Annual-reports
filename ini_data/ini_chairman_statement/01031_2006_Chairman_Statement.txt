CHAIRMAN S STATEMENT 
Golden Resorts Group achieved excellent results in 2005. For the year ended 31 December 2005, the Group s turnover was approximately HK$372 million, representing a significant increase of 163% as compared with HK$141 million last year. The increase was mainly due to revenue generated from the Grandview Hotel and Casa Real Hotel in Macau which were both acquired in 2005. The Group s loss attributable to shareholders was approximately HK$293 million for the year (2004: HK$11 million), and loss per share for the year was HK 25.58 cents (2004: HK 1.42 cents).
The loss was mainly due to a share-based payment expense of approximately HK$496.8 million charged to the income statement in accordance with the newly implemented HKFRS 2 issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, which came into effect and was adopted by the Group for the first time in 2005. This expense was a one-time non-cash extra-ordinary accounting treatment to the books of the Company. The details of this expense are disclosed in Note 7 to the financial statements.
A net profit of HK$204 million was recorded if this accounting treatment was not taken up in the books of the Group.

The Board of Directors has resolved not to recommend any dividend for the financial year ended 31 December 2005 (2004: Nil).

2005 BUSINESS OVERVIEW 2005 proved to be an exciting year for the overall Macau tourist and gaming industry. Annual visitor arrivals reached a new high of 18.7 million, a 12.3% increase over 2004. Gross gaming revenues reached approximately HK$45.8 billion, only a fraction less than the Las Vegas Strip. The opening of new tourist destinations directly benefited our hotels, bringing more visitors into our mass market gaming halls. The evolution of Macau into a world class destination is truly taking off.
Last year was a transformational year for Golden Resorts Group. In March, the Company was officially renamed as Golden Resorts Group Limited and in the same month the Group acquired Grandview Hotel. In May, the Group acquired the Casa Real Hotel. After the completion of the acquisitions, both casino hotels have undergone a series of strategic renovations which increased capacity and visitor traffic in the casino areas. Golden Resorts Group has not only successfully entered the Macau gaming market but also established a strong foothold with a recognisable brand, providing superior service paired with customer satisfaction.
The exceptional performance in 2005 proved that the decision to transform the core business of Golden Resorts Group into hotel and gaming was 
HOTEL AND GAMING BUSINESS Following the acquisitions of Grandview Hotel and Casa Real Hotel, the Group consolidated the results of these two hotels for the periods starting from the months of April 2005 and June 2005 respectively.

Although hotel and gaming revenues in each hotel contributed only 9 months and 7 months of operational results respectively, for the year ended 31 December 2005, turnover of the two hotels together recorded approximately HK$244 million, representing 65% of the Group s total turnover. Of the hotel and gaming revenues, mass market gaming halls accounted for 52.5% of such turnover, VIP room rental income accounted for 12.4% and revenue from the hotel business contributed 35.1%.
The adjusted operating profit before depreciation; amortisation and interest from the hotel and gaming business was approximately HK$138 million (2004: Nil) after charging an expense of HK$20 million for one-time non-recurring compensations to certain tenants of Grandview Hotel for the early termination of their leases in order to make room for the casino expansion in the hotel. Following the expansion of the gaming facilities at Grandview Hotel and renovation and refurbishment works of the gaming facilities at Casa Real Hotel, a remarkable increase in gaming income was recorded for both hotels thereafter.
MANUFACTURING AND TRADING OF WATCHES AND WATCHES COMPONENTS For the year ended 31 December 2005, turnover of the watch business recorded approximately HK$128 million, representing 35% of the Group s total turnover, and representing a 1.5% increase as compared to approximately HK$126.2 million of last year. Although the sales remain relatively stable, the Group experienced an increase in operation efficiency through tighter inventories and cost control.
