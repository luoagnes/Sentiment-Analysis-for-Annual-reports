Hong Kong Property Investment Rentals from investment properties continued to be one of the major sources of our income. The overall occupancy rate of the Group s retail portfolio was 79.17% as at 31st December, 2006 due to the renovation of Windsor House and Silvercord. The occupancy rate jumped to 92.35% if Windsor House and Silvercord are excluded. Such sustainable high occupancy rate is attributable to the prime locations of the majority of the Group s retail properties. Retail rents were generally raised due to the increase in tenants business turnover benefited from the growth of both tourists and local consumption.
During the Year under review, the gross rental income slightly reduced 6.7% to HK$667.9 million, as compared with last year. The decrease in gross rental income is mainly attributable to the redevelopment of Tung Ying Building and Tung Sang Building; the renovation works of Laforet (formerly Nu Front), Windsor House and Silvercord; and the sale of substantial part of Chic Castle. Such a temporary reduction is believed to be worthwhile as the redevelopment and renovation will maximize the value of the Group s retail properties. If the redeveloped and renovated properties are excluded, gross rental income would be increased by approximately 12.8% over the last year, and the respective increases in retail and non-retail portion have been 16.0% and 7.0%.
