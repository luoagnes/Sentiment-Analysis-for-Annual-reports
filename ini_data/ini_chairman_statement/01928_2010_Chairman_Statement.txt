Chairman s Statement 
Sands China s profit for the year ended December 31, 2009 was US$213.8 million, up from US$175.7 million in 2008, a dramatic increase of 21.7%。On behalf of the Board of Directors ( the Board ) of Sands China, I am pleased to present to you our fi rst Annual Report as a company listed on the Main Board of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited.
Sands China s profi t attributable to shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2009 was US$213.8 million, up from US$175.7 million in 2008, an increase of 21.7%. Earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2009 was US$3.32 cents (HK$25.77 cents), up from US$2.80 cents (HK$21.69 cents) in 2008, an increase of 18.6%.
Adjusted EBITDAR for the year ended December 31, 2009 was US$809.0 million, an increase of US$123.0 million or 17.9% compared to US$686.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.In 2009, Sands China benefited from a number of key
strengths that helped to differentiate our business from that
of our competitors, including the following:
•  We provided the highest quality integrated resort
offerings, which include a diversifi ed set of products
and services, including substantial non-gaming
amenities. That unique product offering enables us to
target and attract a broad range of customers;
•  The diversification of amenities provided us with
a substantially higher adjusted EBITDAR to sales
percentage compared to casino-only operators,
particularly at the high end of the market. This
diversifi cation enabled us to lead the market, by far, in
adjusted EBITDAR generation;
•  We generated substantial cash flow and earnings
from our existing operations;
•  We maintained an industry-leading development
pipeline, including additional integrated resorts
currently under development on Cotai;
•  We utilized established brands with broad regional
and international appeal to market to potential
customers;
•  We operated very effi ciently to control our overall cost
structure;
•  We maintained an experienced management team
with a proven track record in both operations and
development; and
•  We derived significant benefits from our on-going
relationship with Las Vegas Sands Corp.
These business strategies resulted in strong financial
and operating performance for our Group in 2009. The
Venetian Macao welcomed 23.8 million visitors during
2009 and generated US$554.8 million (HK$4,302.3 million)
in adjusted EBITDAR, an increase of 11.6% compared to
the US$497.2 million (HK$3,853.5 million) in 2008. The
Sands Macao welcomed 6.9 million visitors and generated
US$243.4 million (HK$1,887.5 million) in adjusted EBITDAR
in 2009, an increase of 13.5% compared to the US$214.4
million (HK$1,661.7 million) generated in 2008. In its fi rst
full calendar year of operation, the Four Seasons Hotel and
Plaza Casino welcomed 4.5 million visitors and generated
US$40.3 million (HK$312.5 million) in adjusted EBITDAR.
The introduction during the year of our Paiza Mansions,
luxurious accommodations of 3,500–17,000 square feet,
contributed to a signifi cant increase in adjusted EBITDAR at
this property in the latter half of the year.
Prospects
Our cost savings and efficiency programs remained an
important component of our operating strategy throughout
2009, and I am pleased to report that we were successful in
implementing all of our identifi ed cost savings initiatives by
December 31, 2009. I believe that these initiatives will allow
us to expand our adjusted EBITDAR margins in the future
and will provide enhanced operating leverage in the months
and years ahead.
We hosted 15 trade shows in 2009, which attracted more
than 320,000 visitors to Macao and Cotai. In addition, we
hosted 388 corporate groups, which brought an additional
60,000 delegates to Macao. Given current trade show and
group booking trends, we are confi dent of strong growth in
MICE visitation in 2010.
We substantially completed the construction of our Four
Seasons-branded Apart-Hotel Tower in the fourth quarter
of 2009. We feel that market conditions in Macao are
favorable for the execution of our strategy and expect to
begin to monetize this important asset in 2010.
In November 2009, the Macao Government awarded a
concession by lease for Parcels 5 and 6. We are now waiting
for publication of the land concession in the offi cial gazette.
After receiving commitments of US$1.75 billion of project
financing in November 2009 (which we expect to close
in April 2010), we were able to mobilize to recommence
the construction of Parcels 5 and 6 of our Cotai Strip
developments. We also expect to get into high levels of
actual construction starting in April. We expect that it will
take approximately 16 months to complete construction of
Phase I, which will include 3,700 rooms from the Shangri-
La, Traders and Sheraton hotel brands, and an additional
six months to complete the adjacent 2,300 room Sheraton
Tower hotel in Phase II.
The Macao Government granted us an extension of the
development deadline under the land concession for Parcel
3 on Cotai on September 29, 2009. Under the terms of the
land concession, we must now complete development of
Parcel 3 by April 17, 2013.
Our CotaiJet TM ferry operation was issued a new 10-year
license on January 14, 2010. The new license not only
permits us to continue operating ferries between Macao
and Hong Kong, but also permits us to offer additional
routes to Macao from Hong Kong, including from the China
Ferry Terminal in Kowloon and the Hong Kong International
Airport. Opening these new routes and increasing capacity
from Hong Kong to Macao will facilitate the growth of our
MICE business by seamlessly linking Hong Kong to Cotai.
The process of becoming a listed company in Hong
Kong was completed during the year, and provides the
opportunity for Asian investors to participate in our
future success through the ownership of shares in Sands
China. Our business strategy is to continue to successfully
execute our Cotai Strip developments and to leverage our
integrated resort business model to create Asia’s premier
gaming, leisure and convention destination. Our business
strategies and development plans allow us to achieve strong
growth and fi nancial performance in the future. We look
forward to reporting to shareholders at the Annual General
Meeting and in the next interim and annual reports on
the effective management of our company’s business and
assets, and upon the continued delivery of value to you and
other stakeholders.
