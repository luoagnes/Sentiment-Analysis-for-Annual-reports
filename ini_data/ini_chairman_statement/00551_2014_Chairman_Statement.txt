In 2012, Yue Yuen Industrial ( H o l d i n g s ) L i m i t e d ( t h e Company and together with its subsidiaries, the Group ) changed its financial year end to 31st December from 30th September. Fiscal 2013 is the first financial year after the change and the audited financial statements for the period covers the year ended 31st December, 2013. The change of the financial year end date means the Company, Pou Sheng International (Holdings) L i m i t e d ( P o u S h e n g ) a n d t h e o p e r a t i n g s u b s i d i a r i e s incorporated in the People s Republic of China (the PRC ), will have contemporaneous fiscal 
D u r i n g t h e y e a r e n d e d 3 1 s t December, 2013, the Group s s a l e s t o i t s c u s t o m e r s w e r e w i t h i n m a n a g e m e n t s expectations. Fiscal 2013 was expected to be somewhat weaker than the same reporting period in 2012 due to the lack of catalysts such as the European Cup and the Olympics. Furthermore, uncertainties continued to affect t h e d i f f e r e n t r e g i o n s i n t h e world. Economic and financial issues regarding the European Union ( EU ) monetary system ( MS ) were beginning to affect some of the leading member countries of the EUMS. In turn t h i s h u r t g e n e r a l c o n s u m e r sentiment within the EU. In the United States (the US ), national spending and the new health care act continued to dominate the discussion within t h e g o v e r n m e n t . I n v a r i o u s instances, the general public had the feeling that the US 
g o v e r n m e n t w o u l d b e c o m e increasingly dysfunctional. Both in Europe and the US, discussions regarding the need for reductions in government expenditures and social benefit payments, as well as approaches to increasing tax revenues, were in the news headlines. The PRC economy continued to be challenged with annual GDP growth occurring at a slower rate, rising consumer prices and the trend of further appreciation of the RMB during the year. Despite the challenging environment, the Group recorded i n c r e a s e i n b o t h f o o t w e a r manufacturing and retail sales.

T h e o p e r a t i n g e n v i r o n m e n t f o r f o o t w e a r m a n u f a c t u r i n g was difficult. Minimum wages a c r o s s t h e d i f f e r e n t A s i a regions continued to increase in accordance with government regulations. Costs were also up on account of efficiency 
issues with respect to newly opened factories and production lines, reallocation of production capacity, and high staff turnover in certain factories. Furthermore, rising government mandated social benefit costs in the PRC, a s w e l l a s g e n e r a l i n f l a t i o n p r e s s u r e s a c r o s s t h e A s i a region, meant that input costs on the whole continue to move upward. Notwithstanding, the management team of footwear m a n u f a c t u r i n g o p e r a t i o n s continued to enhance factory productivity and supply chain efficiency to offset the rising 
For this year, sales growth was achieved by the Group in both footwear manufacturing and retail businesses, as compared to the pro forma twelve months ended 31st December, 2012.
Consolidated turnover of the Group increased by 4.1% to US$7,582.5 million, compared to US$7,280.6 million recorded in pro forma year 2012. When looking at the Group s listed subsidiary Pou Sheng, which is involved in the retail business, brand licensee and manufacturing business, it achieved sales of US$1,777.2 million, an increase of 1.4% compared to that recorded in pro forma year 2012. During the year, the consolidated net profit attributable to equity holders of the Company, decreased by 7.1% to US$434.8 million compared to US$467.9 million earned in pro forma year 2012. For Pou Sheng, the operating environment was still difficult so that it experienced a net loss attributable to equity h o l d e r s o f U S $ 3 8 . 7 m i l l i o n ; however, this was an improvement as compared to pro forma year 2012 net loss of US$77.2 million.

Similar to previous reporting p e r i o d s , A s i a r e g i o n , w h i c h includes both manufacturing and retail activities, represented 42% of the Group s sales. The US market accounted for 29% and Europe 20% of the Group s sales.
The rest of the world accounted for the remaining 9%.

During the year, the Group produced 313.4 million pairs of shoes, representing an increase of 1.1% 
compared to the same period last year. Given the rising costs across Asia, footwear manufacturing activities can take place only if there is adequate planning. To stay ahead of the competition, the management team of the footwear manufacturing business has been seeking to lower the cost structure of the manufacturing bases as well as fine tuning the efficiency of the Group s supply chain processes. In order to simplify and automate the production process further, the Group and the brand name customers have been working closely together to continue to enhance factory productivity and supply chain efficiency.

F o r t h e y e a r , c o n s u m e r spending in the PRC was still weak compared to the earlier years. Rapid expansion in the distribution channels for athletic shoes and apparel across the country in the past few years, combined with the increased s o p h i s t i c a t i o n i n c o n s u m e r tastes, created an extremely competitive environment for the athletic brand owners and their distribution partners. As a result, growth was limited for the 
sales of athletic footwear and apparel. Industrywide inventory levels were still elevated, and aggressive discounting was needed periodically. At the end of the year, the Group had 3,665 directly operated storescounters in the Greater China region and 2,263 sub-distributors in the PRC.
During the year, Pou Sheng s management team concentrated on improving operating efficiency and keeping the store network operating primarily in the 1st and 2nd tier cities. Management believes that less discounting, better inventory management and higher sales yield per unit of floor space, will steadily help the retail business return to profitability. In the longer term, prospects for the retail business remain attractive as the trend of economic growth in the PRC and consumer income are expected to continue to grow

Long term planning is crucial to enable the Group to reach the various sustainable development targets. We believe sustainable development is important in human resource management, industrial process management, and end-to-end supply chain m a n a g e m e n t . F u n d a m e n t a l principles need to be established across all factories to facilitate sustainable development. One set of standards should exist for ethical conducts and values, and an organizational structure must also be created for all factories to follow. Incentives must be established to reward factories that achieve the designated standards. The management

For the three months ended M a r c h 2 0 1 4 , t h e G r o u p s c o n s o l i d a t e d t u r n o v e r h a d increased by 7.4% year-on-year to approximately US$1.8 billion.

M a j o r s p o r t i n g e v e n t s u c h as the World Cup could raise people s interests in sports and hence the demand for sporting goods, including athletic shoes.
Nonetheless, the outlook for global economic environment in 2014 remains unclear at this point. The US economy appears to be on the path of recovery but still has challenges ahead.
The economic outlook for each of the EU member countries also vary greatly. As the PRC government shifts its focus from high economic growth rate to 
market reforms, economic growth is expected to slow compared to that of the earlier years. However, the recent weakening of the RMB in March 2014 could be helpful to partly offset the rising input costs for manufacturers in the PRC involved in exports.

Pou Sheng s management still has many tasks ahead of them, and with greater focus on the retail operations, they should be able to achieve better results in the coming year and beyond.

O n b e h a l f o f t h e b o a r d o f directors, I wish to thank our customers, suppliers, business associates and shareholders for their supports. I would also like to offer special thanks to our staff for their invaluable service and contribution throughout last year.
