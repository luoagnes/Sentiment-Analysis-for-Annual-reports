Chairman’s Statement
Dear Shareholders,
On behalf of the board (“Board”)
of directors of Man Wah Holdings
Limited (“Man Wah”), I am pleased
to present the audited annual results
for the year ended 31 March 2010
(“FY2010” or “Review Period”). FY2010
has been a successful year for the
Company, culminating in the listing
of our Shares on the Main Board of
the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on 9
April 2010. The gross proceeds of HK$
1,681.8 million raised from the IPO
have significantly strengthened our
capacity to grow our business.
FY2010 – A Year of Excellent
Growth
FY2010 has been a phenomenal
year for Man Wah; it has been a
year of substantial growth in all our
businesses.
This growth has resulted from the
relentless implementation of our
strategies, which since 2000, have
enabled our revenue, EBITDA and net
profit to grow tremendously over the
years.
Much of the growth has been
achieved because of our philosophy of
“Partnership” with our customers and
other shareholders We spend much
time and efforts in understanding the
needs of our customers and in finding
ways in which we can anticipate and
meet those needs. This is true in each
of our divisions and at all levels of
our organization.
This “Partnership” philosophy
has seen Man Wah achieving an
outstanding results performance in
FY2010. Our total sales surged to
approximately HK$ 2,932.2 million,
representing an increase of 49.3%
over the previous financial year.
(2009: HK$ 1963.8 million). Profit
for the year grew by 171.0% over
FY2009 to approximately HK$ 605.8
million (2009: HK$ 223.5 million).
Basic earnings per share was HK 85.09
cents, representing an increase of
169.0%. To share the success with our
shareholders (“Shareholders”), the
Board has recommended the payment
of a final dividend and a special
dividend of HK 16 cents and HK 6
cents per Share, respectively. The total
payout dividend for FY2010 will be
approximately HK$ 213.7 million and
the total dividend payout ratio for the
year amounted to approximately 35%.
FY2010 – A Year of Progress
We have seen progress in all our major
markets. During the Review Period,
the Group devoted more resources in
marketing and R&D, and proactively
strengthened the market presence
of our brands. The total number of
CHEERS brand retail stores in China
grew from 265 as at 31 March 2009 to
296 as at 31 March 2010, of which 74
are self-owned and 222 are operated
by distributors.
We also carried out extensive
marketing activities to boost our
CHEERS brand image in US and
Europe, to our corporate customers.
These include our participation in
the Las Vagas Fair and Highpoint
Furnishing Fair in US as well as
the IMM Furniture Fair in Cologne,
Germany. In the second half of
FY2010, Macy’s, a department store in
the US, became our latest customer
to carry CHEERS brand of recliner sofa
in US. To date, the Group has 291
distributors in US.
For our ENLANDA mattress division,
the Group continued to build on its
distribution channel by expanding
its retail stores in China. To date, we
have 43 self-owned ENLANDA stores
and 170 distributor stores spreading
across 20 provinces in China.
FY2010 – A Year to Sharpen
Our Competitive Strength
Man Wah’s culture is built on the
philosophy of “Partnership”, where we
viewed customers and Shareholders as
our long-term partners. As a result, we
focus on the long term sustainability
of the business rather than short
term gains in business volatility. This
has allowed us to create significant
advantages that now support our
growth. These include the followings:
1)  Brands – The Group views
branding as a key element in
growing Man Wah’s business.
We have established CHEERS
as the market leader in PRC’s
reclining sofa sector with
a 16.2% market share. The
management has engaged a
global branding consultancy
firm, Ogilvy & Mather (Hong
Kong) Private Limited, to help
the Group in creating a world-
class PRC brand. To better
promote our brand in China,
we have also retained Mr Sun
Hong Lei, a leading movie
star in PRC, as our brand
spokesman.
In addition, our mattress
division is also committed
in growing our premium
ENLANDA brand in China while
our LAND brand is also gaining
popularity for its wood-based
furniture.
2)  Capacity – With the completion
of our furniture manufacturing
facility in Huizhou in 2007,
our capacity has expanded to
516,000 sofa units per annum
which allows our Company to
expand our export sales and
PRC domestic retail presence.
We have plans to expand the
Huizhou facility’s capacity to
816,000 sofa units per annum
by 2011.
We have also started works
on a 300,000 sofa units
production capacity facility
in Wujiang, Jiangsu Province,
which will help to expand our
marketing reach and to reduce
logistics expenses. We are also
exploring opportunities in the
northern China market.
3)  Distribution Channel –
FY2010 also saw the Group
accelerating its retail
expansion plans in China
to cater to a strong growing
demand for CHEERS and
ENLANDA products in China.
As our CHEERS brand grew stronger
in China, the Group targeted to set
up another 25 flagship stores in
strategic locations across China to
provide our customers with a more
pleasant shopping environment and
to enhance customers’ satisfaction.
FY2011 – A Year of
Opportunity
It is not possible to move on from
FY2010 without reflecting on the
terrible economic besetting Europe,
raising the prospects of another
global recession. While this episode
has brought out the doomsayers
in full force, the Group tends to
think positively and evaluate the
opportunities that lie ahead of us.
The Group’s management believes
that many of the factors that have
allowed the Group to grow successfully
in the past will continue to persist
in FY2011. We plan to continue to
follow on our strategies that have
brought us success throughout these
years. Our focus is on long-term
growth sustainability and our plans
are to attend to all tasks meticulously
to achieve this growth – growth in
Revenue, growth in EBITDA, growth
in Net Profit, and most importantly,
growth in shareholder value.
Appreciation
On behalf of the Board, I would like
to take this opportunity to extend
my heartfelt thanks to all the staff
for their loyalty and contributions
to the Group during the past year. I
would also like to express my sincere
gratitude to our valued shareholders,
bankers and business associates
for their support and trust. The
Group will continue to build on our
core competence to strengthen our
leadership position.
Let us toast to the bright prospects of
Man Wah Holdings Limited.
Cheers!
Wong Man Li
Chairman
Man Wah Holdings Limited
