Paint and coating products In view of the escalating awareness of more stringent environmental protection and product safety laws and regulations pertaining to the Group s manufacturing facilities and products in the PRC, increasing in price of crude oil, other key raw materials and labour costs, growing market competition of paint and coating products in worldwide as well as increasing capital expenditure for replacement of aging production facilities, the management expects future results and cash flow of the paint and coating products segment will be adversely affected.

LED and semi-conductor lighting products As mentioned above, on 22 September 2010, the Board announced that the Company entered into the S&P with China Century to acquire the entire share capital of Ace Winner, which hold 69.44% of a group of companies registered in the PRC, and principally engages in design, manufacturing and sale of LED and semi-conductor lighting related products.
Details of the new LED business had been disclosed in circular dated 25 February 2011.
LED sector is considered as one of the fast growing industries in the world which is supported by worldwide governments and business sectors. Although the global financial crisis in the late 2008 hit the global economy badly, global market value of LED sector recorded year over year growth rate of approximately 4%, 8%, 12%, 6% and 5% respectively from 2005-2009, based on Photonics Industry & Technology Development Association s research. Besides, according to the research from iSuppli Corporation, driven by the soaring demand in new electronic applications such as LED-TV and general illumination, the compound annual growth rate ( CAGR ) of the revenue of LED market in PRC would be approximately 15.7% from 2009-2014. Energy saving and long life LED will gradually replace traditional lighting in 3 major application areas, i.e. interior and external lighting, display devices and backlighting. Through the Acquisition, the Group can set foot in LED encapsulation business, the middle phase of LED industry, and enable the Group to capture fast growing opportunity of the LED application products market.
As a sunrise industry, the LED market in the PRC is intensive with small local market participants. However, the high capital expenditure requirements and the well functioned research and development team pose significant barriers to entry for new competitors. Nevertheless, with our strong financial position and our expertise, the Board is confident that the new LED business could become the growth driver of the Group and enhance the corporate value for the shareholders.
The management will from time to time seek for investment opportunity in difference phase of LED industry that could improve corporate synergy and broaden the market shares of the Group. Meanwhile, the management will continue to review the performance of existing businesses and seek for any investment opportunity in fast growing industry. Should any suitable business opportunity arise, the Group may change its existing business activities and redeploy any assets of the Group.

On behalf of the Board, I would like to convey its sincere gratitude to our employees for their diligence and contributions to the Group. I would also like to acknowledge the continual support of our customers, suppliers and shareholders during the year of 2010.
For and on behalf of the Board
