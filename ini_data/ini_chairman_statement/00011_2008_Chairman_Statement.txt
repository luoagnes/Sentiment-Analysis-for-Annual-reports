Hang Seng produced excellent results in 2007, achieving attributable profit of HK$18,242 million, an increase of 51.5 per cent, or HK$6,204 million. Earnings per share grew by 51.4 per cent to HK$9.54. Operating profit per full-time employee was HK$1.94 million, up from HK$1.49 million in 2006.
This growth reflects an impressive performance by our wealth management business, successful income diversification efforts by Treasury in an improved operating environment, further development of Commercial Banking and increased contribution from our strategic mainland China associate Industrial Bank.
Net operating income before loan impairment charges and other credit risk provisions rose by 38.3 per cent to HK$25,015 million. This increase considerably outpaced the 26.9 per cent rise in operating expenses, contributing to our improved cost efficiency ratio of 26.6 per cent a reduction of 2.4 percentage points compared with 2006.
Operating profit excluding loan impairment charges increased by 43 per cent to HK$18,365 million. Operating profit was up HK$5,213 million, or 41.5 per cent, at HK$17,789 million.
Profit before tax grew by 49.2 per cent to HK$21,471 million, a figure which includes an unrealised gain of HK$1,465 million on the dilution of our investment in Industrial Bank following its listing in February 2007.
Excluding the gain on dilution, profit before tax was up 39 per cent.
Along with growth in attributable profit, the gain on dilution saw retained profits rise by HK$3,829 million.
The available-for-sale investments reserve also increased.
Overall, shareholders funds (excluding proposed dividends) grew by HK$7,372 million to reach HK$50,720 million as at 31 December 2007.

12 ANNUAL REPORT 2007 HANG SENG BANK Return on average shareholders funds was 35.4 per cent, up from 27.4 per cent in 2006. Excluding the gain on dilution, return on average shareholders funds was 32.6 per cent.
On 31 December 2007, our total and core capital adequacy ratios were 11.2 per cent and 8.4 per cent respectively, as calculated in accordance with new rules under Basel II.
After careful consideration of capital requirements for investment in future business growth, particularly on the Mainland, the Directors have declared a fourth interim dividend of HK$3.00 per share, payable on 28 March 2008. This brings the total distribution for 2007 to HK$6.30 per share, up HK$1.10 compared with 2006.

Hong Kong should maintain good growth momentum in 2008, underpinned by buoyant private consumption and solid business spending in the domestic sector and sustained economic strength on the Mainland.
Challenges include the risk of a further slowdown in the US economy, which will continue to cloud the outlook for exports. Strong domestic demand supported by the tight labour market, low interest rates, and the ongoing weakness of the US dollar and growing strength of the renminbi are all contributing to rising inflation risk.
Overall, we are cautiously optimistic for the year ahead.
Economic fundamentals in Hong Kong and on the Mainland remain sound and domestic demand is now a major impetus for growth.
We will continue to develop our key growth drivers, particularly wealth management services, Commercial Banking and Mainland business. Using our strong brand, leading market position and solid financial fundamentals as a springboard, we will take full advantage of new opportunities to expand our business.
