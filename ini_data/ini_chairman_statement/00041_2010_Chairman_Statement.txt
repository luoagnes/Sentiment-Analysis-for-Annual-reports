CHAIRMAN S STATEMENT 
Set against a volatile background in 2009, the Group managed to achieve a core profit of HK$1,276 million for 2009, a growth of 10.9% over core profit of HK$1,150 million for 2008.
The increase in core profit was driven by an increase of HK$115 million in dividend from the Champion Real Estate Investment Trust (the REIT ), lower net interest expense, which dropped by HK$176 million, and the absence of further write-off of fixed assets associated with hotel renovation, which came to HK$139 million in 2008. Core profit in 2009 was also helped by a one-off write-back of overprovided construction costs for Langham Place, which amounted to 
The Langham Place Mall and Office Tower were injected into Champion REIT in June 2008. Whereas about five months rental income from the properties amounting to HK$218 million was booked in the 2008 accounts, none was recorded for 2009. Mainly as a result of this factor, net rental income from investment properties decreased to HK$164 million in 2009 from HK$338 million in 2008. Net rental income from other investment properties in Hong Kong was down moderately from HK$122 million in 2008 to HK$114 million in 2009 as higher income from Great Eagle Centre was offset by lower income from the furnished apartments. At the properties in the United States, gross rental income was stable at HK$114 million for 2009 as compared to HK$117 million for 2008. With lower re-letting expenses incurred in 2009, net rental income from the properties in the United States has in fact increased from HK$37 million in 2008 to HK$51 million 
Contribution from Champion REIT increased 4.4% year-on- year to HK$848 million in 2009. A higher dividend income of HK$579 million was received from the REIT in 2009 (2008: HK$464 million), the increase in dividends income was due to additional rental income from the newly acquired Langham Place properties, as well as an increased stakeholding in the Champion REIT after taking scrip distributions in place of part of the cash distributions. The dividend increase was more than offset lower asset management fees of HK$205 million received from the REIT for 2009, as compared to HK$285 million for 2008. The 2008 management fee income included a one-time fee of HK$125 million in relation to the acquisition of Langham Place properties by the REIT. Excluding this one- off item, management income would have increased by 28% 
Performance of the Hotels Division was adversely impacted in a significant way during 2009 amid an incredibly difficult economic environment.That was particularly the case in the first half of the year, when both corporate and leisure travel was substantially curtailed. A slight improvement in the operating environments was seen by some of the Group s hotels from the latter part of 2009, with Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR) declined in the second half of the year that were not as steep as that experienced in the first half of 2009.
Nevertheless, the second half of 2009 was another challenging period, with room rates under significant pricing pressure. Revenue from the Hotels division dropped by 16% year-on-year to HK$2,570 million in 2009, strong cost- reduction measures were quickly initiated, which mitigated the decline in the performance of the Hotels Division.
Operating profit from the Hotels Division dropped 34.8% year-on-year to HK$429 million in 2009.
The Group s plan to expand the presence of the hotel brand in key cities around the world was slowed down in 2009 by the financial turmoil. After the opening of The Langham Yangtze Boutique in Shanghai, in the first half of 2009, only one other hotel, the Langham Place Samui opened in December 2009.
Both hotels are operated under pure hotel management contracts with no equity investment from the Group.
We have at the same time been taking advantage of the weak external environment to further grow the hotel portfolio. In 2009, we have added a total of five new hotel management contracts to the pipeline.
While the state of the economy has had a negative impact on the Group s business, the Group was able to accomplish several significant milestones, with the most important one being the acquisition of a site in Dalian, China. The site has been earmarked for mixed-use development, which will help to strengthen and expand the Group s asset base. Given the rapid growth in China s real estate market, the Group believes this investment will help it to capitalize on such a growth 
Despite being one of the most difficult years over the past decade, the Group maintained its strong financial position, with cash and investments in liquid instruments amounted to HK$2,646 million as at the end of December 2009. Net debt increased over the second half of 2009, and stood at HK$1,867 million as at the end of 2009. The increase in net debt was primarily driven by payment on land premium relating to the Dalian project.

Extending the extremely weak demand for rooms from the fourth quarter of 2008, there was little change on the situation over the first half of 2009, with both room and occupancy rates were under significant pressure. In particular, the Group s hotels in the United States were the worst affected. Nonetheless, most markets have begun to show cautious signs of recovery in the latter part of 2009, and the rate of revenue decline has narrowed in the second half of 2009. Revenue from the Hotels Division came to HK$2,570 million in 2009, representing a year-on-year decline of 16%.
HONG KONG OPERATIONS The Langham, Hong Kong Weak market conditions coupled with a fear of the swine flu in April 2009 have contributed to a significantly pullback in demand for rooms from the corporate sector. Despite a drop in Food and Beverage revenues, the implementation of tighter cost controls actually lifted profit derived from the Food and Beverage department in 2009.
For the year 2009, the hotel achieved an average occupancy of 73% (2008: 81%) and an average room rate of HK$1,431 
Langham Place, Hong Kong Cutback in corporate and leisure travel amid a difficult operating environment dragged down performance for the hotel, the negative momentum reversed with strengthening business volumes from the fourth quarter of 2009. Revenues from Food and Beverage trailed behind last year due to reduced demand. Nevertheless, profit from the Food and Beverage department was steady when compared with that last year, given the implementation of a rigorous cost 
For the year 2009, the hotel achieved an average occupancy of 76% (2008: 84%) and an average room rate of HK$1,204 
Eaton Hotel, Hong Kong Due to lacklustre demand and intensified market pressure, room rate at the Eaton Hotel has dropped the most amongst our Hong Kong hotels in 2009. Average room rate dropped by 22% compared with that achieved in 2008. The lower room rate achieved was in part due to increased contribution from the lower yielding segment. Profit from the Food and Beverage department, on the other hand, has shown an increase when compared with that achieved last year, driven by cost reduction and hence improved margins for the Food and Beverage department.
For the year 2009, the hotel achieved an average occupancy of 78% (2008: 89%) and an average room rate of HK$721 
The Langham, London Compared with the rooms available in 2008, when there was an average of 162 rooms available for let, the number of rooms that became available for let increased steadily over 2009, after completion of the main refurbishment programme. From June 2009, 284 rooms were available, and all the 382 rooms were available from September 2009. With the much upgraded public areas, function rooms and Palm Court restaurant, the re-launched of the rooms were well received and a nice increase in all revenue streams was witnessed in the fourth quarter of 2009.
For the year 2009, the hotel achieved an average occupancy of 61%, based on a weighted average of 284 available rooms in 2009, compared to an occupancy rate of 68% achieved in 2008, when there were only 162 available rooms. The average room rate achieved for 2009 was219 (2008:243).
The Langham, Boston In the first half of 2009, the Boston hotel was one of the most impacted from the financial turmoil, given its reliance on guests from the financial sector. The situation reversed dramatically in the second half of 2009, when demand for rooms from the financial sector picked up sharply, and the hotel turned to a profit in the second half of 2009. Food and Beverage revenues recorded a growth of 14% year-on-year, mainly attributed to increased wedding business and the opening of a new restaurant in January 2009.
For the year 2009, the hotel achieved an average occupancy of 59% (2008: 65%) and an average room rate of US$212 
The Langham, Melbourne Of the Group s overseas hotels, performance at the Langham, Melbourne held up better than others, as the city continued to host numerous large scale events to attract domestic and international travellers. The hotel also increased guests from the higher yielding retail segment, which helped to offset a reduction in demand from corporates. Average room rate for the hotel held up in 2009, whereas occupancy rate dropped by 9.1 percentage points year-on-year in 2009. Although the catering business was affected by the reduction in corporate activities, revenues from Food and Beverage was steady on solid restaurants revenue.
For the year 2009, the hotel achieved an average occupancy of 67% (2008: 76%) and an average room rate of A$260 
The Langham, Auckland The renovation of the ballroom and part of the hotel rooms from the middle of 2009 had negatively impacted the hotel s results. Nevertheless, the Group expects the renovated ballroom will enhance and expand the hotel s catering facilities, which will better position the hotel to capture more catering business in the future. The new Chuan Spa, which opened in the second quarter of 2009, is now recognized as one of the best wellness centres in New Zealand.
For the year 2009, the hotel achieved an average occupancy of 62% (2008: 68%) and an average room rate of NZ$168 
The Langham Huntington The significant withdrawals of corporate travel and events have resulted in double-digit declines in all revenue streams for the hotel. The low occupancy for the hotel has put tremendous pressure on profitability for the hotel.
Nevertheless, there were some signs of business pick-up during the fourth quarter of 2009 from citywide events and 
For the year 2009, the hotel achieved an average occupancy of 47% (2008: 57%) and an average room rate of US$224 
Impact from the financial crisis began to significantly affect the Hotel s operating results early in the year with declines in both occupancy and room rate. Corporate and group activities remained quiet during the year and the hotel reacted with marketing activities to secure more leisure travellers to sustain business volume. Revenues from Food and Beverage also slowed on lower occupancy level and reduced corporate events and banquets.
For the year 2009, the hotel achieved an average occupancy of 66% (2008: 73%) and an average room rate of C$122 
Investment in the Champion REIT Income from Champion REIT increased 4.4% from HK$812 million in 2008 to HK$848 million in 2009.
Due to the Group s accounting policy of recognizing distribution income from the Champion REIT at the date of payment of the distribution, the income statement of the Group for a six-month period reflects the distribution declared by the Champion REIT for the immediately preceding six- month period. Therefore the income statement for 2009 recognised the distribution paid by Champion REIT for the second half of 2008 and the first half of 2009. On that basis, distribution income from Champion REIT increased by 24.7% year-on-year to HK$579 million. The increase in distribution income was due to additional rental income from the newly acquired Langham Place properties, and an increase in stakeholding in the Champion REIT after taking scrip distributions in place of part of the cash distributions. Asset and leasing management fee income, on the hand, decreased from HK$348 million in 2008 (which included a HK$125 million one-time acquisition fee in relation to the purchase of the Langham Place properties) to HK$269 million in 2009.
Excluding the impact of the non-recurrent acquisition fee, however, asset and leasing management income from the REIT would have increased by HK$46 million or 21% year-on- year in 2009.
On 22 February 2010, the Champion REIT reported a total distribution of HK$1,312 million for the full year of 2009, and declared a final distribution of HK$0.131 per unit for the second half of 2009, which will be recognised in the Group s results of 2010.
The following are excerpts from Champion REIT s 2009 annual results announcement relating to the performance of the REIT s properties: 
As financial institutions downsized in 2009, there was intense competition for office tenants in Central. Spot rental rates achieved at Citibank Plaza retreated from their peak of HK$120 per sq. ft. to near HK$75 per sq. ft. at the end of the year. The occupancy rate at Citibank Plaza weakened to 87.6%, as compared to 97.9% a year earlier, mainly as a result of relocation decisions made by some cost-sensitive tenants early in 2009 at the height of the financial turmoil.
Passing rental rates (the average rental rate of existing contracted tenancies) at Citibank Plaza continued to see an improvement in the first half of 2009, as the rent rates achieved on leases rolled over in 2009 were on the average higher than the passing rents of expired leases that were signed in 2006. A peak in passing rents was reached in July when negative rental reversions began to have a greater effect. The progressively lower spot rental rates in the following months resulted in a passing rent of HK$90.07 per sq. ft. in December 2009.
Langham Place Office Tower In contrast to the phenomenon of tenant downsizing in Central, the office rental market on the Kowloon Peninsula was more affected by the launch of new space over the past 18 months. Langham Place s reputation as a proven quality development and its attractive subway location allowed the Office Tower to maintain its occupancy at a high level throughout 2009. As of 31st December 2009, the occupancy stood at 98.5%. The office rental rates on the Kowloon Peninsula were however constrained by an overhang of new supply in the Kowloon East districts. The spot rent rates for office space at Langham Place at year-end 2009 ranged from HK$23 to HK$32 per sq. ft., depending on the floor level and the users location sensitivity, as compared to HK$32 to HK$40 per. sq. ft. as of December 2008. The passing rent rate was maintained at roughly the same levels throughout 2009 despite the fall in spot rents, as the new rental rates were in line with the existing passing rental rate, and also because only a relatively small proportion (approximately 6% by floor area) of the leases were rolled over in 2009.
Langham Place Mall Langham Place Mall performed admirably in 2009 reinforcing its status as one of the most popular shopping malls in Kowloon. After a momentary slowdown in tenant sales from the H1N1 influenza scare in the second quarter, the sales momentum of the Mall bounced back quickly in the second half. The Mall remained virtually fully let throughout 2009 and ended the year with an occupancy rate of close to 100%.
Footfall, or the number of visitors, for 2009 was maintained at the high levels of 2008. The resilience of Langham Place Mall was largely the result of its ever-improving mix of quality retailers, which has enhanced its popularity among local shoppers and tourists alike. The Mall s creative promotion and events, including two highly successful mall-wide sale events in April and October 2009 - the first of its kind among shopping centres in Hong Kong, have also generated a considerable amount of goodwill with the retailers. As a result, the majority of leases that fell due during the year were rolled over with increases in their rental. Average passing rent rate of the mall managed to increase to HK$88.61 per lettable sq. ft. by the end of the year.

On 15 October 2009, the Group acquired a development site in Renmin Road East in the city of Dalian. The site, with a gross developable floor area of approximately 286,000 sq.
metres, was acquired through auction for approximately RMB734 million. We believe the accommodation value of just over RMB2,500 per sq. metre is very reasonable for this prime 
The site has been earmarked for mixed-use development, which will comprise a luxury international hotel and high-end apartments. As at the end of 2009, the Group has paid RMB520 million (equivalent to HK$591 million) as part of the deposit for the site acquisition and the rest of the land cost is expected to be paid in the second quarter of 2010. It is intended that the site will be developed in several phases with proceeds from pre-sales to fund part of the development cost.
Preparations for the development are already under way with the principal consultants having been appointed. Foundation works are expected to begin in the middle of 2010.
It is the intention of the Group to invite joint venture investors to participate in the project, with the Group acting as the asset and project manager with remuneration and profit sharing. This should enhance the return on the Group s equity investment in the project.

Hong Kong Commercial Properties Great Eagle Centre After a slow start in 2009 for leasing activities, the situation reversed dramatically in the second half, when demand from Mainland Chinese companies and other small and medium size companies picked up strongly. As a result, the vacancy rate was brought down and the downward rental trend was quickly reversed. The property actually ended the year with achieved rent rates higher than those at the beginning of the 
Gross rental income of the property grew by 10% year-on- year from HK$92 million to HK$101 million in 2009. However, due to costs incurred for relocating and upgrading the cooling water pumping facilities, net rental income increased only 1% year-on-year to HK$90 million for 2009. The relocation of the pumping system was requested by the Government as part of the Central-Wanchai reclamation project.
As at the end of 2009, occupancy rate at Great Eagle Centre stood at 99.4%, as compared to 93.6% as at the end of 
Eaton House Furnished Apartments Continuing the lackluster demand for furnished apartments from the fourth quarter of 2008, the performance of the Group s furnished apartments continued to come under pressure in 2009. A surge in supply of furnished apartments on the Hong Kong Island side further exacerbated the already weak leasing environment, with occupancy for the Group s furnished apartments falling 21 percentage points year-on- year to 57% as at the end of 2009. Net rental income dropped 32% from HK$25.5 million in 2008 to HK$17.4 million in 2009.
United States Commercial Properties Due to lower occupancy at 500 Ygnacio, which fell from 87% at year-end 2008 to 75% at the end of 2009, gross rental income from properties in the United States dropped 2.5% from HK$117.1 million in 2008 to HK$114.1 million in 2009.
Gross rental income from 353 Sacramento and 2700 Ygnacio were steady in 2009, with occupancy rates of 95% and 96% respectively as at the end of 2009. Net rental income however increased from HK$36.9 million in 2008 to HK$50.7 million in 2009, mainly due to lower re-letting costs.

Gross debts denominated in HK dollars amounted to HK$1,355 million as of 31 December 2009. Our foreign currency gross debts as of 31 December 2009 amounted to the equivalent of HK$3,158 million, of which the equivalent of HK$550 million, or 17.4% of our foreign currency debts, was on fixed-rate basis. Net of cash and bank deposits that matures within 3 months totalling the equivalent of HK$1,921 million, our consolidated net debt outstanding as of 31 December 2009 was HK$2,592 million, an increase of HK$1,559 million from that of HK$1,033 million as of 31 
Because of the persistent low interest rate environment and in order to enhance return to shareholders, as a normal treasury function the Group has been prudently investing in quality short-term bonds which are intended to be held to maturity, and full principal protected structured deposits and notes with reputable banks and financial institutions as counter-parties.
As at 31 December 2009, investment in these bonds, structured deposits and notes amounted to HK$725 million.
Should this amount be taken into account, the consolidated net borrowing of the Group would be reduced to HK$1,867 
Equity Attributable to Shareholders, based on professional valuation of the Group s investment properties as of 31 December 2009 and the depreciated costs of the Group s hotel properties, amounted to HK$22,317 million as of 31 December 2009. The net assets value at 31 December 2009 represents an increase of HK$4,342 million compared to the value of HK$17,975 million as of 31 December 2008, mainly attributable to the profit for the year and the increase in fair value of the Group s investment in Champion REIT units.
Based on the consolidated net debt of HK$2,592 million, the resulting gearing ratio at 31 December 2009 was 12%.
Should the investment in bonds, structured deposits and notes mentioned above be recognized in the calculation, the gearing ratio will be reduced to 8%.

During the year, market interest rate has remained at an extremely low level. Coupled with the high interest income from the Group s investment in Champion REIT convertible bonds, the Group has earned a net interest income of HK$40 million for 2009. Consequently, there is no applicable interest cover ratio as at the balance sheet date (31 December 2008: 
Liquidity and Debt Maturity Profile As of 31 December 2009, our cash, bank deposits and committed but undrawn loan facilities amounted to a total of HK$3,773 million. The majority of our loan facilities is short or medium term in nature and is secured by properties with sufficient value to loan coverage. The following is a profile of the maturity of our outstanding debts as of 31 December 
Within 1 year 5.7% 1-2 years 35.5% 3-5 years 58.8% Pledge of Assets At 31 December 2009, properties of the Group with a total carrying value of approximately HK$9,895 million (31 December 2008: HK$12,486 million), were mortgaged or pledged to secure credit facilities granted to its subsidiaries.
Commitments and Contingent Liabilities As at 31 December 2009, the Group has authorised capital expenditures not provided for in these financial statements amounting to approximately HK$309 million (31 December 2008: HK$264 million) of which approximately HK$309 million (31 December 2008: HK$263 million) was contracted 
Other than set out above, the Group did not have any significant commitments and contingent liabilities as at 31 
After a challenging and difficult year in 2009, the world economies have stabilized. The China economy has been particularly strong. Nevertheless, certain risks remain in the year ahead, as the recovery has been uneven globally. The impact of the potential withdrawal of government stimuli will also add uncertainties to the environment that we operate in.
Therefore there will continue to be volatility in the performance of some of our business segments in the near term. Notwithstanding these challenges, we have well positioned ourselves to benefit from an improving economy and to capitalize on new opportunities for growth.
At the beginning of 2010, the Central Grade-A market appears to be bottoming out in terms of both occupancy and rent rates. The present vacancy rate at Citibank Plaza is higher than the general market. However, the level of enquiries received at Citibank Plaza has evidently picked up in early 2010 though it may take time to translate the enquiries into actual occupancy. With an additional 18.2% of the leases in Citibank Plaza by floor area falling due in 2010, it may be possible for vacancies to go further up from the present level before they come down again. That will have a negative impact on the income of Citibank Plaza in 2010. Nevertheless, with the economy recovering, and the shortage of new supply in Central for a long time to come, Citibank Plaza should be well positioned to return to high occupancy in the ensuing up 
On the Kowloon side, a continuing overhang of new office supply in the peripheral Kowloon East area will continue to be a factor, but the continued high occupancy of the Langham Place Office Tower in 2009 has proven its ability to retain tenants in spite of its substantial rental premium. Over 35% of the Office Tower was originally due for expiry in 2010. To date, many early rollovers have been successfully negotiated, and the remaining 2010 expiries now cover only 20% of floor space, thereby limiting the downside in terms of 2010 occupancy. However there should be a modest amount of negative rental reversion in cases where the tenants are in trades that are less location sensitive.
The prospects are much better for the Langham Place Mall, which has proved to be a good balance countering the higher income volatility of the Central office market. The positive rental reversion on leases done during 2009 (representing approximately 18% of the floor area) will translate into higher income for the Mall in 2010. While a number of new mid- sized shopping centres are being launched in TsimShaTsui, Kowloon in 2010, we expect that Langham Place will be able to compete effectively in view of its unique market positioning and strong location.
For our hotel portfolio, the pace of demand contraction has begun to ease from the latter part of 2009, suggesting that the worst may have passed. Nevertheless, it would take time for room rates to fully recover. Therefore our hotel management team will continue to work diligently to control costs in order to maintain earnings momentum. We will also continue to seek other hotel management contracts to further leverage on the increasing recognition of our hotel brand.
Despite the many challenges faced by the Group in the past year, the longer-term fundamentals of our businesses are continuously improving. With our very strong balance sheet and low financial gearing, we are ready to proactively expand our investments in a prudent manner.
LO Ka Shui Chairman and Managing Director Hong Kong , 24 February 2010
