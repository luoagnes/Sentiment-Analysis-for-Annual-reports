Chairman s Letter 
The Group continued to build up its core strengths in 2007. The completion of the acquisition of the front loading washing machine and water heater businesses from the Company s controlling shareholders, Haier Group Corporation and Qingdao Haier Investment and Development Co., Ltd together with their subsidiaries (collectively the Haier Group ), in December 2006 significantly broadened the Group s revenue and earnings basis in 2007. In addition, the booming PRC economy results in significant growth in consumer spending.
Coupled with measures taken by the Group to rationalize its cost structure and fine-tune its business model to enhance operational efficiency, the Group is able to achieve satisfactory results in 2007.

Turnover from continuing operations amounted to HK$8,549 million, representing an increase of approximately 23.9% from HK$6,902 million in 2006.
The Group continues to maintain leading positions in the washing machine and water heater markets in the PRC, with respective market share of approximately 31.9% and 20.4% in 2007 according to China Market Monitor (a market research company based in the PRC). EBITDA margin improved from 4.3% in 2006 to 4.9% in 2007 while operating margin also improved from 3.2% in 2006 to 3.9% in 2007 as a result of our launch of innovative high value added products and improvement in operational 
Excluding the net profit from the discontinued mobile handset operation of HK$103 million (which mainly arose from the gain on disposal of this business) in the previous period in 2006, profit for the year from continuing operations increased by approximately 22.8% as compared to 2006, reaching HK$225.7 million in 2007.

In December 2007, the Group acquired the remaining 30% interest in Haier Indesit (Qingdao) Washing Machine Co., Ltd. and Haier Indesit (Qingdao) Electrical Appliance Co., Ltd. (collectively Haier Indesit ), which are engaged in the manufacture and sale of front loading washing machines, from the Italian partner Indesit Group. The acquisition is expected to enable the Group to have better and more effective management control over Haier Indesit, enable more effective sharing of resources with other subsidiaries of the Group and thus improving our operating efficiencies from 2008 onwards. In addition, in the past, the Group had to pay a trademark licence fee to the parent company Haier Group at a rate of 0.8% of sales of top loading washing machines. In order to facilitate further growth of the Group, the Haier Group agreed to waive such trademark licence fee, which represented approximately 17.8% of the profit from continuing operations of the Group in 2007, with effect from 1 January 2008. The waiver is expected to improve financial performance of the Group from 2008 onwards.
Despite measures being taken by the PRC government to cool down the economy, we are still seeing substantial growth in consumer spending and we remain optimistic on the washing machine and water heater markets in the PRC, in particular in the 3rd and 4th tier cities and rural area in view of the growing brand consciousness of the consumers in these markets, and the government s policy to improve living standard in the rural area. In addition, although sales for exports currently only account for approximately 10% of total revenue, with Haier being a sponsor to the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008, we believe our brand recognition will be significantly enhanced in overseas markets, which is expected to help our growth in export sales from 2008 onwards. Coupled with the acquisition of the remaining 30% interest in Haier Indesit and the waiver of trademark licence fee as mentioned above, we are optimistic about the prospects of the Group in the forthcoming year.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank all my fellow directors and staff for their dedicated services, contributions and support during the year.
By Order of the Board of Haier Electronics Group Co., Ltd.
