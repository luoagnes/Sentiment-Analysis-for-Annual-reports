CHAIRMAN S STATEMENT 
PRC manufacturing business Steel pipes factory 6 0{M"! ( North China ), which was set up by the Group together with 6 i0M# , is famous for the production of high quality steel pipes, providing high quality steel pipes to satisfy the demand for transportation of natural gas from Western China to the eastern part and earned high reputation for its pipes which were widely used in other pipe projects. North China has set up a branch factory in the Yangzhou Han Jiang Industrial Park, the PRC, to enhance its competitiveness and capture a larger market share in the eastern part of the PRC. The branch factory, mainly engaged in the production of steel pipes with medium to small size bore, has formally commenced operation in early 2006.

In 2005, North China had a total output of 69,000 tonnes (2004: 115,000 tonnes) steel pipe and 175,000 tonnes (2004: 125,000 tonnes) of steel pipes were processed, generating a profit of HK$25,764,000 (2004: HK$26,324,000) for the Group which represented a decrease of 2.13% as compared with last year.

Profit after tax attributable to the Group for the year was HK$234,000 (2004: HK$1,905,000). With the PRC s accession to the World Trade Organisation, demand for packaging materials will gradually increase. In this connection, the Group once again worked with Daqing Bureau to invest in the construction of a CPP film production line which was expected to commence production this year. This operation is temporarily affected by high cost, high supply and low demand in the short run, and is suffering a hard time with low profits. Competition within the industry was extremely intense and only the strong ones might survive. The management of the film factory is now actively improving quality, controlling cost and perfecting products. Its products have gained high recognitions in the market and are at the higher end of the market, laying foundation for further development in the future. The Group is confident that when various factors are stabilised, this project will provide the Group with a steady income.

The positioning of the Group s future development remains unchanged. It still focuses on investing in petroleum up-stream business as well as other petroleum-related business with stable income. The Group will continue to explore new business opportunities, increase oil reserves, invest in projects with lower risk and reasonable return in different regions and develop petroleum-related business in the PRC and overseas.

With a strong financial position and prudent approach, the Group aims at expanding into an international oil corporation. The future crude oil price is expected to maintain at a relatively high level. The Group will accelerate on the exploration and development of existing oil projects, increase production volume, strengthen the management, control costs, increase efficiency and stabilise income, and for the sake of the shareholders, make new acquisitions with an aim to increasing crude oil reserves and production, enhance revenue and increase shareholders return.
