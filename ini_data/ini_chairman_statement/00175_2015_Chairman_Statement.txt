China s passenger vehicle market achieved a stable growth in 2014, featured by slowdown in the growth of demand for sedans and continued strong demand for Sport Utility Vehicles ( SUVs ) and Multi-Purpose Vehicles ( MPVs ).
Although the sales of indigenous brand passenger vehicles had steadily recovered since September 2014, its growth continued to lag behind the foreign joint venture brands. The sales volume of indigenous brand passenger vehicles grew 4.1% year-on-year ( YoY ) in 2014, compared with the 9.9% YoY growth of the overall China passenger vehicle market according to China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.

The sales volume of our group in the China market was down 16.8% YoY in 2014 amid the implementation of a series of major structural reforms in our sales and marketing functions started from mid-2013 through 2014. The performance of our group s export sales was also seriously challenged, mainly due to the political instability in some of its major export markets, and the weakening of emerging market currencies against United States Dollar ( US$ ) in 2014. Despite this, our group continued to improve its competitive advantages and achieved good market shares in most of its major export markets in 2014, reflecting the improved competitiveness of its products. Our group s export sales volume achieved a 49.8% YoY decline in 2014 but this contributed a respectful 11.2% of the total export of China s passenger vehicles in 2014 according to China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, making us one of the leading vehicle exporters in China.

GEELY AUTOMOBILE HOLDINGS LIMITED Annual Report 2014 
Our group sold a total of 417,851 units of vehicles in 2014, down 24.0% from 2013, of which 14.3% or 59,721 units were sold abroad, down 49.8% from last year. In the Chinese market, our group s sales volume in 2014 was down 16.8% from last year to 358,130 units. EC7 , together with Xindihao (an upgraded version of EC7 launched in late July 2014), Geely Kingkong and our SUV model GX7 were the major contributors to our group s sales volume in 
Our group s financial performance in 2014 was below expectations with total revenue decreased by 24% to RMB21.7 billion for the year ended 31 December 2014. This was due to the slower sales volume caused by the reshuffle of our group s sales and marketing system in China, and the deterioration in political and economic environment in some of our major export countries. Our group s average per unit sales price improved slightly in 2014 as the improvement in product mix (i.e. higher proportion of higher-priced models) more than offset the discounts offered to domestic dealers during the year. The flagship mid size sedan model EC7 , together with its upgraded version named Xindihao , remained our group s most popular models in terms of sales volume, accounting for 38.9% of its total sales volume in 2014. Total net profit of our group was down 46% from RMB2.68 billion in 2013 to RMB1.45 billion in 2014 due to decline in overall sales volume and the unrealized foreign exchange loss at our Russia subsidiary. After accounting for non-controlling interests, our net profit attributable to shareholders was down 46% from RMB2.66 billion in 2013 to RMB1.43 billion in 2014. Diluted earnings per share was down 47% to RMB16.25 cents. Despite this, our group continued to generate good operational cash flow during the year. The issuance of US$300 million 5.25% five-year senior notes in October 2014 further strengthened our financial position with total cash level (bank balances and cash + pledged bank deposits) increasing 30% to RMB7.25 billion at the end of 2014.

The Board recommends the payment of a final dividend of HK$2.5 cents per share for 2014 (2013: HK$4.6 cents).

Despite increasing challenges and fierce competition in both our domestic and export markets, we have achieved initial success in our product development and the restructuring of sales and marketing functions, further enhancing the quality of our products and services and improving the efficiency of our sales and distribution capabilities. Dedicated to the mission of Creating Fine Cars for Everybody ( k PN v|T) under Geely brand, I have no doubt that the successful execution of these changes would lead our group entering into a new development era (i.e. New Geely Era (e T)RBfN)) and becoming a much stronger Geely in the 
The technological cooperation between our group and Volvo Car Corporation ( Volvo Car ), which is majority owned by our group s parent Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Company Limited ( Geely Holding ), has achieved significant progress during the year, enabling our group to further optimizing resource utilization, and speeding up the implementation of platform strategy, standardization, and shared modularization in product development, thereby bringing about the benefits of synergy to our product quality and brand image which should equip us with a strong and unique advantage over our competitors. I am confident that the synergy benefits for both companies could become increasingly obvious in the coming years, thus boding well for our group s sustainable competitive strength in the areas of technology, quality and 
I firmly believe that our group is on the right track to achieve its long-term goal of becoming a leading global automobile group with good reputation and integrity, winning respects from our customers. Finally, I would like to pay tribute to all our staff for their hard work and achievements during 2014 and to our shareholders for their continued support.
