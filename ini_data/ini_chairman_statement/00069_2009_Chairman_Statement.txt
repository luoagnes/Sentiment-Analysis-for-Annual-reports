Chairman s Statement 2008 On behalf of the Board I am pleased to present the Annual Report of Shangri-La Asia Limited covering the financial year 2008.
The year started on a strong note with most hotels maintaining their performance levels achieved through 2007. However from the second quarter of the year the progressive deterioration in the world financial markets started to affect the regional economies of Asia as well as a decline in visitor arrivals and travel spending in the region.
Whilst Group revenue increased in 2008 to US$1,353,271,000 (2007: US$l,219,248,000), net profit attributable to shareholders in 2008 declined to US$165,940,000 (2007: US$340,863,000). This was after providing for minority interests as well as exceptional items (losses) of US$82,915,000 which comprised mainly of fair value year end adjustments on financial investment and interest rate hedging commitments.
Earnings per share declined to US5.76 cents per share (2007: US12.76 cents 
A final dividend of HK$0.10 per ordinary share has been proposed for FY2008.
Together with the interim dividend of HK$0.14 per ordinary share, the total dividend for FY2008 will be HK$0.24 per ordinary share.
The Group operated 60 hotels at the end of 2008 up from 57 hotels at the end of 2007 with equity invested in 45 hotels and the remaining 15 hotels 
We were extremely fortunate in early May to have avoided any casualties or significant damage to hotel property when fierce storms and floods swept through parts of Myanmar and an earthquake erupted in Sichuan province. Despite the dangerous and demanding circumstances surrounding each disaster, our hotel management and staff continued to watch over the safety and provided comfort and care to all our hotel guests as well as to the local community.
In August Beijing celebrated its hosting of the Olympic Games. Much excitement and anticipation built up in the months preceding this event.
However, as a result of strict visa issuance controls due to mounting public security issues, the budgeted foreign visitor arrivals and subsequent high hotel room occupancies failed to materialize.
The outlook in 2009 for the global economy and for the hotel industry remains depressed. However, with uncertainty, there lies opportunity. The Group will continue to focus on improving our product as well as service offerings whilst prudently looking for new investment opportunities.
The Group has opened four new hotels so far this year and has plans to open another six hotels before the end of 2009.
I would like to thank the management and staff for their hard work and dedication during the year and my fellow board members for their support and
