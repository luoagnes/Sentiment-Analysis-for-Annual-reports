H L Kam Chairman 
2011 was a landmark year for Hui Xian REIT as we became the fi rst RMB-denominated equity listed in Hong Kong.
I am delighted to present the inaugural annual results of Hui Xian REIT for the period from the listing date on 29 April 2011 to 31 December 2011 ( Reporting Period ).
RESULTS AND DISTRIBUTIONS Total revenue and net property income during the Reporting Period amounted to RMB 1,588 million and RMB 1,063 
The fi nal distribution per unit ( DPU ) for the six months ended 31 December 2011 was RMB 0.1064. Together with the interim distribution per unit of RMB 0.0403, Hui Xian REIT provides a total distribution per unit for the Reporting Period of RMB 0.1467. This represents an annualised distribution yield of 6.09% based on the closing unit price of RMB 3.56 as at 31 December 2011.
Total Distributable Income during the Reporting Period was RMB 735 million. Pursuant to the Distribution Policy stipulated in the Offering Circular, 100% of this amount will be distributed to the Unitholders.
DISTRIBUTION REINVESTMENT ARRANGEMENT The Manager recommends that, a distribution reinvestment arrangement will be made available to Unitholders, subject to obtaining authorisation from the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong (the SFC ) of relevant documents. Under the distribution reinvestment arrangement, eligible Unitholders will be entitled to have a scrip distribution in lieu of a cash distribution. Unitholders can elect to receive their distribution in the form of cash, or in the form of new Units of Hui Xian REIT, or a combination of both.
Subject to the SFC s authorisation, an announcement providing further information on the distribution reinvestment arrangement will be published on or about 23 March 2012 and a circular containing the relevant details together with the relevant election form will be sent to all qualifi ed Unitholders on or about 28 March 2012.

Over the past few years, we have witnessed the rapid development of Hong Kong as the premier offshore RMB centre in the world. Hong Kong hosts the largest pool of RMB liquidity outside of Mainland China providing an impetus to support the development of RMB investment products. As the fi rst RMB-denominated equity initial public offering ( IPO ) outside of Mainland China, Hui Xian REIT s successful listing in April 2011 marked an important milestone for Hong Kong s fi nancial market.
At the time of listing, Hui Xian REIT s portfolio comprised Oriental Plaza, one of the largest and most iconic commercial developments in Beijing, China. As the world s second largest economy, China recorded a 9.2% gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth in 2011, outpacing the growth of other economies. Beijing, the capital city of China, registered a compound annual growth rate ( CAGR ) of 15.9% in GDP in the past ten years.

As Hui Xian REIT was listed on 29 April 2011, no direct year-on-year fi nancial comparison can be made. Nonetheless, we are pleased to share with you the full year operating performance of Oriental Plaza for 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.
Oriental Plaza has been established as one of the leading commercial properties in Beijing for over ten years and has achieved a CAGR of 17.2% in operating profi t from 2002 to 2010. The 800,000 sq m complex comprises four businesses: The Malls, The Tower Offi ces, The Tower Apartments and Grand Hyatt Beijing.
Oriental Plaza s operating profi t (2002 2011) presented in RMB million 
Oriental Plaza s growth momentum continued in 2011, driven by Beijing s robust economic conditions. Total revenue was RMB 2,302 million, an increase of 9.6% compared to 2010. Net property income grew 8.5% year-on-year to RMB 1,524 million in 2011.

The Malls continued to benefi t from Beijing s buoyant retail environment and rising domestic consumption.
In 2011, leasing momentum at The Malls was strong. A number of new international retailers and food and beverage outlets were introduced to The Malls. The number of tenants on the waiting list has remained high.
The average occupancy rate for 2011 was 99.1%. Net property income reached RMB 725 million, a 6.1% increase over 2010. This growth can be mainly attributed to higher rents from new leases as well as positive rental reversions, which was 21.7% in 2011. The average monthly spot rent for 2011 was RMB 1,171 per sq m.
The Tower Offi ces Beijing s offi ce leasing market was robust throughout 2011. The expansion of many international and domestic corporations boosted rental demand and supported growth in Beijing s offi ce rents. Limited new supply of quality offi ce space also further underpinned rental growth.
The Tower Offi ces delivered an outstanding performance with strong rental turnover, especially in the second half of 2011. The rental reversion rate for 2011 was 37.7% and the average occupancy rate for 2011 was 96.9%. Net property income reached RMB 533 million, an 8.3% increase over 2010. The monthly spot rent for the second half of 2011 increased to RMB 278 per sq m gross compared to RMB 221 per sq m gross for the fi rst half of 2011.

The Tower Apartments The Tower Apartments also achieved a standout performance, with net property income increasing by 47.4% year-on-year to RMB 56 million. The average occupancy rate for 2011 was 90.3%.
There was strong leasing demand for The Tower Apartments in 2011, driven by the expansion of multinational companies and growth of expatriate population in Beijing.
Grand Hyatt Beijing As the political and economic centre of China, Beijing has experienced positive growth in the business tourism and hotel sector in 2011. Grand Hyatt Beijing s net property income in 2011 was RMB 210 million, an increase of 9.4% over the previous year. The average occupancy rate for 2011 was 66.3%, while the average room rate per night was RMB 1,741, a 12.2% increase from 2010. Revenue per available room ( RevPAR ) was RMB 1,155, 13.4% over 2010.
STRONG FINANCIAL POSITION As at 31 December 2011, Gross Asset Value was RMB 33,995 million and Net Asset Value was RMB 25,972 million, representing increases of 1.9% and 0.7% over 30 June 2011 respectively. Appraised Values of Oriental Plaza was RMB 33,190 million as at 31 December 2011.
Hui Xian REIT s cash on hand amounted to RMB 883 million, providing ample cashfl ow to satisfy working capital and 
Following the early repayment of a fi ve-year term loan on 1 July 2011, the debt to gross asset value ratio of Hui Xian REIT was 0.6% as at 31 December 2011, the lowest among Hong Kong-listed REITs. We believe that our strong fi nancial position and borrowing capacity will further strengthen our acquisition and expansion capabilities.
In November 2011, we announced that Hui Xian REIT has signed a commitment letter for a HK$1,200 million loan facility. The new facility was drawn down in full in January 2012 for the purpose of fi nancing the general corporate 
FIRST ACQUISITION SINCE LISTING In November 2011, Hui Xian REIT announced the fi rst acquisition since listing. By acquiring 70% of Shenyang Lido 1 at RMB 980 million, Hui Xian REIT will enjoy an additional income stream generated by Sheraton Shenyang Lido Hotel.
By entering the Preferred Distribution Agreement with the vendor, the implied yield for this project is 6.57% 2 . The transaction was completed on 1 January 2012.

As we entered into 2012, we believe that China will continue to be a major force of global economic growth attracting even more multinational companies and international retail brands to the country. This in turn will propel demand for quality commercial spaces and hotels.

At the end of December 2011, offshore RMB deposits in Hong Kong totalled RMB 588.5 billion, a signifi cant 87% rise from the previous year. The exchange rate of RMB to Hong Kong dollars has appreciated 2.9% 3 since the listing. We believe that Hui Xian REIT s liquidity will further increase as more RMB investment products are introduced in Hong 
Looking forward, we will continue to focus on the following areas: (1) Organic Growth We are committed to fostering the organic growth from our assets, Oriental Plaza and Sheraton Shenyang Lido Hotel, through active asset management. The latter asset will begin to bring an additional and immediate income stream to Hui Xian REIT commencing 1 January 2012.
(2) Asset Enhancement Initiatives Asset enhancement initiatives will be a key component for Hui Xian REIT s growth. Grand Hyatt Beijing has set out a three-year renovation programme to upgrade guest rooms, restaurants and other facilities. Asset improvement works have also been continually implemented at The Malls and The Tower Offi ces.

The acquisition of Sheraton Shenyang Lido Hotel has marked our fi rst step towards growing Hui Xian REIT s portfolio. Currently, we are assessing over 10 projects in China s fi rst and second-tier cities spanning offi ce, retail, serviced apartment and hotel sectors as well as mixed-use developments. With a healthy balance sheet and a low gearing ratio, Hui Xian REIT is well positioned to capture investment opportunities in China.
As China s fundamental growth drivers continue to propel the economy, we believe that Hui Xian REIT, with our inherent strengths, is well placed to capitalise on China s bright prospects and offer its Unitholders a stable and 
On behalf of the Manager, I would like to express my gratitude to our trustee and Unitholders for the support and confi dence rendered to us.
