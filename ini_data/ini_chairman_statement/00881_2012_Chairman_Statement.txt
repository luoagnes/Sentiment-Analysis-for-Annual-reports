Chairman s Statement 
Dear honourable shareholders, On behalf of the board of directors (the Board ) of Zhongsheng Group Holdings Limited ( Zhongsheng or the Company ), it is my pleasure to present the annual report of the Company and its subsidiaries (the Group ) for 2011.
By capitalizing on the continuous expansion of its dealership network, through both organic growth and acquisitions and the multiple brand portfolio advantages, the Group achieved outstanding results in various aspects in 2011. During the period under review, the Company achieved a revenue of RMB41,903.4 million, representing an increase of 74% from RMB24,042.9 million for the year of 2010.
Profit reached RMB1,643.1 million, representing an increase of 52% from RMB1,082.4 million for the year of 2010. Earnings per share was RMB0.74 (2010: RMB0.56). Furthermore, the Group was selected by Forbes as The 50 BEST Publicly Traded Companies in Asia-Pacific ( FAB50 ) in 2011 . As the only automobile dealership enterprise in the Asia region to win the award, the Group s leading position in the automobile dealership industry was further established.
Due to the termination of the government s favourable tax concession policy towards small emission vehicles, growth of new car sales in China has started to slowdown in 2011, transforming from the two years of rapid growth in 2009 and 2010 to a period steady and sustainable growth. Furthermore, although the production and sales of Japanese made passenger vehicles were affected by the earthquake during the second quarter, with the joint efforts and coordination of manufacturers and parts suppliers, production of Japanese passenger vehicles resumed normal levels by the third quarter, with the sales figures bouncing back during the second half of the year. The accumulative vehicle sales in 2011 was over 160,000 cars, representing an increase of about 60%, of which about 35,000 cars were of luxury brands and 125,000 were of mid-to-high-end brands, an increase of approximately 110% and 50% respectively, and exceeding the 5.2% industry growth rate of passenger cars in China in 2011.
At the beginning of the year, the Ministry of Commerce of the PRC ( MOFCOM ) issued guidelines on the 12th 5-year plan on the development of the automotive distribution industry (the Guidelines ), emphasizing the further enhancement of the sales and services of the industry, and supporting qualified automotive distribution enterprises to merge and restructure cross-region operations, develop chain dealerships and forge 3 5 large automakers with an annual output of more than RMB100 billion. The Guidelines also directed enterprises to build convenient and effective automobile sales and service network, creating own service brands, develop sound dealership network and strengthen after-sales service, while at the same time, promoted the second-hand car market, by quickly establishing a reliable, systematic and effective second-hand car dealership network. The published Guidelines clearly stated the State s attention to and support of the automobile dealership industry, which reinforces the management s confidence in the Group s future sustained development.
The outstanding results we achieved during 2011 were attributed to the loyal services and contribution of all employees of the Group as well as the support and encouragement from all shareholders and business partners. On behalf of the Board, I wish to express my sincere gratitude to all our employees, shareholders and business partners.
