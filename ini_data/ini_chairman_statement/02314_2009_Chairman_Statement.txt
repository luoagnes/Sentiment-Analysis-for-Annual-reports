Chairman s Statement 
For the fiscal year of 20082009, the Group achieved a turnover of HK$9,649 million and has recorded a profit attributable to equity holders of the Company of HK$302 million. During the year, the Group recorded unprecedented losses in the third quarter due to global financial tsunami resulting in a sharp contraction of the market and drop in our selling prices which greatly impacted on the full year s results of the Group.
During the year, our PM12 in Hongmei plant and PM13 in Chonqging plant commenced production, and thereby boosting the Group s total annual containerboard capacity to 3.76 million tons. As the global economic situation slowly improves, our fourth quarter s performance was back within normal range in terms of sales volume and profitability. The management remains optimistic about the future.

The management believes that the worst is definitely over. Our 165,000 tons per annum pulp production line at Chonqging plant is now in trial production phase. While not increasing the debt level, we are now planning to start PM16 to meeting the growing demands of containerboard. Further, the Group will start the production of fine paper to take full advantage of our own forest and pulp resources.
In the meantime, the management will focus on cost control, sales network expansion, more value-added services to our customers, and products diversification. Financially, the management will focus on improvement of cash flow and debt reduction, which includes the postponement of our Vietnam expansion plans and the reduction of working capital needs in order to increase our competitiveness. When the global economic situation improves, we expect to generate higher profits and a better return for our shareholders and potential
