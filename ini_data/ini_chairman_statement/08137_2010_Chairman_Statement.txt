Chairman s Statement 
I report the activities of the Company and its subsidiaries (together the Group ) for the year ended 31 December 
2009 was a year to differentiate Honbridge with our major competitors. Whilst many smaller players in the highly purified silicon industry have been eliminated by the market, Honbridge remained active in the market and continued to grow. With its conservative financial management and flexible development strategy to deal with economic downturn, Honbridge managed to capture the opportunity to expand in the energy and resources sector.
In react to the short term rise in raw materials cost and significant drop in selling price of silicon products, the Group had suspended a major production line in the first half of 2009 and resumed it in the second half of the year when the materials cost and selling price returned to a reasonable level. By taking this time-out strategy, the Group is able to cut losses from HK$19.9 million in 2008 to HK$18.0 million in 2009 before taking into account the goodwill impairment of HK$35.7 million that has no impact to cashflows, and at the same time reducing its inventories from HK$14.1 million in 2008 to HK$6.0 million in 2009.

The Group s silicon business stays healthy and steady at the beginning of 2010. Technology of the 4-5N silicon production is improved and the production cost per unit is under control. The Group is actively looking for potential buyers for large scale production.
On the other hand, the Group plans to expand its business in the energy and resources sector. The first move is to acquire a 66% stake in Xianglan Do Brasil Mineracao Ltda, a company engaged in the exploration of manganese resources in Brazil. Details of the acquisition are contained in the Company s circular dated 24 February 2010.
The next step is to acquire an iron ore exploration company, Sul Americana de Metais S.A. ( SAM ) in Brazil. A Memorandum of Understanding has been entered into between the Group and Votorantim Novos Negocios Ltda, the holding company of SAM and one of the largest industrial conglomerates in Latin America. The progress of the SAM acquisition has been disclosed in the Company s announcement on 18 November 2009, 18 December 2009, 29 January 2010 and 3 March 2010. Further information will be announced in due course.

On behalf of the Board, I would like to take this opportunity to thank our shareholders for their continued support during 2009 and all staff for their hard work.
