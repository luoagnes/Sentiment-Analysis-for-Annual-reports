Chairman s Statement Despite the fact that the global economy continued to be weak in 2002, the Group has been able to achieve an increase of 67% in profits attributable to shareholders. However, in view of the continuing uncertainty in the property market, the directors have considered it prudent to make an additional provision of HK$266 million for its Constellation Cove development in Tai Po, Hong Kong during the year. At the same time, the Group has also taken steps to replenish its land bank whilst improving the quality of its properties and its services. It has also continued with the expansion of its logistics network in the region. The Group believes it is now in a very strong position to capture any new opportunities to expand when they arise.
I am pleased to report to shareholders the annual results of the Group for the year ended 31 December 
The Group s consolidated profit attributable to shareholders increased by 67% to HK$660 million from HK$396 million achieved in 2001. The reasons for the increase in the Group s earnings in 2002 are mainly due to the successful sales of Jupiter Terrace, the lowering of finance costs and a reduction in specific provisions made for Constellation Cove during the year.
In view of the continuing uncertainty in the Hong Kong property market, the Directors have considered it prudent to make an additional provision of HK$133 million in respect of Constellation Cove in Tai Po Kau in the second half of 2002. Together with the HK$133 million provision made as at 30 June 2002, total additional provisions of HK$266 million have been made for this project for the year ended 31 December 2002. Aggregated with the HK$360 million provision made in 2001, a total provision of HK$626 million has been made for the project. The Group s 75% share of the HK$266 million provision made in 2002 amounted to approximately HK$200 million whilst the Group s 75% share of the total provision made to date amounted to approximately 
In accordance with its accounting policies, the Group conducted a revaluation of its investment properties at the end of 2002 with the value of its investment properties decreasing from HK$17,752 million in 2001 to HK$16,565 million in 2002.
Earnings per share were HK56.71 cents, an increase of 64% over 2001 s HK34.50 cents.

The Directors recommend a final dividend of HK12 cents per share for 2002 (2001: HK12 cents) payable to shareholders whose names appear on the registers of members of the Company on Tuesday, 15 April 2003, with a scrip alternative to offer the right to shareholders to elect to receive such final dividend wholly or partly by allotment of new shares credited as fully paid in lieu of cash (the 2002 Final Scrip Dividend Scheme ). The final dividend is expected to be paid on Friday, 30 May 2003.
A circular containing details of the 2002 Final Scrip Dividend Scheme together with the relevant election form, where applicable, will be sent to each shareholder of the Company on or about Wednesday, 30 April 2003. The 2002 Final Scrip Dividend Scheme is conditional upon (1) the approval of the proposed final dividend at the Company s Annual General Meeting to be held on Tuesday, 15 April 2003; (2) the issue price of a new share to be issued pursuant thereto being not less than the nominal value of a share of the Company; and (3) the granting by the Listing Committee of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong of the listing of and permission to deal in the new shares to be issued 
An interim dividend of HK18 cents per share was paid during the year which together with the proposed final dividend of HK12 cents per share will make a total dividend of HK30 cents per share for the year ended 31 December 2002 (2001: HK32 cents per share).
O VERALL B USINESS R EVIEW The Group s turnover increased by 2% to HK$5,156 million (2001: HK$5,036 million) compared with 2001 whilst profit attributable to shareholders increased from HK$396 million in 2001 to HK$660 million in 2002, representing an increase of 67%.
During the year, an additional provision of HK$266 million was made in respect of the Constellation Cove project in Tai Po making total provisions for the project amounting to HK$626 million. Out of this total provision, HK$188 million was realised in 2002 in line with the sales of properties whilst HK$438 million of the provision still remained unutilised as at 31 December 2002. With respect to Ocean Pointe, an amount of HK$107 million was also realised during 2002 in line with the sales of the properties.
Together with the HK$420 million previously realised in 2001, HK$527 million out of the total HK$550 million provision made for the project have been utilised, leaving provisions of HK$23 million for the remaining unsold units in the project.
The Group has continued to maintain very strong recurring cashflows from its investment property portfolio in Hong Kong and in the PRC through maintaining high occupancies, thus ensuring continuing good recurrent rental income. The Logistics and Warehouse Division has also expanded outside the Asian region to Europe with the acquisition of a freight and logistics company in the United Kingdom.
Together with the improved performance of the infrastructure projects, particularly the increased cargos being handled by Chiwan Container Terminal and Asia Airfreight Terminal and the steady contributions from the various international investments, the profit attributable to shareholders has increased accordingly during the year under 
H ONG K ONG P ROPERTY D IVISION The Hong Kong Property Division recorded total turnover of HK$2,705 million (2001: HK$2,810 million) in 2002, representing 52% of the total turnover for the Group. Rental income for the year amounted to HK$373 million, a decrease of 12% compared with HK$423 million for 2001. The decrease was mainly due to the disposal of Energy Plaza in July 2001 and revisions in rental rates.
Proceeds from sales of properties for the year ended 31 December 2002 amounted to HK$2,332 million (2001: HK$2,387 million). The loss attributable to the Group from the division amounted to approximately HK$24 million (2001: HK$224 million) after taking into account the Group s 75% share of the additional provision made for Constellation Cove amounting to approximately HK$200 million. In addition, as a result of the additional specific provision, the breakeven prices of the apartments, duplex villas and detached houses in Constellation Cove have dropped from HK$3,750 per square foot ( psf ) to HK$3,400 psf, HK$4,400 psf to HK3,800 psf and HK$4,750 psf to HK$4,200 psf, respectively.
Sales of Properties Sales activities in Hong Kong have continued to be strong during 2002. Sales revenue was derived mainly from the launch of Jupiter Terrace and Constellation Cove during the year, as well as the ongoing sales of Ocean Pointe and Enterprise Square 2.

The recent opening up of the Shenzhen border to operate on a twenty four hour basis has also made the development more attractive due to its central location between the border and the city, resulting in 3 apartments, 1 duplex villa and 5 detached houses being sold subsequent to the year 
The Group also launched the presales of its 50% owned joint venture residential development, The Cliveden in Tsuen Wan, in November 2002. The construction of The Cliveden is progressing according to schedule. As at 31 December 2002, approximately 31% of the development, comprising of 210 units, was presold.

The warehousing business in Hong Kong has been facing one of the toughest times seen in decades during 2002 with the demand for warehouse space in Hong Kong continuing to decrease. The division has been approaching this adverse market condition by implementing effective strategies to secure both cargo volume as well as tenants by taking a proactive approach and a continuous improvement in service quality. As a result, there was only a 6% reduction in turnover generated from the division s warehousing business versus a decrease in market rental of over 20% in 2002. The occupancy rate for the entire warehouse portfolio operated by the division stood at 92% as at 31 December 2002.

Efforts will be made to further develop other logistics business in this area when the opportunity 
With its global freight forwarding network gradually coming online, the division has achieved a significant increase in cargo volume handled during the year in Hong Kong. The increase in throughput has enabled the division to charter two 747 freighters for the first time in November 2002 flying to the United States.
The port closure in the United States west coast in October 2002 has also generated extra business for the division as cargos must be dispatched by air in order to meet pre-Christmas orders. The division will continue to expand its air and ocean freight business in order to enhance its bargaining power to obtain better rates and to secure space for its customers 
In addition, the division has managed to secure a variety of integrated logistics accounts covering industry chemical products, FMCG (fast moving consumer goods), consumer electronics, high value consumer products as well as food and beverages during the year.

In April 2002, the division successfully established its first logistics foothold in Europe with the acquisition of a 91% stake in Trident International Limited ( Trident ). Trident is one of the leading players in the Asia-United Kingdom trade and has built up a comprehensive range of logistics services in the United Kingdom. This acquisition has brought about material synergy to the division s freight business in Asia, especially in the PRC and Hong Kong. In February 2003, Trident was renamed as Kerry Logistics (UK) Limited and will operate under the trade name of Kerry Logistics.
The division has also formed a joint venture with a German-based logistics operator, Rhenus AG & Co.
KG ( Rhenus ) in January 2003 for joint marketing in Europe and Asia. Under this co-operation, Kerry Logistics Network will be Rhenus s preferred partner for contract logistics projects in Asia and vice versa.

I NFRASTRUCTURE D IVISION Profit attributable to the Group from the division amounted to approximately HK$101 million for the year ended 31 December 2002 (2001: HK$217 million). The significant drop in profits from the division was mainly due to the profits on disposal of the Hu-Ning Expressway being booked in December 2001 whilst the performances of the other infrastructure investments have actually improved during the year.
The operations of Chiwan Container Terminal are continuing to make good progress with its third berth making a full year contribution in 2002. 1,173,595 TEUs were handled during the year, representing an increase of 82% over 2001.

During the year, the Group continued to maintain most of its borrowings on an unsecured basis. As at 31 December 2002, unsecured debt comprised approximately 91% of total borrowings while total net borrowings amounted to approximately HK$5,633 million, resulting in a gearing ratio of approximately 27% based on shareholders equity of approximately HK$21 billion.

C ONTINGENT L IABILITIES The Group had provided guarantees for banking and other facilities granted to associated companies and investee companies and guarantees to certain banks for mortgage facilities granted to first buyers of certain properties in the PRC.

Practice Note 19 of the Listing Rules requires the disclosure of financial assistance and guarantees provided by the Group to affiliated companies and the specific performance obligations on controlling shareholders of the Company. The circumstances requiring disclosure by the Company of such financial assistance and guarantee have not been present since 31 December 1999 and this is still the case as at the year end. In addition, at the year end, the Group did not have any loan agreements with covenants which impose specific performance obligations on the controlling shareholders. The Directors, in accordance with the recommendation of the Audit Committee of the Board, consider that in the interest of good corporate governance and disclosure, the Company continues to make such disclosures. Full details of such disclosures can be found in the Report of the Directors in the Company s 2002 Annual 
E NVIRONMENTAL P ROTECTION I NITIATIVES The Group has continued with its initiatives to incorporate environmental protection measures in its projects. Starting from the design of the properties to the selection of materials and equipments, enhancement of the environment is achieved through well planned landscaping and the introduction of a Green Property Management System . Environmental protection measures such as waste management and recycling have been incorporated into the Group s three newest developments in Hong Kong, namely Branksome II, The Cliveden and Enterprise Square 3.
The designs in The Cliveden have also taken into account units with balconies to allow maximum light 
Likewise, the Group has also strived to roll out this environmental protection concept into its developments in the PRC and overseas. As evidenced by the design of Arcadia Court in Futian district in Shenzhen, in the PRC, 65% of the site area is reserved for extensive greenery landscaping. Over 1,500 trees are to be planted with floral and foliages blooming in different seasons. In the Philippines, The Enterprise Center in Manila received an award for its Energy Conservation Program at the 3rd Annual ASEAN Energy Awards held in Brunei in July 2002. Final judging revealed that The Enterprise Center was the most energy efficient building in the Philippines and the fifth most energy efficient building in the whole ASEAN region.
Going forward, the Group will continue to explore the possibility of incorporating more environmental protection measures implemented in its future developments where appropriate.

The global economy continues to be weak with the United States ( US ) market still taking time to recover.
Investors confidence has been affected by corporate accounting issues in the US and the possibility of an impending war in the Middle East. The Hong Kong economy, which closely follows the US market, is still affected and continues to be uncertain.
Despite these unfavourable factors, the Group is confident in the long term prospects of the property markets in Hong Kong and in the PRC. Historic low interest rates has made purchasing property extremely affordable which together with recent government measures, continue to underpin the demand for quality housing in Hong Kong. In the PRC, demand for quality housing also continues to increase as a result of improved living standards. The opening up of the Shenzhen border to operate on a twenty four hour basis will also have an encouraging effect on the Shenzhen property market.
In order to take advantage of the current market situation, the Group has taken steps to replenish its quality land banks both in Hong Kong and in the PRC. With the Group s established presence in the Hong Kong luxury residential market and its strong foothold in major cities in the PRC such as Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, the Group is in an excellent position to access further opportunities when they arise. The Group s healthy and growing recurrent income base and its strong financial standing will also equip the Group to face the challenges ahead.
With all these sound fundamentals, the Group is confident that it is in a very strong position to expand and grow in the coming years.
