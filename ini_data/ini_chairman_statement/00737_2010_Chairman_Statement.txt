Chairman s Statement In view of the rapid urbanization, fast growing economic and transportation of the western bank of the PRD, the Group believes that the Western Delta Route will serve as a platform for the long-term growth of its toll 
I am pleased to report the results of Hopewell Highway Infrastructure Limited and its subsidiaries (the Group ) for the year ended 30 June 2010. The Group s net toll revenue increased by 7% to HK$1,940 million as compared to last year. Profit attributable to owners of the Company decreased by 10% from HK$1,059 million of last year to HK$956 million.
This slip in profit was mainly attributable to the drop in interest income from bank deposits coupled with the significant step-up of the applicable PRC Enterprise Income Tax rate from year 2010 onwards. The basic earnings per share for the year decreased by 10% from last year s HK35.72 cents per share to HK32.28 cents.
During the year under review, the strong growth in private car ownership resulted from the increasing purchasing power in Guangdong led to a strong traffic and toll revenue growth of Class 1 small cars on GS Superhighway and Phase I West. In respect of GS Superhighway, both traffic and toll revenue from Class 1 small cars reached a record high level, while that from Classes 4 and 5 commercial vehicles (mainly trucks) strongly rebounded from the trough in early 2009. GS Superhighway and Phase I West continued to provide stable recurring profit and cash inflow to 
Phase II West opened on 25 June 2010 as scheduled, creating synergy with Phase I West and increasing the Group s total length of operating toll expressways to around 180 km. Phase I West and Phase II West, with a combined length of about 61 km, altogether form a major expressway linking Guangzhou with downtown Zhongshan. The travelling time between Guangzhou and Zhongshan has been greatly shortened from over an hour to approximately 30 minutes. The construction of Phase III West commenced in December 2009. It is planned to be completed and operational by the end of 2013.
In April 2010, the West Route JV signed a RMB3,930 million 18-year syndicated project loan for Phase III West with a group of seven banks of the PRC. Further, the Company took the honour as the first non-financial institution to issue RMB corporate bonds in Hong Kong in July 2010. The bond offering was well received by the market with 13 applications from institutional investors and a total subscription of RMB2.19 billion, achieving 2.19 times of the RMB1 billion target issue size. In response to the overwhelming market demand, the Company decided to increase the issue size to RMB1.38 billion. Some of the funds so raised will be used as capital injection in Phase III West, for which approval has been obtained from the relevant PRC authorities. It is currently planned that further capital injection in RMB for Phase III West will take place in the fourth quarter of 2010, following the first capital injection in RMB for this project which was made in June 2010. Such bond issue marked a milestone for the internationalization of RMB. The Group, with diversified financing sources and solid recurring income base, will continue to seek investment opportunities in the PRD and beyond to deliver steady and attractive returns to shareholders.

In view of the strong financial position of the Group, the Board has recommended a final dividend of HK15 cents per share. Together with the interim dividend of HK17 cents per share already paid, total dividend for the full year will be HK32 cents per share, a 9% decrease as compared to HK35 cents (not including the extraordinary special dividend of HK84 cents) for the last financial year. These represent a payout ratio of 99% on profit attributable to owners of the Company. Subject to the approval of the shareholders at the forthcoming annual general meeting to be held on 20 October 2010, the proposed final dividend will be paid on 21 October 2010 to shareholders as registered at the close of business on 20 October 2010. The Group will adhere to a 100% dividend payout policy, taking into account the steady earnings and cash flow as well as the healthy balance sheet and cash surplus on hand.
Closure of Register The Register of Members of the Company will be closed from Wednesday, 13 October 2010 to Wednesday, 20 October 2010, both days inclusive, during that period no transfer of shares of the Company will be effected. In order to qualify for the proposed final dividend, all transfers accompanied by the relevant share certificates must be lodged with the Company s Hong Kong Share Registrar, Computershare Hong Kong Investor Services Limited, at Shops 1712-1716, 17th Floor, Hopewell Centre, 183 Queen s Road East, Wanchai, Hong Kong not later than 4:30 p.m. on Tuesday, 12 
The Group maintained a strong financial position throughout the year. The Group s proportionately shared net toll revenue for the year ended 30 June 2010 increased by 7% from HK$1,809 million to HK$1,940 million.

As at 30 June 2010, the Group s Hong Kong headquarters (not including the PRC joint venture companies) had net cash on hand of HK$2,475 million, which would be more than sufficient for the equity injections required for Phase II West and Phase III West. Allowing for the equities required for Phase II West and Phase III West, the Company would still have a surplus cash of HK$1,114 million. Interest income for the year dropped owing to the low bank deposits interest rates and the decrease in cash balance.

The Group maintained a strong financial position throughout the year. The Group s proportionately shared net toll revenue for the year ended 30 June 2010 increased by 7% from HK$1,809 million to HK$1,940 million.

When expressed in terms of project interest coverage, being defined as the ratio of the Group s proportionately shared project EBITDA for the year ended 30 June 2010 to the corresponding project interest expenses, it would be about 23 times. In addition, the Group s syndicated bank loan facility of HK$3.6 billion remains undrawn. Net current assets as at 30 June 2010 amounted to HK$1,089 million, representing a 50% decrease against the HK$2,182 million as at the last financial year end mainly due to the increase in accruals for the construction cost of Phase II West and short-term bridging borrowings for the construction payments of Phase III West during the year.
The cash inflow of the Group is mainly derived from the dividends distributed by GS Superhighway JV and West Route JV in respect of Phase I West. The Group s regular dividend payout has been sufficiently covered by such cash inflow. Since April 2010, the Group has been able to remit its dividends from GS Superhighway JV and West Route JV to Hong Kong directly in RMB, without having them firstly converted into HK or US Dollars.
The Group was also approved by the relevant authorities in the PRC to inject its equity to Phase III West in RMB in June 2010. As of 30 June 2010, about 12% of the Group s total cash balance was denominated in RMB amounting to RMB258 million. The Group plans to keep most of its cash balance in RMB in the future, which is in line with its policy to adopt RMB as its functional currency. Moreover, the Group will continue to reinforce its treasury management and evaluate available options with a view to improving the yields of its ample cash deposits portfolio.
Business Review and Outlook The world economic environment remained quite volatile during the year under review. While the impact of the global financial tsunami gradually subsided in the second half of 2009, the downgrading of the sovereign debts of certain European Union member states in the first half of 2010 created uncertainties in the world s financial markets and threatened to jeopardise the global economy recovery.
Despite the global economic uncertainties, the PRC government s stimulus measures caused the country s GDP growth rate above 10% during the first and second quarters of 2010. Both imports and exports continued to rebound, and the car manufacturing and sales sectors benefited from the stimulus policies. The number of car owners in the PRC has risen rapidly, and their greater geographical mobility has led to a resurgence of the transportation industry in the PRD. The volume of road users, especially private car, has likewise grown sharply. While there are measures, implicit or explicit, to cool down the property market in the PRC, the domestic consumption market is resilient. Generally speaking, the Group s expressways benefitted from the fast-paced economic recovery and development in the PRD in the past year.
During the year, robust traffic growth in Class 1 small cars was recorded on our expressway projects. The average daily toll revenue of GS Superhighway was close to its historical high in 2007. In order to relieve traffic pressure and sustain smooth traffic for certain busy road sections of GS Superhighway, the GS Superhighway JV plans to commence widening works on these sections prior to the completion of the feasibility study on widening the entire GS Superhighway to ten lanes in dual directions. The busier 3.5 km road section between Wudianmei and Taiping interchange is being widened to a section with a total of ten lanes in dual directions. The widening works are planned to be completed in the third quarter of 2011.
This will relieve the traffic pressure and congestion collectively built up by Hugang Expressway, Humen Bridge and GS Superhighway during certain periods of the day and help maintain a smooth flow of traffic all along GS Superhighway. With its strategic location and connection with the highway network well established over the past decade, GS Superhighway will continue to be the main artery within the region.
The strong economic growth of Foshan city, partly attributed to the urban economic integration and cooperation with Guangzhou, fosters the traffic growth of Phase I West and Phase II West. Both the average daily traffic and revenue of Phase I West achieved historical high levels during the financial year. The Group believes that the opening of Phase II West in June 2010 will create synergy and support further growth in traffic and revenue of Phase I West. After Phase II West opened, the average daily traffic volume and toll revenue of Phase I West in July 2010 rose 21% and 17% respectively compared to June 2010. Moreover, the average daily toll revenue of Phase II West has already exceeded RMB600,000 towards the end of August 2010, getting closer to the Group s target for cash flow breakeven of RMB800,000.
The construction of Phase III West has commenced in December 2009 with currently planned completion by the end of 2013. Upon completion of Phase III West, the total length of toll expressways invested by the Group will be further expanded by about 20% to around 220 km. In view of the rapid urbanization, fast growing economic and transportation of the western bank of the PRD, the Group believes that the Western Delta Route will serve as a platform for the long-term growth of its toll road business.
The PRD Reform and Development Plan (2008-2020) promulgated by the National Development and Reform Commission in December 2008 pledges to enhance the integration, optimisation and acceleration of economic development on the western bank of the PRD, and the State Council also approved the overall development plan for Hengqin on 14 August 2009.
Hengqin, which is adjacent to Macau, has been designated as a State-level Strategic New Zone, and a central financial and business district will be built there to accelerate its development. Furthermore, construction of the HZM Bridge started on 15 December 2009, and it is expected to be completed and operational in 2015. Vehicles will then be able to travel to and from cities on the western bank of the PRD along the Western Delta Route and via the HZM Bridge to Hong Kong. Apart from the advantages created by the expansion and completion of the regional expressway network, HZM Bridge will create synergy with the Western Delta Route, thereby benefiting the Group s projects. The Group believes that the Western Delta Route will also benefit from the integration of the economies and transportation networks of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau in the future.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank my fellow directors, management team, and all staff for their hard work, dedication and commitment in the past year. I would also like to thank all our shareholders, financiers and business partners for their continuous support and confidence in the Group which have contributed towards the Group s success last year.
