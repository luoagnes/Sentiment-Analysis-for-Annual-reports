Chairman s Statement and Management Discussion and Analysis 
For the year ended 31 December 2003, the Group s turnover was approximately HK$90 million, representing a decrease of 20.2% as compared to HK$112.8 million in last year. Such decrease was mainly due to the cessation of computer business and the detrimental effect of the SARS to the watch business whereas the gradual recovery after SARS was not fully reflected on the year end date. The Group s loss attributable to shareholders was approximately HK$144,000 for the year, representing a decrease of 99% as compared with HK$25.5 million of last year and the loss per share for the year was HK$0.003 cents (2002: HK$0.740 cents). The decrease in loss attributable to shareholders for the year was mainly due to the stringent cost control on the production costs as well as the administrative and other operating expenses.

The Board of Directors have resolved not to recommend any dividend for the financial year ended 31 December 2003 (2002: Nil).

The past financial year was a challenging year for the Group, given the turbulent situation in Middle East and the outbreak of SARS. The Group has been struggling to minimise the adverse impact on the business of the Group while focusing on the internal control and management, and streamlining the manufacturing process and operations to increase effectiveness and efficiency and lower the costs of production.
The global economy has indeed shown sign of recovery; Hong Kong s economic also rebound after the SARS, and the PRC economic is forecasted to continue to grow. To prepare for the revival of the economy and the upcoming new investments opportunities, a capital reorganisation ( Capital Reorganisation ) was proposed and was subsequently completed on 7 April 2004.
The Capital Reorganisation changed the capital structure of the Company which allows flexibility to facilitate any future capital raising when circumstances arise. Moreover, in order to strengthen the Group s financial position for the upcoming opportunities, a subscription agreement was entered between Perfect View Development Limited ( Perfect View ) and the Company on 24 December 2003 to subscribe 5,000,000,000 new shares of the Company ( Subscription ) which was also completed on 13 April 2004.

BUSINESS REVIEW (continued) Manufacturing and selling of watches and watches components For the year ended 31 December 2003, the Group s income derived from the manufacturing and sale of watches and watch components was approximately HK$85.3 million, which was equivalent to 94.7% of the Group s total turnover, representing a decrease of 17.5% compared with the turnover of manufacturing and sale of watches and watch components of approximately HK$103.4 million for the last year. The profit made was approximately HK$3.3 million and a loss of HK$16 million was incurred in last year. The turnaround profit was mainly due to the stringent costs control in streamlining the production processes which lower the production costs and improve the margin, whilst sales and marketing related direct expenditures were also reduced.
Hong Kong, Middle East and South America are still the Group s primary markets, of which turnover of South America continue to grow, as a result of the extensive marketing effort, accounting for 44.6% of the Group s total turnover, and recorded a turnover of HK$40.1 million, representing an increase of 26.9% over the last year (2002: HK$31.6 million).
While Middle East sales was suffered from the turbulent situation, the sales of Hong Kong and the PRC region were also affected by the detrimental effect of the SARS. Turnover reduced by 55% from HK$35.6 million last year to HK$15.9 million this year. While the gradual recovery from SARS was yet to be reflected in the current financial year, the Board anticipate that the signing of the CEPA and the China accession to WTO will provide edge to the watch business in the PRC, and the Board believe business in the PRC will become more significant to the development of the Group.
In view of that, further resources will be put into the development of the PRC market as well as exploration of new overseas markets.

As at 31 December 2003, the Group employed a total workforce of approximately 2,000 people (2002: 2,100) among which 30 people (2002: 30) were working in Hong Kong. The staff costs for the year amounted to approximately HK$25.6 million (2002: HK$29.2 million). The employees remuneration, promotion and salary increment are assessed based on their work performance, working and professional experiences and the prevailing market practice.
Pledge of Assets The Group s leasehold land and buildings in the PRC with a market value of approximately HK$21.5 million (2002: HK$20.1 million) were pledged to a bank for banking facilities granted to the Group amounted to approximately HK$12 million (2002: HK$12.2 million).

As at 31 December 2003, the Group had no material contingent liability.

BUSINESS REVIEW (continued) Foreign exchange and interest rate exposure As the Group s sales are mostly based on United States dollar ( USD ), having considered the exchange rate of USD is fairly stable, no foreign exchange and interest rate risk management or related hedges were made at present. Proper policy will be in place when the Board considers 
On 22 May 2002, Synnex Canada Limited ( Synnex ), a supplier of 1024120 Ontario Limited ( Ontario ), a disposed subsidiary of the Company, has issued a writ against the Company for trade debt of CAD$466,472 (equivalent approximately to HK$2,320,000) due by Ontario. As stated in the statement of claim, the Company has given a cross-corporate guarantee on 16 August 2001 in favour of Synnex for facilities granted to Ontario and since Ontario had defaulted in repayment of its debt, the Company, being the guarantor of the said facilities, were demanded to pay and settle the said debt. However, the Company has never given such guarantee. The Company has taken legal action to clarify the case, and the Company was advised by its legal adviser and the Canada legal representative that evidentially the guarantee is fake and the guarantee documents are incomplete, therefore a motion of dismiss is proposed and yet to be submitted to the court to strike off the case. As such, except the legal costs for the defence, no provision on the alleged guarantee was made in the accounts.
