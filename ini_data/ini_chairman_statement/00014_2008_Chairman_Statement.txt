Chairman s Statement 
While the global economy experienced overall growth in 2007, the second half of the year saw signifi cant slowdown in the United States economy, stemming from subprime debt issues. Hong Kong s economic fundamentals continued to be supported by domestic consumption and good employment conditions. The supply of Grade A offi ce units in core districts remained limited relative to the demand, leading to signifi cant rental increases.
In particular, rental trends in the central business district resulted in more tenants choosing to relocate to other core areas including Causeway Bay. Retail rents were again boosted by strong private consumption, while luxury residential rental demand remained high.

Overall 2007 turnover was HK$1,368 million, up 7.9% from 2006. If the element of Hennessy Centre (under redevelopment since late 2006) is excluded, the turnover increase would be 18.8%. Healthy growth was recorded in all sectors (Offi ce: 23.3%; Retail: 17.7%; Residential: 12.9%), with the offi ce sector growth due partly to the decentralisation factor.
Recurring Underlying Profi t, which is profi t excluding asset value changes and prior years tax provision, was HK$950 million, up 25.8% from HK$755 million in 2006. Earnings per share, based on Recurring Underlying Profi t, rose to HK90.32 cents (2006: HK71.60 cents).
Underlying Profi t, excluding unrealised revaluation changes on investment properties and related deferred tax, was HK$1,158 million (2006: HK$1,012 million).
Statutory Profi t increased 27.4% to HK$3,949 million (2006: HK$3,099 million), due mainly to higher valuation of the Group s investment 
The external valuation of the Group s investment property portfolio increased to HK$35,711 million, a rise of 10.0% from HK$32,473 million in 2006. Adjusted shareholders funds went up by 14.1% to HK$35,072 million.
The Board recommends the payment of a fi nal dividend of HK48.0 cents per share (2006: HK40.0 cents). Together with the interim dividend of HK12.0 cents per share (2006: HK10.0 cents), there is an aggregate distribution of HK60.0 cents per share, representing a year-on-year increase of 20.0%.
Subject to shareholder approval, the fi nal dividend will be payable in cash with a scrip 
OUR GUIDING VALUES I believe a company s corporate culture and values play a very important role in its success.
They defi ne the way it does things, and ensure that all staff pursue a common goal.
Hysan takes pride in our corporate culture underpinning our aim to be a successful as well as responsible business. Our Guiding Values is the theme of this year s annual report. I trust it will give readers a better understanding of the values that underpin our achievements.
DIRECTORS AND STAFF I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere thanks to Per Jorgensen, who stepped down as an Independent non- executive Director after serving the Board for 26 years. I would also like to thank Michael Lee, who stepped down as the Managing Director, for his contribution to the Group. I welcome Tom Behrens-Sorensen, our new Independent non-executive Director, who joined us in May.
Finally, I also thank all staff members for their dedication and hard work throughout the year.

Hong Kong s economic fundamentals remain sound, underpinned by solid domestic demand and employment conditions. Challenges, however, include the risk of further slowdown in the U.S. economy and in Europe.
We are cautiously optimistic about the year ahead. Signifi cant price differential for Grade A offi ces between central business district and other core areas, together with limited new supply in such districts, should continue to benefi t our property investment portfolio situated in the prime Causeway Bay district.
