Chairman s Statement During 2007 we took advantage of the buoyant economic conditions in Hong Kong and the region to achieve highly satisfactory income growth in our various business segments.
The Group s underlying core income for the full year of 2007 increased to HK$896.4 million, 36.5% higher than that of HK$657.0 million for 2006. In fact, the 2007 income has not taken into account the fi nal distribution declared by Champion REIT because of an accounting timing technicality.
Otherwise the HK$124.9 million of distribution attributable to the Group would have brought our 2007 core earnings to HK$1,021.3 million, a 55.5% growth over the comparative fi gure for the prior year.
Due to strong demand from the fi nancial and service sectors, the offi ce market in Hong Kong went from strength to strength. At the end of 2007 all our offi ce buildings in Hong Kong were virtually full. Rent rates also surged during the year. The Langham Place Mall has essentially completed its major tenant mix realignment initiative as 2007 came to a close. With a consistent growth in footfall over the past two years, the Mall has attracted a large number of high-quality and popular retailers, which in turn have attracted more shoppers.
The Hotels Division delivered highly satisfactory fi nancial results in 2007 with an overall EBITDA growth of 15% year on year, driven mainly by our hotels in Hong Kong and the southern hemisphere. In the mean time we have also made signifi cant progress in our efforts to build the Langham brand of luxury hotels. We have contracted to buy one more fi ve-star hotel in California and signed up several management contracts on luxury hotels in China and Thailand. Sophisticated management and reservation system infrastructures are now in place, ready to take the Langham brand to another level of 
Our 48.5% holding of units in Champion REIT started to contribute income in 2007 as our distribution waiver in favour of the independent unitholders was scaled back from 100% for 2006 to 55% in 2007. Benefi ting at the same time from an exceptionally strong Central offi ce leasing market, the REIT has reported an increase in Net Property Income on an annualized basis by 58.6% to HK$680 million for 2007.
A conditional agreement was signed on 14 February 2008 for Great Eagle to inject the retail mall and offi ce tower of Langham Place, representing a total gross fl oor area of approximately 1,300,000 sq. ft., into Champion REIT at an implied price of HK$12.5 billion, representing a discount of 11.8% to the properties appraised value of HK$14.2 billion as of 30 November 2007. The consideration is expected to be satisfi ed with a combination of new placement units of Champion REIT, cash and assumption of debts. Completion of the transaction will be subject to successful fund- raising by Champion REIT on or before the end of June 2008. After the transaction is consummated, Champion will have diversifi ed its asset and income bases from a pure Central fi nancial market exposure with the prime retail asset and the trading and services offi ce tenant base of Langham Place. In conjunction with the asset purchase, Champion REIT will also unwind the fi nancial engineering features currently in its income structure. The enlarged and diversifi ed asset base and the enhanced fi nancial transparency should lead to higher investment ratings for Champion. That would be benefi cial to Great Eagle, which intends to maintain its interest in Champion at the current substantial level of

During 2007, we continued to focus our promotional strategy and resources on several highly popular major events to reinforce the original, creative and trendy image of the Mall. The substantial overhaul and enhancement of its trade-mix have increased its attraction to shoppers. As a result, footfall at the Mall rose 28% year on year. The average sales per sq. ft.
of the tenants also benefi ted from strong consumption growth in Hong Kong, posting a better than market 18.6% increase year on year. Occupancy at the Mall was 96.6% as of 31 December 2007, moderately higher than that of 95.1% at the previous year-end. However due to substantial downtime in between leases while the tenant-mix make-over was in progress, as well as higher interim vacancies while shops were merged to create anchor spaces, the rental income HK$251.4 million for 2007 was almost fl at from the HK$259.2 million for 2006. As the tenant realignment exercise has been substantially completed in 2007 and with the benefi t of the presence of two major anchor tenants which opened in late 2007, we expect solid growth in tenants sales and hence our rental income for 2008.
We had aggressively leased up the Offi ce tower in the fi rst half of 2007 and it was virtually fully occupied at 99.6% as of 31 December 2007 as compared with 74.8% at the beginning of the year. Rental income increased signifi cantly by 202% to HK$100.5 million for 2007 from HK$33.3 million for 2006 largely because of the increased occupancy and corresponding reduction in vacancy costs.
Langham Place Offi ce Tower and Mall together contributed in 2007 approximately HK$512.6 million and HK$362.4 million respectively to the Group s revenue and net property income, before adjusting for intra- 
Great Eagle Centre Due to the lack of new supply in the WanchaiCauseway Bay areas and robust demand from the trading and services segments, Great Eagle Centre was very well occupied throughout 2007. As at 31 December 2007, the occupancy of the offi ce portion was 99.3%, which was 3.3% higher than that at year-end 2006. The retail area also remained 100% leased throughout. With very low vacancy rates, we were able to progressively raise rents as tenancies were rolled over through the year.
The rental income of Great Eagle Centre as a result rose 28.8% from HK$60.1 million for 2006 to HK$77.4 million 
Eaton House Serviced Apartments All three serviced apartment buildings performed well during the year, benefi ting from an active local corporate market. Completion of room refurbishments at the Blue Pool Road property in April 2007 helped to lift overall occupancy and average rates. Average occupancy for the three properties improved to 84.5% for 2007 as compared to 73.9% for the prior year. Rental income correspondingly increased to HK$24.3 million from HK$18.9 million, a 28.7% increase.
Convention Plaza Apartments As at 31 December 2007, the properties were 100% occupied. Due to the strength of the luxurious residential market, rents generally increased on reversion.
Downtime in between leases was also reduced. Rental income of 2007 improved to HK$2.9 million from that of HK$2.3 million for 2006.
Eaton Hotel Banquet & Convention Centre All the four shops in the Centre were let as of 31 December 2007. Rental income of 2007 reached HK$3.0 million (2006: HK$2.6 million).

The overall real estate market in California witnessed favorable growth in rental rates and occupancy in 2007. However, this improvement in market conditions was not refl ected in the performance of our properties because of signifi cant tenant turnovers coupled with negative rental reversion at 353 Sacramento Street, 150 Spear Street and 500 Ygnacio. 2700 Ygnacio on the other hand improved its contribution due to higher occupancy and lower tenant improvement costs. Total rental income from the California portfolio dropped to HK$34.0 million in 2007 from HK$53.8 million in 2006.
However it is noteworthy that the rental income for the second half of 2007 amounted to HK$28.8 million, a substantial increase over that of HK$5.2 million for the fi rst half of 2007. It is evident that the portfolio has seen its worst and should show positive income growth in the 
The 150 Spear Street property was sold for HK$1,111.8 million in December 2007, generating an after tax profi t of HK$223.1 million. The cash generated from the sale was reinvested by way of a like-kind exchange in January 2008 with the purchase of the Southern California landmark hotel previously known as the Ritz Carlton Huntington Hotel and Spa in Pasadena at a price equivalent to HK$1,287 million. The hotel is now a 
As Citibank Plaza had been spun off to Champion REIT in May 2006, no direct rental income was derived from that property for 2007, whereas HK$133.0 million of income was booked for the fi rst 5 months of 2006. In lieu of direct property income, Champion contributed a total of HK$210.8 million in income to the Group during 2007, notwithstanding the Group s waiver of 55% of its distribution entitlement for that year. Champion has reported a net property income of HK$680 million for 2007, an increase of 58.6% over that for the prior year period on an annualized basis. It should be noted that the Group s share of the fi nal distribution that has been declared by Champion for 2007 was not included in the income statement of Great Eagle for 2007 as distribution income from Champion is recognized upon distribution book closing date, which in this case occurred after the Group s fi nancial year-end. If the HK$124.9 million of distribution due from Champion were taken into account, the total income from Champion for 2007 would have been HK$335.7 million.

Our hotels portfolio showed a positive general improvement in overall results with total revenue of HK$2.9 billion, up 13% over 2006. The hotels in Hong Kong have taken advantage of the good economic and market conditions as well as the large number of trade fairs to improving their share of business travellers.

The Hotels Division continues to seek out opportunities to strengthen its presence in key global markets on a number of fronts. It continued its expansion momentum in Asia-Pacifi c by entering into several management agreements in China and Thailand. Also, the acquisition of the 392-room Langham Huntington Hotel and Spa, Pasadena, California in January 2008, will assist in growing our brand awareness in North America.
HONG KONG OPERATIONS Langham Hotel, Hong Kong Improved results were recorded for the year as the hotel benefi ted from targeting the high-yield corporate market with a resultant increase in average room rates. However, its revenue was impacted by the room refurbishment program in the third quarter of the year.
The second phase of the three year room-renovation programme in the coming year will provide a luxury quality product that will rank with the best in Hong Kong and continue to position the hotel at the high end of the 5-star hotel market.
For the year 2007, the hotel achieved an average occupancy of 87% (2006: 87%) and average room rate of HK$1,516 (2006: HK$1,318).
Langham Place Hotel, Hong Kong This modern 5-star hotel delivered an impressive performance for the year with total revenue continuing to achieve double-digit growth and revenue per available room increasing 19% year-on-year, driven mainly by higher room rates. Food and beverage business also posted strong results with a good mix of corporate events and catering functions, particularly wedding banquets. A new Japanese restaurant was opened in December 2007. The hotel will continue to focus on building its share of the retail and corporate FIT market.
Its food and beverage operations will emphasis on capitalising on its position as a well-established venue for wedding functions.
For the year 2007, the hotel achieved an average occupancy of 89% (2006: 86%) and average room rate of HK$1,297 (2006: HK$1,119).
Eaton Hotel, Hong Kong The Eaton Hotel posted strong results for the year as it benefi ted from its phased room renovation and from targeting the retail market. Average room rates for 2007 rose 15% over the previous year. Its restaurant business enjoyed sustained growth, especially in the catering department with a healthy mix of corporate meetings, conferences and wedding functions. The ongoing room refurbishment will place the hotel at the high end of the four star market with enhanced guest facilities. A new Japanese restaurant was opened in December.
For the year 2007, the hotel achieved an average occupancy of 90% (2006: 88%) and average room rate of HK$857 (2006: HK$744).

Langham Hotel, London The renovation of the signature restaurant and other food and beverage outlets was completed in 2007.
The major extent of the works had limited the REVPAR growth for the year. The main phase of the renovation project for the guestrooms and public area will be undertaken over the coming year with the aim to positioning the hotel at the very top end of the luxury 5-star hotel market and reinforce its position as the Group s fl agship hotel. However, while this is going on, we would expect the hotel s income performance in 2008 to be materially affected.
For the year 2007, the hotel achieved an average occupancy of 72% (2006: 75%) and average room rate of 188 (2006: 178).
Langham Hotel, Boston The hotel ended 2007 on a positive note supported by a number of citywide events, attracting business travellers, which lifted revenue per available room by 9% over the prior year. The last phase of the bedroom refurbishment programme, and the opening of the new spa facility which will be completed by May 2008, will provide an enhanced quality experience for guests.
For the year 2007, the hotel achieved an average occupancy of 74% (2006: 75%) and average room rate of US$249 (2006: US$226).
Langham Hotel, Melbourne 2007 was a good year for the hotel with strong revenue growth, due to a combination of an increase of business travellers, major events and robust economic market conditions.

The revenue generated from property management activities for 2007 amounted to HK$19.6 million, which was 4.2% higher than that of 2006. Engineering revenue for 2007 was HK$35.5 million, an increase of 56.0% over 2006 refl ecting higher leasing activities at the Group s offi ce buildings and hence more renovation jobs. Fire services contracting services also contributed to the income growth.

Our gross debts denominated in HK dollars amounted to HK$6,144 million as of 31 December 2007, all of which was on fl oating rate basis. Our foreign currency gross debts as of 31 December 2007 amounted to the equivalent of HK$3,241 million, of which the equivalent of HK$686 million, or 21% of our foreign currency debts, was on fi xed-rate basis. The consolidated Net Attributable Debt outstanding (net of cash and bank deposits) as of 31 December 2007 was HK$5,610 million, a decrease of HK$1,444 million from that of HK$7,054 million as of 31 December 2006. Equity Attributable to Shareholders, based on valuation of the Group s investment properties as of 31 December 2007 and the depreciated historical costs of the Group s hotel properties, amounted to HK$25,081 million as of 31 December 2007. The resulting gearing ratio at 31 December 2007 was 22%.

The net fi nance cost of HK$421.6 million incurred in 2007 decreased by HK$114.3 million from the HK$535.9 million for the prior year as a result of the reduction in borrowings after receipt of the proceeds from the Champion REIT IPO.
Overall interest cover for 2007 was 3.54 times, as compared to that of 2.47 times for 2006.
Liquidity and Debt Maturity Profi le As of 31 December 2007, our cash, bank deposits and committed but undrawn loan facilities amounted to a total of HK$5,889 million. The majority of our loan facilities is medium-term in nature and is secured by properties with suffi cient value to loan coverage.

As at 31 December 2007, the Group had authorised capital expenditures not provided for in the consolidated fi nancial statements amounting to approximately HK$166.7 million (2006: HK$86 million) of which approximately HK$166.1 million (2006: HK$85 million) were contracted for.
Other than set out above, the Group did not have any signifi cant commitments and contingent liabilities as at 31 December 2007.

The Group is well positioned for further growth in the coming year. As the passing rents of our rental properties in Hong Kong are well below current market rents, there will be considerable room for positive rental reversion as leases are rolled over. Our rental income should therefore continue to see good increases.
The offi ce towers of Langham Place and Great Eagle Centre are both virtually fully let and are well positioned to withstand competition from the new offi ce supplies in the Kowloon peripheral areas. The Langham Place Mall has been gaining popularity among shoppers, and the positive impact of two new anchor tenants has just started to show. There is considerable momentum in the sales performance of shop tenants. That should support good growth in rents at the Mall in 2008.
Our investment in Champion REIT will also be generating increasing income to the Group. Its underlying rental income should continue to go up quite signifi cantly as the full impact of rental reversions in 2007 will be refl ected in 2008. At the same time, the reduction of our distribution waiver in favour of the independent unitholders will give us a bigger share of Champion s growing income.
Our global hotel portfolio should show a steady overall performance in 2008. The Hong Kong business travel market appears to be quite solid and therefore should support some moderate growth in room rates. The ongoing major renovation at our London fl agship will have a major negative impact on its performance in the coming year. We have built up the necessary infrastructures to support further growth in our hotel management and ownership portfolio. And we will prudently seek out opportunities in the region, with a focus on major cities in China, and in particular mixed- use development projects anchored by a luxury hotel with residential andor commercial components.
There has seen considerable volatility in the global fi nancial markets in recent months. With the United States possibly sliding into recession in the coming quarters, the world economies will inevitably be affected to varying extents. We have positioned the Group to operate and compete effectively in this environment.
We have a very sound balance sheet with very low gearing. The vast majority of our assets are high quality properties in prime urban locations. And we have a strong recurrent income base that has more upside for growth. We maintain our confi dence on the long-term growth prospects of this region. With our strong liquidity position we will be looking out for strategic investments as and when market opportunities arise.

The total number of employees in the Group was 4,044 as at 31 December 2007.

The Board has resolved to recommend to Shareholders at the forthcoming 2008 Annual General Meeting (the 2008 AGM ) the payment of a fi nal dividend of HK35 cents per share for the year ended 31 December 2007 (2006: HK25 cents per share) to Shareholders whose names appear on the Register of Members on 23 May 2008. Together with the interim dividend of HK15 cents per share paid on 25 October 2007, the total dividend for the full year will be HK50 cents per share (2006: HK$5.3 per share, including a fi nal dividend of HK25 cents, an interim dividend of HK5 cents and a special interim dividend of HK$5), amounting to not less than HK$302,333,000 (2006: HK$3,184,535,000).
Shareholders will be given the option to receive the fi nal dividend in new shares in lieu of cash ( Scrip Dividend Arrangement ). The Scrip Dividend Arrangement is subject to: (1) the approval of proposed fi nal dividend at the 2008 AGM; and (2) The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited granting the listing of and permission to deal in the new shares to be issued pursuant thereto.
A circular containing details of the Scrip Dividend Arrangement will be despatched to Shareholders together with the form of election for scrip dividend soon after the 2008 AGM.
