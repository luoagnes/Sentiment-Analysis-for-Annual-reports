Chairman s Statements 
On behalf of Haitian International Holdings Limited, ( Haitian or the Company ), with its subsidiaries (together, the Group ), I am pleased to present the Group s annual results for the year ended 31 December 2011.

During the year ended 31 December 2011 ( Reported Period ), the global and domestic investment confidence was shaken by tight monetary policy in China, European sovereign debt crisis and worries about the progress of economic recovery in the United States.
Such events, which also affected the consumer confidence in different regions of the world together inevitably undermined the demand of capital goods including plastic injection moulding machines ( PIMMs ) and adversely affected the PIMMs industry.
Notwithstanding the unfavourable environment of the industry, we successfully withstood these macro challenges in 2011 through our efforts in continuing to introduce new and innovative products, expanding international markets, product development and efficiency improvement. We reported a close-to-record revenue of RMB7,027.6 million which represented a negligible drop of 0.4% and a record-setting profit of RMB1,103.6 million representing a mild growth of 3.9% for the Reported Period compared with the same period in 2010. The Board of Directors has declared a final dividend of HK$0.135 per share for the year ended 31 December 2011, bringing the total dividend for 2011 to HK$0.295 per share.
During the Reported Period, our domestic sales drop by 7.2% from RMB5,228.4 million in 2010 to RMB4,854.2 million and that was partially compensated by the export sales growth of 17.3% from RMB1,698.5 million in 2010 to RMB1,992.6 million in 2011. As a result, we achieved a similar record level sales of RMB7,027.6 million in 2011.
Domestic and export sales The Group s sales by geographic areas are summarized in the following table: (RMB million) 2011 % 2010 % 
Domestic Sales 4,854.2 69.1% 5,228.4 74.1% (7.2)% Export Sales 1,992.6 28.4% 1,698.5 24.1% 17.3% Parts (both domestic and export) 180.8 2.5% 130.4 1.8% 38.7% Total 7,027.6 100.0% 7,057.3 100.0% (0.4)% After the strong recovery of Chinese economy since the second quarter of 2009, our domestic sales had reported a record level of RMB5,228.4 million in 2010 resulting from market share gain and restoration of deferred CAPEX in view of the financial tsunami in 2008 and early 2009. Starting from 2011, the Chinese government implemented a number of tightening measures including lifting PBOC s reserve ratio and interest rates in order to curb the overheated economy, inflation and property prices. The impact of such tightening measures gradually emerged in the second half of 2011 and hampered the domestic machinery investment sentiment.
Our domestic sales in the second half of 2011 had recorded a drop of 16.0% compared with the first half of 2011. Nonetheless, benefiting from a diversified customer portfolio, especially for large corporate customers which generally have strong financial position and carefully-planned CAPEX schedule, our domestic sales is less impacted by the tightening measures than other industrial peers. Our full-year domestic sales had recorded a mild drop by 7.2% from RMB5,228.4 million in 2010 to RMB4,854.2 million in 2011. Despite the challenges in global economy presented by the European sovereign debt crisis and worries that the United States economy may falter, we continued to see outstanding performance in our export sales. Through the efforts of building international brand image, strengthening coverage in new markets and expanding export product, our export sales in the second half of 2011 had continued the momentum with the growth of 1.7% compared with the first half of 2011. Our full-year export sales had recorded an encouraging growth from RMB1,698.5 million in 2010 to RMB1,992.6 million in 2011. The sales mix in export sales increased from 24.1% in 2010 to 28.4% in 2011.
Small and medium-to-large tonnage sales The Group s sales by small and medium-to-large tonnage PIMMs are summarized in the following table: (RMB million) 2011 % 2010 % 
Small tonnage 4,346.6 61.9% 4,458.6 63.2% (2.5)% Medium-to-large tonnage sales 2,500.2 35.6% 2,468.3 35.0% 1.3% Parts 180.8 2.5% 130.4 1.8% 38.7% Total 7,027.6 100.0% 7,057.3 100.0% (0.4)% The medium-to-large tonnage PIMMs are usually employed by medium-to-large-size enterprises which generally have stronger financial position and carefully planned CAPEX. Therefore, the sales of medium-to-large machines were generally less sensitive to sluggish market environment and tightening of liquidity. Our sales of medium-to-large tonnage PIMMs still recorded a growth of 1.3% compared with the same period in 2010. In contrast, small tonnage PIMMs are generally more sensitive to macroeconomic changes. The strong growth in sales of all-electric PIMMs which are usually small tonnage PIMM has partly compensated the drop of sales in small tonnage hydraulic PIMMs. As a result, the sales of small tonnage PIMMs recorded a mild drop of 2.5% compared with the same period in 2010.
During the Reported Period, our total output dropped from approximately 30,000 units to 27,000 units of PIMMs while our average selling price increased from RMB229,000 in 2010 to RMB253,000 in 2011. The increase of average selling price reflects the increase in sales mix of medium-to-large tonnage PIMMs and the higher-value-added PIMMs. Despite the tough operating environment, a number of our technological advanced products still performed well in 2011. The sales of Mars series energy-saving PIMMs continued its growth and we recorded sales of RMB5,163.0 million in 2011 which represented a growth of 6.9% compared with 2010. The sales of Mars series PIMMs have increased its contribution to our total sales to 73.5% in 2011 from 68.4% in 2010. The sales of our Venus series all-electric PIMMs have been continuously accelerating after its launch and reached RMB305.2 million in 2011, representing a growth of 77.5% when compared with 2010. The high price-to-performance ratio of our Venus series all- electric PIMMs has received well recognition by customers. Our Venus series PIMMs are able to compete not only with overseas branded PIMMs imported to the PRC market but also globally with other brands in overseas market. In 2011, export sales of Venus series amounted to 152.0 million, representing 49.8% of Venus sales.
Enhancing customer benefits and innovation with sustainability are always on the top of our management s agenda. In 2011, we had made significant progress in our product innovation and R&D achievements. On 14 February 2012, our research and development projects of Research and development of plastic precision moulding technology and equipment and respective industrialisation and Research and development of key integrated digital design techniques for sophisticated machinery, process and tooling equipment and the related product series won two 2011 National Science and Technology Progress Awards (Second Prize). These two awards are the highest honours received in our history and also the first time similar awards were made to the PIMMs industry in 
As one of the highlights of our product development, our German-Chinese Zhafir team has successfully developed the fully electric, high-tech Mercury series with features which are pioneer in the international PIMM industry. By adopting a number of pioneer technologies, the Mercury series PIMMs can process complex and precision plastic components under extra-ordinary high-melt quality with maximum injection speed acceleration which makes new application of plastic materials possible. We also enhanced the strategic cooperation with Trexel Inc. to offer the MuCell system equipped Haitian PIMMs in China and certain designed areas internationally. Haitian has successfully worked with Trexel for joint development and offer of the Haitian Micro-Cellular Foaming ( MCF ) Injection Molding system. The MuCelltechnology can create many advantages in processing plastic parts. Through this technology, customers can best maintain the original mechanical properties and enhance quality of plastic parts, while reducing the manufacturing cost by using less plastic materials, shortening cycle time and reducing required clamping force of PIMMs. The addition of the MuCell offering will complete Haitian s total solution in micro- cellular foaming. These outstanding achievements of our development team further uplift our technological level to the same level of the international first class PIMM 
Looking ahead to 2012, the macro-environment remains volatile and complicated and will pose challenges to our business. It is unrealistic to expect that the European sovereign debt crisis, the Chinese tightening monetary policies and looming concerns over the growth in global economy can be entirely eased in the short-term. However, we already note some positive signals from the market in the beginning of 2012 including the gradual reduction of PBOC s reserve ratio and global efforts in formulating latest Greek bailout plan etc. With gradual restoration of consumer confidence, we observe our order level is gradually picking up from the trough of the end of 
Despite the challenge of the macro-environment, we are confident that we will seize current opportunities to further strengthen our position of market and technology leader in the industry with our advanced product which well-matched the Chinese government s emphasis of developing energy-saving, low emission, environmental friendly, high value-added and high precision machines. Starting from the second half of 2012, we plan to mass launch several new, second generation versions of existing product lines including Mars II (formerly named as Pallas), Venus II and Jupiter II. The new versions will offer higher precision, reliability, speed and price-performance ratio to our customers and expect to trigger higher demand of our PIMMs under the tough market conditions. With long-term committed strategy in enhancing R&D capabilities, we expect that the new products will continue to receive positive response from the market and further propel the overall average selling price with higher value-added product mix in the near future.
With outstanding achievements in gaining market share in overseas markets and penetrating into new overseas markets in 2011, we will continue to implement our strategy for 2012 to strengthen our export sales. Besides providing additional support to new overseas markets and new customers in existing ones, we have also assigned several experienced marketing managers to set up dedicated team to serve and follow up potential and existing multi-national corporation key accounts. In view of the fact that Haitian s market shares in global market is still relatively small compared with the domestic market, we believe our export sales still have great potential for growth with increasing recognition and innovation of Haitian production inspite of sluggish consumer demand worldwide.
The success of Haitian story is largely built on our prestigious brand image of commitment in innovation, outstanding product quality and customer services. Therefore, we have set quality assurance as one of key objectives in this year. In 2012, we start Quality Assurance Campaign that not only focuses on production process but also extend to our supply chain management and customer service. Through the series of measures, we can improve supply chain management and product quality, raise our production efficiency and enhance pre-sales and after-sales customer satisfaction.
With our commitment to our long-term development strategy that focuses on innovation, enhancement of product quality and globalisation, we have achieved encouraging results for the past years. Riding on our business foundation, financial strengthen and outstanding product quality, we are confident we will continue to deliver outstanding achievements in gaining market share, business growth and product development in 2012.

Finally, on behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to thanks all staff members for their contribution in the past year and at the same time, I would also like to express our gratitude towards our shareholders, customers, suppliers and business partners for their continued confidence in and support to our Group.
