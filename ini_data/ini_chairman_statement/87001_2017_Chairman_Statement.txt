CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENTThe missions in 2017 are to maximize
organic growth from our fl agship asset —
Beijing Oriental Plaza; to revamp Chongqing
Metropolitan Oriental Plaza through the
on-going asset enhancement programme and
to integrate two newly acquired hotels into
our growing portfolio of quality assets.
The year 2016 was characterised by global economic volatility and political change. Amidst a backdrop of a
challenging macro environment, a slower economic growth, a softening retail market and a change in tax policies in
China, Hui Xian REIT continues to make progress in 2016.
RESULTS AND DISTRIBUTION
The total revenue for the period from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016 (“Reporting Period”) was RMB3,106
million, slightly higher than the previous year. The amount was affected by the implementation of Value Added Tax
(“VAT”), effective from 1 May 2016. Excluding the impact of VAT reform, total revenue would have grown 3.4% yearon-year.
Net property income (“NPI”) was RMB2,074 million, a year-on-year increase of 1.9%. The amount was impacted by
the change in real estate tax regulations affecting Beijing, effective from 1 July 2016. Excluding the impact of the
additional real estate tax provision for Beijing Oriental Plaza, NPI would have increased 5.9% year-on-year.
The amount available for distribution for the Reporting Period was RMB1,546 million, up by 4.5% year-on-year. The
distribution per unit (“DPU”) for the second half of the year was RMB0.1315. Together with the interim DPU, the total
DPU for the year increased 2.0% year-on-year to RMB0.2754. The distribution yield was 8.8% based on the closing
unit price of RMB3.14 on 30 December 2016.
Excluding the impact of VAT reform and the additional real estate tax provision for Beijing Oriental Plaza, the amount
available for distribution, distributions to Unitholders and DPU would have increased 8.5%, 7.5% and 5.9% year-onyear
respectively.
BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN CHINA
According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the country’s gross domestic product (“GDP”) grew 6.7% in
2016, the slowest growth recorded since 1990. Total retail sales of consumer goods reached RMB33,232 billion in
2016, up by 10.4% year-on-year.
Cooling economic growth and the Central Government’s ongoing anti-extravagance policy continue to impact
consumer’s spending on luxury goods. Many luxury retailers reported reduced revenues and consolidated their retails
networks in light of shrinking demand.
The growth of online shopping, supported by convenient mobile payment and low logistics costs, is resulting in a
structural change to China’s retail market and changing traditional consumer behavior trends. Consumer spending
has been shifting from physical retail outlets to online purchases, adversely affecting the traffi c and sales at bricks and
mortar stores. During 2016, China’s online retail sales of physical goods grew by 25.6% year-on-year to RMB4,194
billion, accounting for about 12.6% of the country’s total retail sales of consumer goods according to offi cial statistics.
Traditional sales retail model would continue to be challenged by on-line shopping.
RMB EXCHANGE RATE
The RMB exchange rate against Hong Kong Dollars has declined by approximately 6.3%* since the end of 2015. This
has impacted both market and investor sentiment towards RMB-denominated assets. According to the Hong Kong
Monetary Authority, RMB deposits in Hong Kong as at the end of 2016 dropped 36% year-on-year from RMB851.1
billion to RMB546.7 billion.
All of Hui Xian REIT’s projects are located in China, hence generating income in RMB. As an RMB-denominated REIT,
the fi nancial statements of Hui Xian REIT are presented in RMB and its distribution to Unitholders is also in RMB. The
RMB exchange rate fl uctuation, therefore, does not have signifi cant impact on the performance of Hui Xian REIT’s
projects. However, as its current borrowings are in Hong Kong Dollars, the RMB exposure may appear when the
exchange gain or loss is realised upon loan repayment.
BUSINESS REVIEW
Hui Xian REIT’s portfolio consists of (1) Initial Portfolio: Beijing Oriental Plaza’s retail, offi ce and serviced apartment
businesses, and two hotels (Grand Hyatt Beijing and Sofi tel Shenyang Lido) acquired in 2011 and 2012; and (2) New
Investment: Chongqing Metropolitan Oriental Plaza acquired in March 2015.
(1) Initial Portfolio
(A) Retail Portfolio — The Malls at Beijing Oriental Plaza
Despite a challenging retail environment, The Malls at Beijing Oriental Plaza maintained high occupancy and rental
rates during the Reporting Period. The 130,000 square-metre mall continues to be popular among retailers and
shoppers due to its strategic location, well-managed tenant profi le and heavy footfall.
A large-scale asset enhancement and tenant mix optimization programme for two zones in The Malls commenced
in late 2015 and was completed in mid 2016. Both zones, totaling about 6,000 square metres, are now fully leased.
One of the zones is converted into 16 stand-alone shops, and the other zone is transformed into an open retail
environment housing a range of pop-up stores and eateries. The Malls’ appeal to customers is further strengthened
by an increased variety and diversity of retail choices.
The retail portfolio’s NPI was RMB935 million, slightly up by 0.2% year-on-year. Excluding the impact of the additional
real estate tax provision for Beijing Oriental Plaza, NPI would have increased 5.9% year-on-year. The average monthly
passing rent was RMB1,211 per square metre, an increase of 1.5% year-on-year. The average occupancy rate
increased from 94.9% in 2015 to 97.4% in 2016.
(B) Offi ce Portfolio — The Tower Offi ces at Beijing Oriental Plaza
The Tower Offi ces at Beijing Oriental Plaza feature over 300,000 square metres of Grade A offi ce space in eight
blocks.
While the macro environment remained uncertain, the offi ce portfolio maintained high occupancy and steady rental
growth during the Reporting Period.
The offi ce portfolio’s NPI was RMB835 million, an increase of 1.7% year-on-year. Excluding the impact of the
additional real estate tax provision for Beijing Oriental Plaza, NPI would have increased 5.4% year-on-year.
The average monthly passing rent was RMB276 per square metre, up by 2.2% over the previous year. The average
monthly spot rent was RMB331 per square metre, an increase of 11.2% year-on-year. The average occupancy rate
was 95.1%.
(C) Serviced Apartment Portfolio — The Tower Apartments at Beijing Oriental Plaza
The Tower Apartments at Beijing Oriental Plaza provides over 600 fully-furnished units in two towers. NPI of serviced
apartment portfolio was RMB73 million, an increase of 8.7% year-on-year. The average occupancy rate was 92.6%.
(D) Hotel Portfolio — Grand Hyatt Beijing and Sofi tel Shenyang Lido
The hotel portfolio consists of two fi ve-star hotels: Grand Hyatt Beijing and Sofi tel Shenyang Lido. With the
implementation of effective revenue and expense management, both hotels reported improved earnings in 2016. The
aggregate NPI increased 10.9% year-on-year to RMB135 million.
Grand Hyatt Beijing’s average occupancy rate during the Reporting Period increased from 58.8% in 2015 to 60.2% in
2016. The average room rate per night declined by 4.4% year-to-year to RMB1,397. The revenue per available room
(“RevPAR”) was RMB841, a year-on-year reduction of 2.1%.
Sofi tel Shenyang Lido’s average occupancy rate improved from 39.1% a year earlier to 45.7%, while the average
room rate per night fell by 7.2% year-on-year to RMB479. The RevPAR increased 8.5% year-on-year to RMB219.
(2) New Investment
Chongqing Metropolitan Oriental Plaza
Chongqing Metropolitan Oriental Plaza, comprising a shopping mall and a Grade A offi ce tower, was acquired in
March 2015. An intensive asset enhancement and revamp programme is in progress.
NPI was RMB96 million during the Reporting Period as compared to RMB93 million the previous year. The mall’s
average occupancy rate was 73.4% and the average monthly passing rent was RMB223 per square metre. The
average monthly passing rent and monthly spot rent of the offi ce tower were RMB124 per square metre and RMB131
per square metre respectively. The average occupancy rate was 89.2%.
STRONG FINANCIAL POSITION
Hui Xian REIT has continued to adhere to its prudent fi nancial management strategy throughout the Reporting Period.
Bank balances and cash on hand amounted to RMB7,072 million and total debts amounted to RMB10,816 million as
at 31 December 2016. Debts to gross asset value ratio was 23.0%. Hui Xian REIT has suffi cient fi nancial capacity to
capitalise on new investment opportunities as they arise.
SUBSEQUENT EVENT
On 9 January 2017, Hui Xian REIT announced the acquisition of two fi ve-star hotels in western China: a 100%
interest in Harbour Plaza Chongqing and a 69% interest in Sheraton Chengdu Lido Hotel. The acquisition has been
completed in the fi rst quarter of 2017.
Hui Xian REIT’s footprint has now extended to over 1.1 million square metres across four key cities in China. Its asset
portfolio comprises two malls, two offi ce developments, one serviced apartment development and four hotels.
OUTLOOK
The uncertainty and volatility that affected the global economy in 2016 are expected to continue in 2017. Retail
market in China will continue to face challenges and consolidation. Nevertheless, rising domestic travel would
stimulate domestic tourist spending on hotel and retail.
Looking ahead, Hui Xian REIT’s performance in 2017 remains affected by the additional property tax arising from
the change in real estate tax regulations introduced on 1 July 2016 in Beijing. The missions in 2017 are to maximize
organic growth from our fl agship asset — Beijing Oriental Plaza; to revamp Chongqing Metropolitan Oriental Plaza
through the on-going asset enhancement programme and to integrate two newly acquired hotels into our growing
portfolio of quality assets.
It remains a key strategy to continue to explore investment opportunities to generate long-term benefi ts for the
Unitholders.
On behalf of the Manager, I would like to thank all the Unitholders and the Trustee for their continued support and
commitment for Hui Xian REIT.
