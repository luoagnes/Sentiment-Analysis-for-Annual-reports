Our consolidated profit attributable to shareholders for 2014 was HK$9,516 million, compared to HK$12,525 million in 2013. Underlying profit attributable to shareholders, which principally adjusts for changes in the valuation of investment properties, increased by HK$804 million from HK$6,348 million in 2013 to HK$7,152 million in 2014.

The Company s policy is to pay dividends which will average approximately 50% of the underlying profit attributable to shareholders over the economic cycle. We will reevaluate this policy in the light of our financial position and the prevailing economic climate.
The Directors have declared a second interim dividend of HK44 (2013: HK40) per share which, together with the first interim dividend of HK22 per share paid in October 2014, amounts to full year dividends of HK66 (2013: HK60) per share. The second interim dividend, which totals HK$2,574 million (2013: HK$2,340 million), will be paid on Thursday, 7th May 2015 to shareholders registered at the close of business on the record date, being Friday, 10th April 2015.

In February 2014, Swire Properties entered into an agreement with the Hong Kong Government to acquire the latter s interest in Cornwall House in Taikoo Place, Hong Kong. The transaction is expected to be completed on or before 30th December 2016.

In February 2014, the company which owns an industrial site at 8-10 Wong Chuk Hang Road in Aberdeen, Hong Kong (in which Swire Properties has a 50% interest) agreed with the Hong Kong Government to modify the relevant Government leases so as to permit the site to be used for commercial purposes. The site is intended to be developed into an office building with an aggregate GFA of approximately 382,500 square feet.
In March 2014, Swire Properties started to pre-sell units in MOUNT PARKER RESIDENCES, a residential development in Quarry Bay, Hong Kong. Handover to purchasers began in May 2014.
The development comprises a 24-storey tower of 92 residential units with an aggregate GFA of 151,954 square feet.

In December 2014, Swire Properties completed a HK$100 million enhancement project at Cityplaza. Over 30 new retail brands were introduced to the mall.

The increase in underlying profit from HK$6,348 million in 2013 to HK$7,152 million in 2014 principally reflected increased income from retail and office investment properties, and higher trading profits from the sale of luxury residential properties in Hong Kong. Underlying profit from property investment increased by 8%. This reflected positive rental reversions in Hong Kong and higher rental income from properties in Mainland China. There were better performances in 2014 from our hotels in Hong Kong and the U.K. Our hotels in Mainland China recorded reduced losses.
Gross rental income was HK$10,320 million in 2014 compared to HK$9,676 million in 2013.
There were positive rental reversions in the Hong Kong portfolio. Our office occupancy levels were relatively resilient in 2014 despite demand being generally weak, particularly from financial institutions. Demand for retail space in Hong Kong continued to be robust, although there was a slowdown in retail sales in 2014. In Mainland China, retail sales of luxury goods were weak. Retailers were cautious about taking more space. Nevertheless, rental income increased at our TaiKoo Hui, Taikoo Li Sanlitun and INDIGO properties and occupancy was stable.
Operating profit from property trading increased in 2014, principally because we sold more units at our Hong Kong developments.
On an attributable basis, net investment property valuation gains in 2014, after deferred tax relating to investment properties in Mainland China, were HK$2,437 million, compared to net gains of HK$6,425 million in 2013.

Net debt at 31st December 2014 was HK$34,071 million, compared with HK$32,014 million at 31st December 2013. Gearing increased from 15.8% to 16.3%. The increase in borrowings was mainly due to the acquisition of a 20% interest in Taikoo Li Sanlitun and capital expenditure on the Brickell City Centre development in Miami. Cash and undrawn committed facilities totalled HK$9,622 million at 31st December 2014, compared with HK$9,854 million at 31st December 2013. We will continue to refinance (as necessary on maturity) inter-group funding provided by Swire Pacific and will do so on a stand-alone basis without recourse to Swire Pacific.

In Hong Kong, our ARGENTA residential development achieved Platinum status under the Building Environmental Assessment Method ( BEAM ). In 2014, our health and safety performance improved, with a 15% reduction in lost time injuries.

In Hong Kong, demand for office space, particularly from financial institutions, is likely to remain subdued. As a result rents will be under pressure in the Central district of Hong Kong. Pacific Place, however, has no major leases expiring in 2015 and occupancy rates are expected to remain stable. At Taikoo Place and Cityplaza, rents are expected to remain resilient owing to high occupancy. In Guangzhou and Beijing, office rents are expected to be under pressure in 2015 as a substantial supply of new office space 
Demand for luxury goods in Hong Kong has weakened. But overall retail sales in Hong Kong are expected to grow modestly in 2015. Demand for retail space at prime locations and well-managed shopping malls is expected to remain high. In Guangzhou and Beijing, demand for luxury goods has weakened but that for mid-price products is expected to grow satisfactorily. Retailers are cautious about expanding. In Chengdu, the retail market is expected to grow steadily in 2015, reflecting demand from consumers for international and local branded goods.

In Hong Kong, there is demand for luxury residential properties but there are not many transactions. Our profits from property trading are still expected to be significant in 2015, with the completion of the sales of presold units in the AREZZO development, the sales of completed houses at the 160 South Lantau Road development and the sales of remaining units at other completed residential developments. Profits are also expected on the completion of the sales of the presold office tower (Pinnacle One) at the Daci Temple project in Chengdu in Mainland China.
The performance of our hotels in Hong Kong is expected to be stable in 2015. Trading conditions for our hotels in Mainland China remain challenging because of oversupply.
On behalf of the shareholders and my fellow Directors, I wish to express our appreciation to all our employees, whose commitment and hard work have been central to our
