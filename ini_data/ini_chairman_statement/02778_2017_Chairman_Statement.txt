Chairman’s
Report To UnitholdersDuring the year under review, the
Trust performed strongly, delivering
its expected growth during 2016, and
achieving a record high distributable
income.
Looking ahead, the market is facing
a lot of uncertainties. We will
confidently apply all our knowledge,
expertise and innovation to meet
the challenges of the operating
environment and we will seek out any
opportunities arising in the current
market that will assist us to optimize
unitholders’ value in the long term.
Most importantly, prudence must be
observed.
During the year under review, the
Trust performed strongly, delivering
its expected growth during 2016,
and achieving a record high
distributable income.
In 2016, unexpected events such
as the UK’s Brexit vote in Europe
and the US Presidential Election
outcome have raised uncertainties
in the global economy, causing
volatilities in currency, stock
markets and interest rates. Against
this background, the Trust's 
distributable income increased
Distribution per unit("DPU")
achieved a solid growth of 15.7%
to HK$0.2295 (2015: HK$0.1983),
which was driven by rental income
increase from Three Garden Road
and cost savings due to its improved
occupancy.
Total rental income for 2016 was
HK$2,299 million, an increase of
11.5% compared with HK$2,063
million for 2015. The solid growth
was mainly due to higher average
occupancy of Three Garden
Road. As major leases committed
previously started to have a full year
impact, occupancy of the property
was maintained at above 90%
during 2016. Rental income of the
property went up by 19.7%. On the
other hand, innovative marketing
campaigns enabled the Langham
Place Mall to show resilience
against the retailing downturn and
recorded stable growth.
The higher average occupancy in
Three Garden Road helped reduce
the Trust’s overall operating costs
and the net property operating
expenses ratio thereby improved to
11.8% in 2016, compared with 13.5%
in 2015. The higher rental income
and lower net property operating
expenses resulted in an increase
of 13.6% in net property income.
Net property income for 2016 was
HK$2,027 million, compared with
HK$1,784 million for 2015.
While the refinancing undertaken
in June 2016 has reduced interest
margin and removed all refinancing
risks over the next few years, the
rising interest rate environment will
put pressure on funding costs. To
mitigate the impact of interest rate
rises, a more proactive approach
has been taken to increase the
fixed rate portion of total debt.
The Trust has also tapped the
bond market to lock in long-term
funding costs via private placement
under the Medium Term Note
Program. In addition, the Trust
has also commenced a hedging
program to swap part of the 
floating-rate loan into fixed-rate. As
at 27 February 2017, the Trust has
effectively fixed the interest rate of
HK$500 million of our bank loans
by entering into interest rate swap
contracts at an average interest rate
at 1.735%. Our fixed rate portion
accounts for 25% of total debt
outstanding for the time being, we
are watching the market closely for
opportunity to fix more.
The appraised value of the Trust’s
properties was HK$66.8 billion as
at 31 December 2016, an increase
of 3.2% compared with HK$64.8
billion as at 31 December 2015,
driven primarily by higher rental
rate assumptions. Net asset
value per unit was HK$8.72 as at
31 December 2016, an increase of
3.8% compared with HK$8.40 as
at 31 December 2015. The gearing
ratio decreased marginally to 21.7%
as at 31 December 2016 from 22.1%
as at 31 December 2015.
The world in 2017 would be an
uncertain place. Globally, the
uncertainty surrounding the new US
Administration has the potential to
create trade disputes and problems
to the worldwide economy, and
several elections in Europe later this
year may potentially add surprises
to the market. Closer to home the
uncertain China economic outlook
and the control on capital flow
will require us to be vigilant and
prudent. Strong US dollar might
dampen the recovery in tourist
numbers and spending in Hong
Kong. All these macro factors
together with higher interest rates
in the interest rate hike cycle could
impact DPU.
Looking ahead, the market is
facing a lot of uncertainties.
An uncertain market presents
challenges. However, it also leads
to opportunities and the Trust will
be looking closely for these. We will
confidently apply all our knowledge,
expertise and innovation to meet
the challenges of the operating
environment and we will seek out
any opportunities arising in the
current market that will assist us
to optimize unitholders’ value in
the long term. Most importantly,
prudence must be observed.
