Chairman s Statements 
On behalf of Haitian International Holdings Limited, ( Haitian or the Company ), with its subsidiaries (together, the Group ), I am pleased to present the Group s annual results for the year ended 31 December 2010.

2010 was a year of unprecedented growth in revenue and profit for Haitian. For the year ended 31 December 2010 (the Reporting Period ), we achieved sales of RMB7,057.3 million and profit attributable to shareholders of RMB1,062.6 million, representing an increase of 82.8% and 136.1% when compared with RMB3,861.3 million and RMB450.0 million in 2009 respectively. The substantial increase was a result of (i) the strong recovery of the domestic economy in the PRC from the financial crisis and continuous growth in consumption in both the PRC and some overseas markets which led to an increase in capital investment in manufacturing industries, (ii) expansion of our market share in both domestic and export markets as a result of strategic measures implemented during the financial crisis and (iii) a strong growth in the sales of our energy-saving plastic injection moulding machines (PIMMs), the Mars series and our all-electric PIMMs, the Venus series.
Domestic consumption in the PRC had been strong throughout 2010 and some of our export markets are also showing signs of growing demand in the second half of 2010. Such continuous high-level of demand and consumption of plastic products led to an unprecedented high-level of demand of our PIMMs. Most of our downstream industries, including automobiles, household electrical appliances, construction materials, plastic packaging, IT and electronic products etc. had shown a strong recovery from the financial crisis and had a substantial increase in their capital investment in 2010.
We had implemented a series of measures during the financial crisis in view of the weak demand and uncertain outlook, including strengthening our cost control, enhancing our production efficiency and increasing our after-sales servicing effort. All such measures, together with the important decision made by our management that no single production line was closed during the financial crisis, had prepared us to seize the recovery opportunity, expand our customer base and gain market share from our competitors. We have navigated through many crisis in our history of over 45 years and our management had once again demonstrated their determination to make Haitian a sustained and market-leading enterprise and their ability to explore opportunity through crisis.
Our energy-saving PIMMs, the Mars series, generated very strong demand in 2010. Its innovative and customer-oriented energy- saving features receive overwhelming recognition in the market and its sales have been growing since its initial launch in 2006 and even during the financial crisis. The recent emphasis of environmental-friendly policy by the PRC Government further drives the demand of our Mars series PIMMs and with four years of track record and experience in servicing customers on such machines, we have already established a market-leading position in energy-saving PIMMs segment and continue to draw demand from existing and new customers.
Domestic and export sales The Group s sales by geographic areas are summarized in the following table: (RMB million) 2010 % 2009 %

Export Sales Analysis 
The Group s domestic sales had recorded strong growth in 2010, rising 79.2% from RMB2,916.9 million in 2009 to RMB5,228.4 million in 2010. The growth is remarkable for a mature heavy machinery industry such as the PIMM manufacturing industry and it reflected the strong domestic consumption and demand for plastic products in the PRC. Despite the recent austerity measures of the PRC Government to restrict the liquidity in the financial market and control the rising inflation, we remain optimistic about the domestic consumption growth in the PRC in view of the rising purchasing power of the public and the PRC Government s continuous support for related industries.
The Group s export sales had also expanded substantially in 2010 from RMB841.1 million in 2009 to RMB1,698.5 million in 2010, representing a growth of 101.9% and exceeding our pre-financial-crisis record of RMB1,343.5 million in 2008 by 26.4%. We believe that there are still spaces for future growth in export sales as many developed economies in our current and potential overseas markets still have not returned to the pre-financial crisis growth rate and we will continue to expand our export coverage to broaden our reach to regions and countries where we can boost the sales of our PIMMs.
Small and medium-to-large tonnage sales The Group s sales by small tonnage and medium-to-large tonnage PIMMs are summarized in the following table: (RMB million) 2010 % 2009 %

Medium-to-large tonnage: PIMM with clamping force of 530 tonnes or more.
The Group s small tonnage PIMM sales in 2010 amounted to RMB4,458.6 million, representing a growth of 70.0% compared with RMB2,624.8 million in 2009 while our medium-to-large tonnage PIMM sales in 2010 amounted to RMB2,468.3 million, representing a growth of 117.8% compared with RMB1,133.2 million in 2009. The sales of medium-to-large tonnage PIMMs generally respond slower to change in economy and therefore had achieved a higher growth rate in 2010 when the market further recovered from the

Mars and Venus series The Group s sales of Mars series PIMMs (which are our Group s PIMMs with strong energy saving features) in 2009 and 2010 are summarized in the following table: (RMB million) 2010 
Mars 4,830.2 68.4% 2,082.0 53.9% +132.0% 2,098.4 64.9% 2,731.8 71.4% +30.2% Our energy-saving PIMMs, the Mars series, have continuously increased its penetration into the market and built our leadership in the new era of environmental-friendly machineries. Its innovative and customer-oriented energy-saving features are well-recognized in the market and it receives further support from the government s environmental-friendly policy which is one of the main focus in the PRC Government s next five-year plan. We recorded sales of Mars series PIMMs in the amount of RMB4,830.2 million in 2010, representing a growth of 132.0% compared with RMB2,082.0 million in 2009 and Mars series PIMMs accounted for 68.4% of our total sales in 2010. With a view to match the PRC Government s emphasis of energy-saving and environmental protection, we had completed modification to our production process and facilities and target that our domestic sales of hydraulic PIMMs in 2011 will comprise only Mars series PIMMs and PIMMs with Mars series energy-saving features.

The Group s sales of Venus series PIMMs (which are our Group s all-electric PIMMs) in 2009 and 2010 are summarized in the

Venus 172.0 2.4% 42.5 1.1% +304.7% 83.3 2.6% 88.7 2.3% +6.6% Only in the second year after its launch, our Group s first all-electric PIMMs, the Venus series, had recorded a very encouraging sales, amounting to RMB172.0 million and representing an increase of 304.7% compared with RMB42.5 million in 2009. All-electric PIMMs are required for manufacturing of high-precision plastic products which are consumed in high-tech industries such as IT & electronics, automobiles and packaging and our ability to manufacture and sell self-developed all-electric PIMMs reflects our strong research and development capability. Our Venus series PIMMs are able to compete not only with overseas branded PIMMs imported to the PRC market but also globally with other brands in different overseas markets and we believe there are substantial spaces for future growth of such products.

Our continuous input in research and development and launch of successful new models of PIMMs, such as Mars and Venus series, with technological features which are leading in the PRC and competitive with overseas brand, has separated ourselves from local competitors which are mostly focused on cost efficiency and low-end and mid-end products. Our latest high-end all electric PIMMs, the Mercury series, with technological features which we believe are pioneer on a global scale, will further strengthen our position as a key player in the PIMM industry worldwide and attract new customers globally.
2010 marked the fifth year since our initial public offering in 2006. During these years, our management and employees had devoted their time and effort to the growth of Haitian and helped establish Haitian as a world-leading PIMM manufacturer. Our Group had recorded a compound annual growth rate of 22.1% in its revenue and 23.9% in its profit attributable to shareholders between 2006 and 2010 and we believe Haitian will continue to bring growth and value to our customers and shareholders in the 
The high-level of orders for our PIMMs in 2010 had continued into the first two months of 2011 during which our sales were more than 20% above the same period in 2010. We are confident that our leading position in the market, the new market share earned in 2010 and our continuous innovation in product design will continue to grow and support our performance in 2011. However, after considering the macro-economy environment in both domestic and international markets in 2011, we are also aware of the potential risk of a slow-down in growth of business in view of a number of factors, including the austerity measures implemented by the PRC Government to control liquidity and inflation, the uncertain outlook of some of our downstream industries and the volatility in raw material prices brought by the fluctuations in the commodity market. Our management will closely monitor the development of the above-mentioned risks and plan to tackle such risks with the following measures: Strengthen export sales In 2010, the PRC economy demonstrated a fast recovery from the financial crisis and as a result the business growth for our domestic sales surpassed our export sales growth after the financial crisis. In 2011, in contrast, the growth in overseas economy is expected to become more stable and accordingly we will strengthen our export sales effort through developing more overseas markets, expanding our product-mix for our export business, adjusting our marketing and sales strategy and increasing our production capacity for export sales (our new production facility at Vietnam is expected to commence operation in the second quarter of 2011) in order to capture the restored growth of the PIMM industry in our export markets.
Raise operational efficiency By the end of 2010, we had completed the upgrade of metal processing equipment in most of our existing production facilities and we plan to further upgrade and enhance our production facilities to increase their efficiency and rate of output.
Our management has formulated a new strategy to strengthen our market leading position and scale of operation with the introduction of Lean Manufacturing concept to our Group. Through a series of measures such as improving production environment, revising production flow, strengthening technology used in production linkage, reducing wastes and raising production efficiency, we intend to increase our efficiency through exploring potential in different internal aspects of our operation. This will allow us to shorten our capital cycle, reduce inventory level, enhance our response to market feed-back and raise our profit margin and ability to resist external risk in economy.
Increase research and development input We will continue to increase our investment in the research and development of new technologies, new products and new applications of our PIMMs and target to enhance the precision, energy-saving capability, reliability and price-performance ratio of our products. We plan to launch our next generation of hydraulic-electric energy saving PIMMs, the Pallas series, in the second half of 2011 which will further strengthen our competitiveness in the market.
Our another focus in 2011 will be to increase the scale of research and development and production capacity for our high-end all-electric PIMMs and thereby raising our market share in this segment. The sales of our first all-electric PIMMs, the Venus series, have remained at a high level in the start of 2011, reflecting the general acceptance of our first high-end PIMMs among our customers and setting the platform for our future growth in high-end PIMMs. We also plan to launch our next generation of all- electric PIMMs, the Mercury series, in 2011, which have features which we believe are pioneer in the international PIMM industry.
We are also preparing to launch a new generation of energy-saving machines for our Tianjian brand PIMMs, through which we will be able to further penetrate into different spectrum of the PIMM industries.
Strengthen after-sale services We will also strengthen our capability and quality of after-sale services to our customers. We will provide better support to our distributors and agents, reduce the response-time for our after-sale services, raise the efficiency in the delivery of parts and components to customers, strengthen technical support to customers and provide incentive schemes to our employees for after-sale services provided. We believe such measures will increase our customers confidence in our products, enhance communication with the customers and consequently raise the brand image and value of our Haitian, Zhafir and Tianjian brands.
We believe that through the above-mentioned measures, Haitian will be able to deliver outstanding results in 2011 and bring satisfactory returns to our shareholders.

Finally, on behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to thanks all staff members for their contribution in the past year and at the same time, I would also like to express our gratitude towards our shareholders, customers, suppliers and business partners for their continued confidence in and support to our Group.
