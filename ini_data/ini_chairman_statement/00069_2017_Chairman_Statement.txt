CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Dear Shareholders,
On behalf of the Board, I would like to present the Annual
Report of Shangri-La Asia Limited for the financial year
ended 31 December 2016.
The Group achieved improved hotel performance in
Mainland China and Southeast Asia despite the challenging
global and regional business environment and the impact
of weakening local currencies on hotels’ operating
performance. The Group also opened three hotels,
including our first property in Sri Lanka, and signed a
management agreement for one hotel being developed by
a third party.
The performance of our investment property portfolio again
recorded a healthy improvement. Property sales increased
in 2016 mainly from residential sales in Mainland China,
and property rentals and sales made a positive contribution
to the Group’s results for the year.
Consolidated sales revenue decreased slightly by 3% over
2015 to US$2,055.4 million. After tax profit (before
non-operating items) attributable to shareholders increased
by 60% compared to the previous year. After tax profit
(inclusive of non-operating items) attributable to
shareholders decreased by 24% to US$106.1 million.
The Group achieved
improved hotel
performance in
Mainland China and
Southeast Asia…
A final dividend of HK8 cents per ordinary share has been
proposed, which when added to the interim dividend will
amount to a total dividend of HK13 cents per share for the
financial year.
I wish to thank all our staff and management for their
dedication and hard work, my fellow Directors for their
valued guidance and our shareholders for their continued
support.
It has been a privilege and honour to serve as Chairman
these past few years, and I appreciate you extending your
full support to the Group’s new Chairman, KUOK Hui
Kwong.
