Chairman’s
StatementOur consolidated profit attributable to shareholders for 2016
was HK$15,050 million, compared to HK$14,072 million in
2015. Underlying profit attributable to shareholders, which
principally adjusts for changes in the valuation of investment
properties, increased by HK$34 million from HK$7,078 million
in 2015 to HK$7,112 million in 2016.
Dividends
The Directors have declared a second interim dividend of HK$0.48 (2015: HK$0.48) per share
which, together with the first interim dividend of HK$0.23 per share paid in October 2016,
amounts to full year dividends of HK$0.71 (2015: HK$0.71) per share. The second interim
dividend, which totals HK$2,808 million (2015: HK$2,808 million), will be paid on Thursday,
11th May 2017 to shareholders registered at the close of business on the record date, being
Friday, 7th April 2017. Shares of the Company will be traded ex-dividend from Wednesday,
5th April 2017.
Key Developments
In March 2016, Swire Properties opened the first of two office towers (Three Brickell City Centre)
in the Brickell City Centre development in Miami, U.S.A.
In April 2016, Swire Properties started to pre-sell units in ALASSIO, a residential development in
Mid-Levels West, Hong Kong. The development consists of a 50-storey tower of 197 residential
units. All units have been pre-sold.
In June 2016, EAST, Miami opened at the Brickell City Centre development in Miami, U.S.A. It has
352 rooms including 89 serviced apartments.
In July 2016, Swire Properties announced the HK$15 billion redevelopment of Taikoo Place. Two
new Grade-A office buildings, each with an aggregate gross floor area (“GFA”) of around one million
square feet, are expected to be completed, the first (One Taikoo Place) in 2018 and the second
(Two Taikoo Place) in 2021 or 2022.
In August 2016, the shopping mall and one of the two premium Grade-A office towers (HKRI Centre
One) at the HKRI Taikoo Hui development in Puxi, Shanghai were completed. Handover to tenants is
in progress.
In October 2016, Swire Properties conditionally agreed to sell its 100% interest in the company
which owns an uncompleted investment property development in Kowloon Bay, Hong Kong for a
cash consideration of HK$6,528 million, subject to adjustments. Completion of the sale is conditional
upon the relevant occupation permit and certificate of compliance being obtained on or before
31st December 2018.
In November 2016, Swire Properties opened its 60.9% owned 500,000 square feet shopping centre in
the Brickell City Centre development in Miami, U.S.A.
Operating Performance
The underlying profit in 2016 (HK$7,112 million) recorded a marginal increase from that in 2015
(HK$7,078 million). The 2015 profit included a loss of HK$229 million on disposal of four hotels
in the U.K. In 2016, there was a small decrease in underlying profit from property investment and a
small increase in underlying profit from property trading. Disregarding the loss on disposal in 2015,
the underlying loss from hotels was little changed in 2016.
Gross rental income was HK$10,773 million in 2016 compared to HK$10,716 million in 2015. Gross
rental income fell in Hong Kong and increased in Mainland China and the U.S.A. The reduction in
Hong Kong largely reflected lower retail rental income consequent on lower retail sales. Office rental
income in Hong Kong increased despite the loss of rental income resulting from the Taikoo Place
redevelopment. In Mainland China, gross rental income increased by 2% despite a 6% depreciation
of the Renminbi against the Hong Kong dollar.
Profit from property trading in 2016 included that recognised on the sales of residential units in the
U.S.A. Fewer residential properties were sold in Hong Kong. No sales of office property took place in
Mainland China.
The performance of the hotels in Mainland China improved, while at the same time hotels in Hong
Kong were adversely affected by a reduction in the number of visitors to Hong Kong.
On an attributable basis, net investment property valuation gains in 2016, after deferred tax relating
to investment properties in Mainland China and the U.S.A., were HK$8,030 million, compared to net
gains of HK$7,055 million in 2015.
Finance
Net debt at 31st December 2016 was HK$35,377 million, compared with HK$33,348 million at
31st December 2015. Gearing increased from 15.3% at 31st December 2015 to 15.6% at
31st December 2016. The increase in net debt was mainly due to expenditure on investment and
trading properties in Hong Kong and on the Brickell City Centre development in Miami in the U.S.A.,
partially offset by sales proceeds from trading properties in Hong Kong and Miami. Cash and
undrawn committed facilities totalled HK$10,178 million at 31st December 2016, compared with
HK$12,193 million at 31st December 2015.
Sustainable Development
In 2016, Swire Properties launched a new sustainable development strategy. For further details,
please see pages 80 to 83. Swire Properties is included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices,
the FTSE4Good Index, the Hang Seng Corporate Sustainability Index and the MSCI World ESG Index.
Prospects
In the central district of Hong Kong, high occupancy and limited supply will continue to underpin
office rents in 2017. High occupancy is expected to result in office rents in our Taikoo Place and
Cityplaza developments being resilient despite increased supply in Kowloon East and other districts.
In Guangzhou, office rents are expected to be stable in 2017 despite a substantial supply of new
office space. In Beijing, office rents are expected to be weak in 2017, with only modest demand and
increased supply. In Shanghai, there will be limited new supply of office space in the Puxi business
district. In Miami, there is limited new supply of Grade-A office space.
Demand for space from Hong Kong retailers dependent on tourism is likely to remain weak in 2017.
Demand for space from other retailers is likely to be stable. Retail sales are expected to grow
modestly in Guangzhou and Beijing and more briskly in Chengdu. In Shanghai, demand for retail
space is expected to remain firm except for space for luxury goods. In the U.S.A., weak retail sales
have made some retailers cautious about expansion.
In Hong Kong, notwithstanding the expectation of a gradual increase in interest rates, overall
demand for residential property remains resilient. Trading profits are expected to be recognised in
2017 from the handover of pre-sold units at ALASSIO and sales of units at WHITESANDS. In Miami,
profits are expected to be recognised on the sales of units at the Reach and Rise developments.
Trading conditions for our hotels are expected to remain difficult in 2017.
On behalf of the shareholders and my fellow Directors, I wish to express our appreciation to all our
employees, whose commitment and hard work have been central to our continuing success.
