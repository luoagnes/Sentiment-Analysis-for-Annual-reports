A conditional placing agreement was also entered into to place 600,000,000 new shares of the Company on a fully underwritten basis. Subsequently, a refundable deposit of HK$150 million was paid and a loan of HK$50 million was made to Redstone, secured by share mortgages over 90% of the issued share capital of Redstone and personal guarantee given by the beneficial owner of such 90% issued share capital of Redstone. The refundable deposit and loan to Redstone are all financed by other borrowings.
The Group is in the process of carrying out its due diligence exercise on Redstone and the circular containing, inter alia, a notice to convene a special general meeting to approve the acquisition, is expected to be despatched to shareholders by 30th June, 2008.
The Group understands from the vendors that Redstone beneficially owns 85% interest in two gold mines with mining licences and four gold mines with gold exploration permits in Yunnan Province, China, and the vendor has warranted that the six gold mines mentioned above will together maintain its JORC Gold Resources of not less than 50 tonnes (metric) of contained gold metal in total at the completion of the acquisition.

The net current liabilities and high gearing ratio was the result of additional other borrowings obtained for financing payment of the refundable deposit and loan to Redstone for the Conditional Acquisition.
Foreign Exchange Fluctuation The Group s operations are mainly located in mainland China and its transactions, related working capital and borrowings are primarily denominated in Renminbi and Hong Kong Dollars. The Group monitors its foreign exchange exposure and will consider hedging significant currency exposure should the need arise.
Charges on Assets As of 31st December 2007, bank deposits of HK$26,391,000 (2006: HK$24,808,000) were pledged to banks and financial institutions as collateral mainly to secure short term banking facilities in respect of bills payable 
EMPLOYEES AND REMUNERATION POLICIES As of 31st December, 2007, the Group, including its subsidiaries but excluding its associates, employed 634 (2006: 668) employees.

During the year, the Group constantly reviewed the risk and credit control systems of its profit centres to improve the overall control system and mitigate the credit risk.

Cement consumption in Shanghai reached its peak in 2006 and 2007 saw decreasing demand for cement in the industry. The austerity measures taken in Shanghai were much stricter than in other provinces and have adversely affected Shanghai s economic development. The increase in the price of coal has led to an increase in the unit cost of production and without a corresponding increase in the cement price, the profit margin of the cement manufacturers will continue to be affected. Nevertheless, it is hoped that the reconstruction activities after the catastrophe resulting from the recent severe weather conditions and the anticipated demand from events such as Shanghai World Exposition, Beijing-Shanghai Railway and Shanghai Hongqiao Transportation Hub will lead to greater cement consumption and help to mitigate the situation.
Being one of the cement companies selected by the Ministry of Land and Resources and the People s Bank of China to be under the auspices of the State, the Group has devoted its resources to enhancing internal control and technology development to improve its competitiveness.
Global demand for gold has increased substantially since early 2006. It is expected that the gold market in China, the third largest gold consumer in the world, will follow such a trend. Further, the gold market in China has been gradually deregulated in recent years and the Chinese Government has established a series of policies to promote the development of the gold industry to encourage gold mining enterprises to use advanced technologies in mining and production by granting them preferential treatment on taxation. These developments have significantly improved the business environment of the gold mining industry in China.
The Group believes that the acquisition of Redstone presents a good opportunity to develop our investment and business in the natural resources sector, and enable the Group to increase earnings and enhance value for shareholders by diversifying into the potentially profitable gold mining business in China.

Mr. Li Chi Kong and Ms. Iris Wong Ping resigned as Directors of the Company in July 2007. On behalf of the Board, I wish to express my appreciation and thank them for their invaluable contribution to the Group.
I would like to take this opportunity to welcome Ms. Chong Sok Un, Dato Wong Peng Chong and Mr. Kong Muk Yin to the Board. With their experience and expertise, they will provide valuable guidance to the Board in its deliberations.
Lastly, I would like to extend my sincere thanks to our shareholders for their continued support, my fellow Directors for their contribution and our staff for their diligence.
