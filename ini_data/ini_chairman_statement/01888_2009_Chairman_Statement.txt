Chairman s Statement 
On behalf of the Board of Directors, I am delighted to report to our shareholders that Kingboard Laminates Holdings Limited ( the Company ) and its subsidiaries ( the Group ) delivered resilient results for the financial year ended 31 December 2008 amid adverse business conditions in the second half of 2008.
The Group chalked up modest growth in both revenue and net profit for the first half of 2008 on the back of stable business.
However, the sudden downturn in the world economy posted a severe impact on the entire supply chain of the global technology sector towards the end of 2008. The Group experienced a fall in both revenue and net profit in the fourth quarter of 2008 ( Q4 2008 ). In spite of this extremely tough operating environment, the Group stayed profitable for the full year of 2008 and our financial position remained robust. This clearly demonstrates that our business model with a flexible and effective cost structure has successfully buffered the Group against the cyclicality of the

The electronics industry was impacted badly in Q4 2008 by the snowball effect of the global credit crunch which affected all business sectors. In anticipation of shrinking demand, manufacturers in the electronics supply chain reacted by scaling down production and slashing inventories aggressively towards the year end. During the year under review, copper price remained highly volatile and fell more than 50% in Q4 2008 against its peak in July 2008. Lower average selling prices coupled with reduced shipments in Q4 2008 posed pressure on the profit margin. As a result, consolidated revenue of the Group declined 3% to HK$10,127.8 million. Underlying earnings before interest and tax ( EBIT ) decreased 37% to HK$1,410.4 million (excluding one-off non-cash exceptional item) over the previous year. Volume sales dropped around 6% with average monthly shipment reaching 7.2 million square meters. However, our resilient performance clearly indicated that we have outperformed our peers during this down cycle.
Distribution costs increased 5% as new production capacity for upstream materials came on stream in the first half of 2008.
Administrative expenses increased marginally by 1% against that of previous year. Finance costs decreased to HK$116.1 million mainly attributable to lower interest rates on bank borrowings.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our consolidated financial and liquidity position continued to be solid. As at 31 December 2008, net current assets and current ratio of the Group were approximately HK$4,004.0 million (31 December 2007 4,538.7 million) and 2.61 (31 December 2007 2.92), respectively.
The net working capital cycle reduced to 113 days as at 31 December 2008 from 121 days as at 31 December 2007 on the following key metrics: Inventories, in terms of stock turnover days, slightly increased to 75 days (31 December 2007 72 days).
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (continued) Trade receivables including amounts due from fellow subsidiaries, in terms of debtors turnover days, greatly reduced to 70 days (31 December 2007 100 days), as a result of decrease in sales revenue in Q4 2008.
Trade and bills payables including amounts due to fellow subsidiaries, in terms of creditors turnover days, significantly decreased to 32 days (31 December 2007 51 days) in line with reduction in purchase volume.
The Group s net gearing ratio (ratio of interest bearing borrowings net of cash and cash equivalents to total equity) was greatly reduced to 12% (31 December 2007 23%) as a result of positive operating cash inflow and lower working capital requirement. In 2008, the Group invested HK$1,076 million in new production capacity and made deposits of HK$78 million for properties, plant and equipment. The proportion of bank borrowings between short term and long term stood at 34%:66% (31 December 2007: 20%:80%). As at 31 December 2008, the Group had committed and undrawn bank loan facilities and cash on hand of HK$700 million and HK$2.2 billion respectively.
Hence, the Group is in a strong financial position to capitalise on any opportunities arising from the current downturn. Less than 1% of the bank borrowings was denominated in Renminbi and the rest in Hong Kong or US dollars.
The Group continued to adopt a prudent financial management policy including the use of interest rate swap contract to minimise its exposure to fluctuation in interest rates movement. At the end of 2008, we had entered into interest rate swap agreements of notional amount of HK$2.0 billion with reputable financial institutions for a weighted average duration of 1.4 years and interest rate of 2.78%. The Group also entered into commodity and foreign currency forward contracts to manage the Group s exposure to fluctuation in exchange rates and commodities prices. The fair value of these contracts amounted to HK$2.8 million as at 31 December 2008. Other than derivative financial instruments in connection with our daily operations as mentioned above, the Group had not entered into any other type of derivative financial instruments throughout 2008. There was no material foreign exchange exposure to the Group during the year under review. The Group s revenue, mostly denominated in Hong Kong dollars, Renminbi and US dollars, was fairly matched with the currency requirement of operating expenses.

As at 31 December 2008, the Group had a workforce of over 8,000 (31 December 2007: 8,600). The decrease in headcount was in line with reduction in manufacturing output in Q4 2008. In addition to offering competitive salary package, the Group grants discretionary bonuses to eligible employees based on our overall financial achievement and their individual performance.

Although the global electronics industry faces significant challenges in 2009, our business outlook remains positive in the long term. As a key manufacturer for laminate products in China, we shall benefit from the enormous growth potential of this emerging market. A series of economic stimulus measures introduced by the Chinese government recently, in particular, the subsidy policy for electronic products purchase in the rural area is likely to have a positive effect on the growth prospects for the Group. Given our robust balance sheet, strategic focus on producing mass demand laminates and dedicated management team with excellent track record, we believe that the Group will surmount current challenges and emerge from this downturn as an even stronger player.
The Group experienced an uptrend in demand in February 2009.
As a result, all laminate plants operated at higher utilisation rates in February 2009 as compared to January 2009. In addition, reduced raw material costs in Q1 2009 is expected to ease margin pressure as compared to that experienced in Q4 2008.
Shrinking end customer demand together with intense competition will drive weaker players to cut production capacities or exit the market altogether. Further industrial consolidation is expected in the next few quarters. With our unrivaled position in the laminate industry, the Group is well poised to benefit from the consolidation. Whilst we have no imminent intention to expand capacity, we will continue to invest in high end laminate production capabilities, including thin and high performance laminate, to further enhance our competitive advantage.

On behalf of the Board, I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to our shareholders, customers, banks, the management and employees for their unreserved support to the Group in the past financial year.
