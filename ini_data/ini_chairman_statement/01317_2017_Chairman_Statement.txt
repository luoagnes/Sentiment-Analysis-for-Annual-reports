On behalf of the board of directors (the “Board”) of
China Maple Leaf Educational Systems Limited (the

During the year ended 31 August 2017, the Group

leased from KPU in September 2017. Grade 12
graduates of Maple Leaf School – KPU will receive a
BC diploma and a Chinese diploma.
On 5 February 2017, the Group entered into agreements
with third parties independent of the Company to

its first international school in Singapore.
All our high schools with students enrolled in grade
10 to 12 have been accredited by AdvancED, the
largest school accreditation agency in the United
States of America. Our middle and elementary
schools provide Chinese compulsory education
with English enhancement classes to our students.
Our kindergartens provide a play-based, bilingual
curriculum designed and developed by Maple Leaf

Our result performance for the year ended 31
August 2017 was encouraging. Total revenue reached
RMB1,083.2 million, an increase of 30.5%. Profit for the
year increased by 34.5% to RMB413.7 million whereas
adjusted net profit for the year was RMB428.0 million,
up 40.9%. The Board has resolved to recommend the
payment of a final dividend of HK$8.6 cents per share
for the year ended 31 August 2017. Together with the
interim dividend of HK$6.0 cents per share, this will
bring a total dividend of HK$14.6 cents per share for
the year ended 31 August 2017.
BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS
The Group operates all of its schools under the “Maple
Leaf” brand. Each school year normally runs from the
beginning of September each year to the middle of
July in the next year. As at the end of the 2016/2017
school year, a total of 26,088 students were enroled
in 60 schools located at 16 cities in China and Canada,
representing a growth of 34.9% compared with the
student enrolment as at the end of the 2015/2016
school year. Revenue from tuition fees increased
26.3% to RMB877.6 million for the year ended 31
August 2017. According to our internal statistics, for
the year ended 31 August 2017, the Group had 1,807
high school graduates, 46 of whom received offers
from top 10 universities and more than 56% of whom
received offers from the Maple Leaf Global Top 100
universities. Subsequent to the year ended 31 August
2017, the total number of students enroled as at 15
October 2017 was 28,111 representing an increase
of 36.5% compared with the student enrolment as at
the same month in 2016. Furthermore, a total of 14
schools in 4 new cities, namely Yancheng, Huzhou,
Weifang and Richmond, Canada, were added to the
Group’s school network, giving the network a total
of 71 schools located at 18 cities in China and 2 high
schools in Canada.
OUTLOOK
The overall target set in our fifth five-year plan for the
2015/2016 to the 2019/2020 school years (the “Fifth
Five-Year Plan”) is to reach total student enrolment
of more than 40,000 by the end of the 2019/2020
school year. This student enrolment target remains
unchanged. We expects to achieve a target of running
more than 70 schools in at least 20 cities in China by
the end of the 2018/2019 school year and complete
its national layout of school locations as set out in
the Fifth Five-Year Plan.
Under our school development plan for the 2017/2018
and 2018/2019 school years, we will continue to open
more middle and elementary schools in those second
and third tier cities in China for providing feeders
to our high schools located in nearby cities. In this
regard, the asset light model by partnering with public
or private entities remains our focused strategy.
Moreover, we plan to set up preschools in each of the
cities where it operates Maple Leaf schools. We will
also explore some potential acquisition opportunities
in China which will create a synergy with the Group
and fit the educational philosophy of Maple Leaf.
We will consider opening schools in first tier cities
in China, including Beijing and Shenzhen within the
next two school years.
Apart from the expansion plan in China, the Board
is of the view that overseas expansion is part of our
long term growth strategies. We can see the growing
demand for bilingual English and Chinese education
in belt and road (the “Belt and Road”) countries. The
Group believes we have unique advantages in filling
up the gap of demand for quality international K-12
education along the Belt and Road. Our students in
China will benefit from a global presence of Maple
Leaf brand schools.
The Board is confident to maintain the Group’s
leading position as an international school operator
in China by combining the merits of both Western
and Chinese educational philosophies.
SHARE AWARD SCHEME
The Board realizes the importance of the retention
of and motivation for talent who plays important
roles in the implementation of the Fifth Five-Year
Plan. The Company has adopted, among other
incentives, a restricted share award scheme (“Share
Award Scheme”) under which share awards will be
granted to the Directors, executive officers, senior
management, employees and consultants of the
Group aiming to attract and retain talent, recognize
their contributions and align their interests with those
of the Shareholders. In July 2015, the trustee of the
Share Award Scheme purchased a total of 31,080,000
shares of the Company on the market. During the year
ended 31 August 2017, a total of 5,570,896 Shares
were granted from the Share Award Scheme of which
5,490,000 Shares were granted to approximately 292
employees of the Group and 80,896 Shares were
granted to a consultant of the Company.
APPRECIATION
On behalf of the Board, I would like to express my
heartfelt gratitude to our students’ parents, the
local government, and our Shareholders for their
continuing support. I also wish to thank our fellow
Board members and senior management for their
contributions and hard work during the year and
extend my appreciation to our management, teachers
and staff for their endeavors and commitments to
provide high quality education.
