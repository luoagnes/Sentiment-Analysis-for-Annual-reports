Loss attributable to owners of the Company for the Year was HK$8,858.2 million as compared to profit of HK$10,023.4 million (restated) for last year.

If the net loss on the major non-cash items of HK$10,748.9 million (year ended 31st December, 2009: gain of HK$8,606.1 million (restated)) are excluded, the Group will have a core profit attributable to owners of the Company for the Year of HK$1,890.7 million (year ended 31st December, 2009: HK$1,417.3 million) and a core earnings per share of HK98.2 cents (year ended 31st December, 2009: HK71.0 cents), an increase of 33.4% and 38.3% over 2009 respectively.
