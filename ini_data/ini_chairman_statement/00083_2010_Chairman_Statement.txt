(6) mainland china Business China remains one of the fastest-growing countries in terms of GDP growth in the first half of 2010. The fiscal and monetary stimulus measures implemented throughout the critical periods of the global economic turmoil have taken effect to sustain aggregate consumer demand, support investment spending in the private and public sectors and inject the required level of liquidity, which are filtering through the banking and industrial sectors. The Central Government has also made substantial effort to maintain the continuity and stability of macro economic policy with specific and effective measures. This will establish the foundation for the nation s long-term prosperity and the economic development in Mainland China will directly benefit Hong Kong s economy.

This year saw active measures by the Central Government to ensure healthy and sustainable development in the property market, allowing more people to own their own homes, which is important for the welfare of society. Despite tightening measures recently introduced by the Central Government, demand remains good mainly due to income growth, wealth effect as a result of growing number of entrepreneurs and increasing affluent class. Management remains optimistic about the property market in Mainland China.

These have given the Group a good foothold in Mainland China s property market.
The Group s interest in Raffles City Shanghai, comprising office and retail space in the central business area of Shanghai s Huangpu District, is the stepping stone for the Group to establish its presence in this important city and financial centre. The Group s track record represents a history of good execution capability for property development and investment in Mainland 
As at 30th June, 2010, the Group s Mainland China land bank totalled 25.7 million square feet in Shanghai, Chengdu, Chongqing, Zhangzhou, Guangzhou, Xiamen, Fuzhou and Shenzhen.

The Group continues to exercise a focused approach to land bank replenishment and property development in Mainland China that can deliver good shareholder value. The majority of its developments are residential properties, which are built for sale. Commercial portions of sites are retained mainly for investment purposes. As management considers Mainland China an important market for the Group to grow in the mediumlong term, it has been actively seeking attractive sites in cities with strong economic fundamentals. The Group will capitalise on its strengths it has established in Hong Kong and Singapore to execute its property development business in Mainland China and position its products and services as the preferred choice.

The increase in gearing compared with that of 8.3% as at 31st December, 2009 and 16.5% as at 30th June, 2009 was mainly due to payment of land premiums.

prospects The world economy has been improving since the second half of 2009. Policy efforts around the world have been taking effect at varying degree. Monetary conditions remain accommodative with liquidity flowing into the financial system and helping to restore stability in the sector. Governments around the world have been closely monitoring their respective economic situations to ensure a sustainable recovery. Despite the occurrence of sovereign debt crisis in some countries in the Eurozone in the last quarter of 2009, the coordinated policy efforts by the governments of member states in the European Union and the support of intergovernmental organisations have helped the region to weather the

chairman s statement (Continued) 
The Central Government of PRC has also made tremendous efforts in steering domestic growth from an export-led model to a demand-led model and rebalancing the structure of the economy. Policy efforts since the last quarter of 2009 have largely focused on the domestic property market. These measures help ensure a healthy and sustainable property market. Corrections in terms of transaction volume and prices have been felt through the second quarter of 2010 confirming the effectiveness of measures taken to restore a more balanced growth to the property sector.

The Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement signed in Chongqing in June 2010 by the Mainland s Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits and Taiwan s Straits Exchange Foundation will gradually reduce and remove trade and investment barriers. This will facilitate greater trade flows and closer industrial integration between the Mainland and Taiwan, creating more business opportunities and benefiting both economies.

The economic growth of Hong Kong is evident by positive GDP growth for three consecutive quarters with an upward revised forecast in the range of 5% to 6% for the full year of 2010. Improving trade flows; salary increases and better bonuses as well as rising visitor arrivals starting in early 2010 have had a stimulating effect in the economy. Employment prospects have been improving with many industries and businesses planning to hire more people.

A fruitful year, 2010 has seen the property market reach a number of milestones that lay the foundation for better governance, and a more efficient and transparent market. The new guidelines introduced jointly by HKSAR Government and REDA for sales of residential properties help strengthen home- buyers confidence. To sustain a balance in supply and demand, the land supply arrangements with the MTR Corporation Limited and the Urban Renewal Authority are being fine-tuned, and the pace to bring readily available residential sites from the existing Land Application List for 20102011 to the market for auction has been increased. The recent land auctions in Hong Kong have received overwhelming market responses. With low mortgage rates, strong liquidity in the banking sector, willingness of banks to lend for home purchases, continuing interest from Mainland buyers, demand for quality housing remains strong.

chairman s statement (Continued) 
On the finance sector side, to prepare for the implementation of the pilot scheme for the use of Renminbi in settling cross-border trade transactions between Mainland China and Hong Kong, a Memorandum of Co-operation has been signed by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and People s Bank of China in July 2010.
This will allow eligible enterprises to open Renminbi denominated bank accounts and will greatly facilitate Renminbi denominated transactions. It will also create considerable market opportunities for businesses involving China trade, industries with factories in Mainland China and property developments in the country. On the infrastructure development side, the high-speed Hong Kong section of the Express Rail Link connecting Mainland China s massive railway network, and the expected 20152016 opening of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge Hong Kong Link Road connecting major southern coastal cities in The Pearl River Delta Region, will also enhance regional accessibility and connectivity by engendering more efficient flows of traffic, goods and people. These massive developments will also increase employment across a wide range of professions and occupations.

With a further improvement in the global economic situation, the Group continues to be well positioned to seek business opportunities. Management will strive to optimise earnings, improve the quality of products and services, and enhance customer lifestyles, which will ultimately lead to better served customers. As the Group has a strong financial position with good liquidity, management will continue to deliver value for shareholders. The Group will maintain a policy of selectively and continuously replenishing its land bank both in Hong Kong and China, which will enable it to strengthen earnings and profitability. In terms of property development and property management, the Group will incorporate more environmentally friendly elements and initiatives in projects, such as measures to reduce carbon emissions so residents and tenants can enjoy a better environment and healthier lifestyles. The Directors are confident in the medium to long term prospects of the Group.
