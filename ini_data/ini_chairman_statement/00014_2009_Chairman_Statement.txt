Chairman s Statement 
Hong Kong maintained steady growth during the first half of 2008 despite growing concerns about the global economy. The second half of the year saw a marked worsening of the global environment, with the international financial system experiencing severe strain in the fourth quarter. Hong Kong s financial markets were adversely affected, with the impact being felt in the real local economy.
Good Operating Performance and Strong Balance Sheet Against this background, Hysan achieved another year of good operating performance in our core leasing business. The Group s 2008 turnover was HK$1,638 million, an increase of 19.7% from 2007. Office sector turnover growth was 24.0%, while Retail followed closely at 20.4% and Residential at 11.5%.
Recurring Underlying Profit, the key measurement of our core business performance, was HK$1,066 million, up 12.2% from HK$950 million in 2007. This reflected our more prudent financial investment strategy in light of market conditions. Earnings per share based on Recurring Underlying Profit correspondingly rose to HK102.57 cents (2007: HK90.32 cents).
Underlying Profit, which excludes unrealised changes in fair value of investment properties and related deferred tax, was HK$1,201 million (2007: HK$1,158 million). Year 2007 recorded substantial gains derived from the disposal of long-term securities.
Statutory Profit was HK$1,594 million (2007: HK$3,949 million). This reflected the impact of 
We maintained a strong balance sheet, with improved net interest coverage (2008: 10.2 times; 2007: 7.8 times) and net debt to equity ratios (2008: 5.9%; 2007: 6.8%) signifying the Group s 
The external valuation of the Group s investment property portfolio was HK$35,850 million, a slight rise from HK$35,711 million in 2007. Adjusted shareholders funds were HK$34,660 million (2007: HK$35,072 million).
The Board of Directors recommends the payment of a final dividend of HK54.0 cents per share (2007: HK48.0 cents). Together with the interim dividend of HK14.0 cents per share (2007: HK12.0 cents), there is an aggregate distribution of HK68.0 cents per share, representing a year- on-year increase of 13.3%. Subject to shareholder approval, the final dividend will be payable in cash with a scrip dividend alternative.

Building for the Future These are challenging times. However, with a strong balance sheet as our platform, we aim to maintain our focus on building the future of our property investment business. Our strengthened management team will enable us to continue to provide high quality products and services to tenants and visitors alike.
We also took further steps to strengthen our internal controls and risk management. These measures are further described elsewhere in this year s Annual Report.
The development of 500 Hennessy Road, the future northern gateway of our community in Causeway Bay, is in good progress. We believe this building will remain competitive for a long time to come. Environmental sustainability, in particular, has been a key focus of our design and 
Directors and Staff I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere thanks to Pauline Wong, who retired from the Company during the year, having served the Board since 1991. I would also like to thank all our staff members for their dedication and hard work during the year.

The global economic outlook will remain negative in 2009, and Hong Kong s real economy is to be further impacted. Hysan will inevitably be affected by the overall environment. However, the longer-term contractual nature of our core leasing business, and our balanced tenant base with no undue dependence on any particular business sector, mean that we should be more resilient during these challenging times.
