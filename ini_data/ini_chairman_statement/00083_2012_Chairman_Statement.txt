(3) Property Development (Continued) 
Subsequent to the financial year ended 30th June, 2012, the Occupation Permit for The Coronation was issued by the Building Authority of the HKSAR Government in August 2012.

The Group will strive to improve its developments by use of environmentally friendly features. Environmental sustainability is an important guiding principle in the Group s project development.

(4) Rental Activities 
For the financial year ended 30th June, 2012, the Group s gross rental revenue, including attributable share from associates, increased 11.1% to HK$2,936.0 million (20102011: HK$2,642.4 million) and net rental income increased 13.6% to HK$2,541.5 million (20102011: HK$2,238.0 million).
The increase in rental revenue was mainly due to higher rental rates on renewals, as well as improvement in occupancy levels of the existing rental portfolio for the financial year 20112012.

Supported by leasing demand for retail spaces from international and local retailers, the retail properties in Hong Kong have generated rental growth throughout the financial year. This continued growth was mainly attributable to the increase in domestic consumption due to household formation, wealth creation in China as well as growth in visitor arrivals over the years. The appreciation of several key Asian currencies against the Hong Kong dollar has also had a favourable impact on the retail sector in Hong Kong. HKSAR Government s efforts in promoting Hong Kong as one of the key shopping destinations in Asia are also positive for the retail sector.
Occupancy rates of the Group s shopping centres have been maintained at

CHAIRMAN S STATEMENT (Continued) 
(4) Rental Activities (Continued) 
The changes in global business environment and market trend have had impact on the demand for office spaces in Hong Kong. An increasing number of multinational companies and international brands have been looking for alternative office locations for expansion or operational efficiency. HKSAR Government s policy to develop Kowloon East as a new core business district has transformed the landscape of the office sector in Hong Kong. While certain areas on Hong Kong Island still remain key commercial areas for Grade A offices, Kowloon East is developing into a new hub and a desirable location for a broader range of businesses. The expansion of international retailers in China translates into additional demand for Hong Kong office space and these new sources of demand will provide support to the sector. The Group s office rental portfolio has shown improvements in occupancy rates during the year under review.

The industrial leasing market in Hong Kong has gained momentum since the start of the year mainly due to growth of the retail and office sectors as well as demand from e-commerce. Along with the HKSAR Government s measures to revitalise the traditional industrial districts allowing some industrial buildings to be converted into offices, more multinational enterprises are attracted to relocate their factories and offices to these areas. The occupancy rates of the Group s industrial portfolio have been maintained at high levels for the financial year.

Regular asset enhancement programmes are integral to the Group s effort to raise asset quality, property values and rental revenues. These programmes include refurbishment and renovation of properties, developing marketing and promotional events, improving service quality, reconfiguring the layouts of premises with the right trade mix, to meet the needs of tenants and customers. By making these improvements, the shopping experience of our customers can be enhanced and tenants can benefit from a sustained flow of shoppers, which will bring more business to our tenants and enhance the value of the Group s investment properties.

As at 30th June, 2012, the Group has approximately 11.4 million square feet of attributable gross floor area of investment properties and hotels.
Of this portfolio, commercial developments (retail and office) account for 64.9%, industrial developments 14.3%, car parks 12.9%, hotels 6.2%, and

CHAIRMAN S STATEMENT (Continued) 
(6) China Business 
China s economy has been going through economic adjustments, both cyclically and structurally, as Central Government continues to introduce measures to stabilise growth and implement structural reforms in areas of banking and finance, housing, services and manufacturing to bring about a sustainable economic development. This development will help build a resilient economic system that reduces China s vulnerability to global markets and business cycles. Continuous attempts to improve and develop a more effective fiscal and monetary framework will also help to mitigate the risk of economic shocks, especially at a time when there are economic uncertainties in Europe.

After three decades of industrialization, the economic landscape of China has been changing gradually, moving towards a better business environment with enterprises pursuing quality management, products and services, branding and technological innovation and advancement. Recent economic data in China showed a softening in growth in the first half of calendar year 2012. To revive the growth momentum, Central Government has taken proactive policy easing to accelerate investments in infrastructure and industries, and increase liquidity in the economic system with monetary measures by lowering both interest rates and banks required reserve ratio.

Residential property market in China is an integral part of Central Government s urbanization, population and social policies which will help support consumption-led growth in the medium to long term. Developing social and private housing will cater to the needs of different income- groups; improve productivity and reduce social discontentment. Housing measures implemented by the Central Government in recent years are conducive to establishing a healthier and sustainable property market.
These measures will also bring about a better distribution of income and narrow the wealth disparity gap. Demand for residential property in China is expected to continue to grow due to urbanisation, household formation, preference for home-ownership and investment in real estate assets as a preservation of value.

Throughout the years, the Group has completed a number of projects in Xiamen and Fuzhou. The Group s interest in the commercial project Raffles City Shanghai located in the central business district of Shanghai and the leasing of Sino International Plaza in Fuzhou have established its presence in these cities. The experience gained from developing and leasing projects in China has also built the Group s execution capability in the country.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 
Dedicated to promoting local art and culture and enriching the daily lives of Hong Kong people, the Group initiated Sino Art (formerly Art in Hong Kong ) in 2006.
The programme organises art exhibitions and activities at various properties of the Group. By providing local and international artists and arts groups with more platforms and opportunities to showcase their visual, community and performing arts talents, Sino Art aims to add vigour to a more creative and culturally vibrant Hong Kong. In 20112012, Sino Art collaborated with shopping malls of the Group and acclaimed artists to host interesting exhibitions, bringing an element of inspiration to the daily lives of the general public. Additionally, Sino Art has also collaborated with the Hong Kong Museum of History for the first time to present Transformation of the Qipao , promoting the unique Chinese cultural and artistic legacy of the qipao.

In March 2008, the Ng family, the ultimate major shareholder of the Group, set up a non-profit organisation named Hong Kong Heritage Conservation Foundation ( HCF ). In December 2008, HCF was fortunate to win the tender to revitalise and convert the Old Tai O Police Station into a boutique hotel. Named Tai O Heritage Hotel, it is home to nine colonial-style rooms and suites which commenced operation in March this year.

The financial year 20112012 was a challenging year for policy makers, businesses and financial sectors around the globe. The economic conditions in the Euro zone have had wide-spread effects across industries and countries. Given the complexity of the national debt issues and the number of nations involved, a significant amount of resources, efforts and time are needed to bring the economies back on their growth tracks. The economy of the Euro zone is expected to be soft for a period of time.

In the United States, the economy is on a course of recovery despite mixed signals from the economic data. Federal Reserve s accommodative stance for monetary policy will be conducive to support the growth momentum. With global economic conditions remaining volatile, the year ahead is expected to remain uncertain.

China has been developing its own model to manage its economy for counteracting cyclical trends and structural changes to stabilize growth. The easing of economic growth in the first two quarters of this calendar year was anticipated by policy makers because of the policy shift from the last three decades of export-led growth to consumption-led growth. Central Government s approach in exercising reforms in the areas of banking and housing will lead to a better allocation of resources and distribution of income.

Sino Group established Sino Caring Friends to encourage staff to regularly participate in various volunteer and charity programmes.

Sino Land Company Limited Annual Report 2012 
CHAIRMAN S STATEMENT (Continued) 
The Hong Kong residential property market has been supported by economic and demographic fundamentals. The resilient local economic environment is evident by stable employment, subdue inflation, growth in the retail sector and continued growth in visitor arrivals have provided a good platform for the sector to grow.
The increase in household formation and the number of marriages and births have created new demand for housing. The home buyers continue to benefit from the low mortgage interest rates and good liquidity from the banking sector. Not only does the low interest rate environment make mortgage loan repayment more affordable, home owners can earn a positive return by leasing their flats.

The HKSAR Government s policy to develop a balanced mix of public rental housing, Home Ownership Scheme and private housing, will address the housing needs of different income groups. The regular land sales initiated by the HKSAR Government, Land Application List System, and the supply of sites from the Mass Transit Railway Corporation and Urban Renewal Authority of Hong Kong will maintain a continuous supply of sites for residential development. The HKSAR Government has indicated that there will be more land made available for private housing development. The Group with its cash resources is well positioned to participate on this opportunity to acquire land with good development value.

Although global market conditions are unclear, the Group is cautiously optimistic on the prospects for its business and operating conditions to grow. With favourable sales from a number of residential projects during the financial year, the Group has the strength and resources to pursue further investments in the property business. The Group will continue to optimise earnings, enhance efficiency and productivity and improve the quality of products and services. The Group will maintain a policy of selectively and continuously replenishing its land bank and is well placed to participate in future land acquisitions.
