Sino Land s investment property portfolio primarily serves the need of its customers which include tenants, shoppers and the communities around the properties. The design and conditions of the properties together with the quality of service provided to customers are of paramount importance.
To ensure that the properties are in good condition with the proper layout and design, Sino Land would perform regular review of the properties and collect customers feedback to decide if asset enhancement work is required. To assess the effectiveness of capital expenditure, benefits to customers, payback and return on investment will be analysed. On service quality, Sino Land places a strong emphasis on regular training particularly for all front-line staff to ensure that the service provided to customers meet their expectations. Comments from customers, reports by silent shoppers and recognitions from professional institutions all play a role in assessing the quality of service delivered by the staff. These indicators are vital for management to review what additional work needs to be done as part of Sino Land s efforts for continuous improvement.
As at 30th June, 2015, Sino Land has approximately 11.5 million square feet of attributable floor area of investment properties and hotels in Hong Kong, China and Singapore.

Overall business performance of Sino Land s hotels, namely The Fullerton Hotel, The Fullerton Bay Hotel and Conrad Hong Kong was slightly affected by soft demand and competitive business environment during the financial year 20142015. Sino Land will continue to improve the quality of its hotel services to ensure our discerning guests have enjoyable experiences during their stays in the hotels.

REVIEW OF OPERATIONS 
(6) China Business The economic and social reforms in China have been progressing well.
Liberalisation of the financial market is underway with fiscal policy and public finance reviewed and improved to cater to the needs of the local governments. Capital controls have also been relaxed. Reforms on household-registration system and social services are being studied to reduce inequalities both between cities and between urban and rural areas. Environmental protection initiatives have been addressed. The Central Government has taken steps to roll out various policies to integrate its economy with the rest of the world and China is increasingly taking a bigger role in the world economy while pursuing a more balanced and high quality economic growth. All the policies combined will make China a more resilient economy resulting in an improvement in the livelihoods 
During the financial year 20142015, the property market in China turned active with improvement in sales volume, pricing and lower inventory levels mainly due to relaxation of home purchase restrictions in most cities in China and monetary easing which included reduction of interest rates, abolishment of loan-to-deposit ratio for banks and an increase in the availability of mortgage loans for home purchasers which is favourable for the property market.
Sino Land has four projects in China mainly for residential developments with a total of approximately 21.2 million square feet of attributable plot ratio area. These projects are situated in cities with good economic and demographic fundamentals. Sino Land s property developments in China, namely The Palazzo in Chengdu, The Coronation in Chongqing, Dynasty Park in Zhangzhou and Mayfair By The Lake in Xiamen will be sold and completed in the next few years.

Dedicated to promoting arts and culture to enrich the everyday lives of Hong Kong people, Sino Land initiated Sino Art in 2006, under which Sino Art provides local and international artists with opportunities to showcase their works through exhibitions and public art installations at the Sino Land s properties. With the launch of Sino Art in Community in 2013, Sino Land has extended its reach into community facilities such as hospitals, kindergartens and children s homes, where local artists create community art together with the underprivileged, children and educators.
Sino Heritage was established in 2011 with the belief that conservation of cultural heritage helps the community build a sense of identity and strengthen relationships in the city. Sino Heritage identifies and showcases the heritage significance of historical projects in both Hong Kong and Singapore. In March 2008, the Ng Teng Fong Family, the major shareholder of the Group, set up a non-profit-making organisation, Hong Kong Heritage Conservation Foundation Limited ( HCF ). HCF revitalised and converted the Old Tai O Police Station, a Grade II historic building, into a boutique hotel. Named Tai O Heritage Hotel ( Hotel ), it is home to nine colonial-style rooms and suites and commenced operation in March 2012. The Hotel, operated by HCF as a non-profit-making social enterprise, is part of the HKSAR Government s Revitalising Historic Buildings Through Partnership Scheme .
HCF is an award winner at UNESCO Asia-Pacific 2013 Awards for Cultural Heritage Conservation. In November 2014, HCF has been honoured by the American Institute of Architects Hong Kong Chapter with a Citation Award, in recognition of its contributions to heritage conservation in Hong Kong.
PROSPECTS The US economy continues to be on the path of recovery with improvement in GDP, consumer sentiment, personal consumption expenditure and housing sector activity as well as lower level of unemployment. In the Euro zone, the economic situation has been improving, helped by the decrease in oil price and depreciation of Euro as well as the quantitative-easing programme by the European Central Bank rolled out in March this year.
In China, the Central Government published in March 2015 its first edition of written framework of Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road also known as One Belt One Road . One Belt One Road will foster economic ties spanning different regions in Asia, Europe and Africa. It will promote co-development and multilateral co-operation in the areas of economic, finance, transport, environmental protection, tourism, technology and education as well as bring in prosperity to the nations along the regions. The economic development along One Belt One Road will provide entrepreneurs, professionals and skillful workers in Hong Kong the opportunity to offer their services in the regions.

Over the past year, Central Government has continued its efforts to open up its economy and prepare itself for globalization. In October 2014, China spearheaded the launch of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank with the objective to finance the development of infrastructure and other productive sectors in Asia. In November 2014, the trading through Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect commenced which should help expand and integrate the financial and capital markets in China and Hong Kong. In April 2015, China opened three more Free Trade Zones in Guangdong, Fujian and Tianjin in addition to the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone. The Free Trade Zone in Guangdong covers areas in Guangzhou, Zhuhai, Qianhai and Shekou which will benefit trade and finance in Hong Kong as a whole.
The Hong Kong property market has been going through a period of change as a result of economic and property-related policies. During the financial year 20142015, buying sentiment improved and primary transaction volume saw favourable growth. The growth was predominantly driven by good demand and availability of new project launches. The Long-term Housing Strategy Committee released on 15th December, 2014 a comprehensive plan for housing supply in the next ten years to balance housing demand and supply and is conducive to maintaining stability of the Hong Kong property market. Sino Land, with a good mix of residential projects to be launched for sale in the next 12 months, will benefit from the prevailing market conditions.
Further, Sino Land s resilient recurrent businesses, which comprise property leasing, hospitality and property management services, continue to contribute stable stream of income. With a good financial position, Sino Land is well- positioned to respond to challenges ahead.
Management will continue to optimise earnings, enhance efficiency and productivity and improve the quality of products and services. In respect of property development and property management, Sino Land will incorporate more environmentally friendly elements in our projects. Sino Land will maintain a policy of selectively and continuously replenishing its land bank, which will enable it to strengthen earnings and shareholders value.
STAFF AND MANAGEMENT On behalf of the Board, I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation to all staff for their commitment, dedication and continuing support. I would also like to express my gratitude to my fellow Directors for their guidance and wise counsel.
