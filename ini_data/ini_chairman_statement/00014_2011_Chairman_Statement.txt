Chairman s Statement 
The economy of Hong Kong saw its recovery taking shape in 2010, despite uncertainties in global economies including the United States and Europe. Core district Grade A office rental levels and occupancy both saw improvements from the market troughs experienced during 2009. Local retail sales continued to perform well, reflecting better consumer sentiment and a remarkable inflow of tourists from the Mainland. These factors helped to create a positive environment for retail rental growth.

The Group s 2010 turnover was HK$1,764 million, an increase of 5.0% from HK$1,680 million in 2009. Growth was recorded across our core leasing business. The retail sector recorded 8.0% turnover growth, while that of the office sector was 3.1%. The residential sector s turnover increase was 3.2%. The office sector saw occupancy improving to 95%, while the retail sector was virtually fully let except for those Leighton Centre retail units that were being renovated. The residential sector occupancy was at 94%.
Recurring Underlying Profit, the key measurement of our core leasing business performance, was HK$1,148 million, an increase of 3.4% from HK$1,110 million in 2009. Our Underlying Profit, which excludes unrealised changes in fair value of investment properties, was also HK$1,148 million, an increase of 3.1% from HK$1,113 million in 2009 when some gains from disposal of long-term assets were recorded. These figures reflected the improvement in gross profit generated from our core leasing activities. Basic earnings per share based on Recurring Underlying Profit correspondingly rose to HK109.15 cents (2009: 
Statutory Profit, prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, was HK$3,844 million (2009: HK$2,914 million 1 ), mainly due to the higher valuation of the Group s investment properties. The external valuation of the Group s investment property portfolio increased to HK$40,833 million, an increase of 9.3% from HK$37,363 million in 2009. Shareholders funds also rose by 9.3% to HK$40,677 million (2009: HK$37,216 million 1 ).
Our financial position remains strong, with improved net interest coverage of 14.0 times (2009: 11.7 times) and net debt to equity ratio of 6.4% (2009: 5.1%).
The Board of Directors (the Board ) recommends the payment of a final dividend of HK60 cents per share (2009: HK54 cents). Together with the interim dividend of HK14 cents per share (2009: HK14 cents), there is an aggregate distribution of HK74 cents per share, representing a year-on-year increase of 8.8%. Subject to shareholder approval, the final dividend will be payable in cash with a scrip dividend alternative.
Platform for Growth Year 2010 was a year of progress for Hysan. Despite challenges in the economic environment at the beginning of the year, we achieved our near-term objectives of improving occupancy and revenue. They were achieved through making our locations more attractive and by better understanding our customers and meeting their needs. Hysan Place, our latest development project, is on schedule for a grand opening in the second quarter of 2012.
The completion of the project will bring Hysan to another level in terms of commercial success, design and sustainability. Together, we are building a platform for growth to further enhance Hysan s longer-term competitiveness.
Board and People I have served this Board for over 20 years and shall step down at the conclusion of the May Annual General Meeting. I am pleased to announce that Irene Yun Lien LEE, who brings with her extensive corporate and commercial experience, has been appointed the new non-executive Chairman to take over from me. Deanna Ruth Tak Yung LEE RUDGARD has also decided to step down in May, having served the Board for 18 years. Siu Chuen LAU, who has served as her alternate, will join as a new non-executive Director.
I would like to thank my fellow Board members for their steadfast contribution to the Group and their fellowship to me throughout the years. My special thanks to Fa-Kuang HU and Geoffrey YEH, who stepped down during the year, for their wise counsel throughout their long tenure. I would also like to welcome our new directors who will bring fresh perspectives to the Board to help map our future direction. Finally, I should like to express my heartfelt thanks to the management team and all our staff members for their support, their dedication and their hard work.

We expect Grade A office rentals in the core districts to continue to improve during the year. Against this background, we shall be renewing leases negotiated during the 2008 rental peak. The retail segment should continue to benefit from good retail sales and inbound tourists. Our performance is expected to experience steady growth as a whole.
