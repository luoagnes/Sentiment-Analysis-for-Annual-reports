The global economy is clouded with uncertainties last year and in early 2012. The sovereign debts position in Europe and the slow recovery progress of the United States are all factors potentially leading to significant market fluctuation. The Board believes that 2012 will be a year in which challenges and opportunities will co-exist.
Facing the global uncertainties as stated above, there are still positive demands for quality residential properties in Hong Kong, Macau and the Mainland China. The Group is confident and optimistic in these markets.
To capture these demands, the Group continues launching One WanChai in Hong Kong; The Metropolis and Splendid City in Chengdu. In addition, the new development project in Macau, namely La Scala will also be launched in 2012.
Our core retail investment properties are all located in prime shopping areas. The ONE, for instance, will continue to be the landmark for local customers and tourists. Windsor House and Silvercord will also enjoy benefits from the continuous growth in arrivals and spending of tourists from Mainland China. The Group s retail rental income would continue to be positive. Meanwhile, River Court, the Group s investment in London, will continue making contributions through stable return.
In view of the performance of securities investments last year and the challenges in the global economic environment in the year ahead, the Board would continue its policy in maintaining a higher cash reserve in 2012. Apart from sale of development properties in Hong Kong, Macau and the Mainland China according to development schedules and progress, the Group would also consider sale of particular investment property (or property interests held by the Group) in Hong Kong or the Mainland China or securities investment when such disposal is beneficial to the Group and its shareholders as a whole.

I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the shareholders for their continued support. I would also like to express my sincere thanks to my fellow directors and all staff members for their dedication and hard work.
