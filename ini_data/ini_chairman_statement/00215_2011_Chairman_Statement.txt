While successfully pursuing a carefully-considered strategy of achieving turnover growth of 17%, the Group also focused on controlling costs. Total operating expenses of the Group, excluding cost of inventories sold, were HK$6,997 million in 2010, a slight increase compared to HK$6,906 million in 2009.
Staff costs of HK$646 million in 2010 were in line with HK$644 million in 2009. Depreciation and amortisation decreased by 16% to HK$1,087 million in 2010 from HK$1,288 million in 2009 mainly due to a change in the estimated useful lives of various categories of 2G network equipment in Hong Kong. Other operating expenses increased by 6% to HK$5,264 million in 2010 from HK$4,974 million in 2009 due to increased activities. Cost of inventories sold increased to HK$1,776 million in 2010 from HK$756 million in 2009 which was in line with growing sales of smartphones.
Interest and other finance costs in 2010 decreased by 30% to HK$128 million compared to HK$184 million in 2009 mainly due to lower borrowings.
As a result of solid business growth in 2010, profit attributable to shareholders of the Company was HK$755 million compared to HK$468 million in 2009, representing an increase of 61%.

The Group has maintained clear leadership, in terms of our overall subscription in Hong Kong, and has become the second largest mobile operator in Macau. The strong positioning of our customer base has enabled us to capitalise on increasingly aggressive smartphone penetration and the rising number of mobile data users.
Accelerating the exploitation of this mobile data growth in 2010, the Group launched successful marketing campaigns, expanded network coverage and capability, developed value-for-money tariff plans and co-operated with high-profile content providers in order to develop a distinctive customer experience. The Group is well positioned to take advantage of further anticipated migration into smartphone usage, which will generate demand for data services, bandwidth-consuming applications and higher

Our consumer broadband sales activities increased during 2010, harnessing the power of the 3 brand to market residential fixed-line services.

Executing a well-planned international business strategy, HGC has established itself as a globally-recognised and preferred telecommunications operator among international carriers, Internet service providers and multinational corporations alike at home and overseas.
In Hong Kong, continued development of backbone transmission capability has strengthened our ability to serve both local and overseas operators into a new era of broadband technology.
HGC also manages the large-scale needs of the banking and finance sectors with solutions based on leading-edge technologies. Introduction of the MetroLambda service has facilitated an increasing number of high-bandwidth applications, which serve to promote reliability and save costs.

After achieving strong results in 2010, the Group has moved forward by capitalising on increasing demand for mobile data. At the same time, the Group has further enhanced the overall customer experience by upgrading network capacity and capability through 3G infrastructure modernisation, while offering a variety of smartphone models, plus exclusive applications. A successful bid for 900MHz radio spectrum paves the way for establishing a better foundation for high-speed data services. Our leadership will be further reinforced by a planned LTE service rollout later in 2011.
The Group is focusing on deeper penetration in the fixed-line consumer market with services of download speed up to 1,000Mbps, while boosting customer loyalty and developing stronger retention initiatives. The Group is making full use of Hong Kong s status as a fixed-line regional hub in order to expand around the region, while broadening its service portfolio and increasing the value of its offering to diverse customer groups. Following years of investment, the Group has achieved substantial market share across a range of business segments. The Group will build on this success by continuing a segmentation strategy and developing comprehensive solutions tailored to customers specific needs on a sector-by-sector basis.
Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the Board and all staff members for their dedication, professionalism and determination to succeed.
