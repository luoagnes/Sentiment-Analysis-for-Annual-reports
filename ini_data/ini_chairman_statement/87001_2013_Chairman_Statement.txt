DISTRIBUTION REINVESTMENT ARRANGEMENT The Manager recommends that a distribution reinvestment arrangement be made available to Unitholders, subject to obtaining authorisation from the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong ( SFC ) of relevant documents.
Under the distribution reinvestment arrangement, eligible Unitholders will be entitled to have a scrip distribution in lieu of a cash distribution. Eligible Unitholders can elect to receive their distribution in the form of cash, or in the form of new Units of Hui Xian REIT, or a combination of both. Subject to the SFC s authorisation, an announcement providing further information on the distribution reinvestment arrangement will be published and a circular containing the relevant details together with the relevant election form will be sent to all qualifi ed Unitholders.
UNIT PRICE PERFORMANCE Hui Xian REIT s unit price has been trending upwards during the Reporting Period. The closing unit price of RMB 4.15 on 31 December 2012 was an increase of 16.6% from RMB 3.56 a year ago.
RMB DEVELOPMENT IN HONG KONG Hui Xian REIT is the fi rst RMB-denominated REIT listed in Hong Kong as well as outside Mainland China. Its performance has a high correlation with the progress of RMB development.

Hong Kong has successfully developed into the premier offshore RMB centre in the world over the past few years. It hosts the largest pool of RMB liquidity outside Mainland China. In December 2012, offshore RMB deposits in Hong Kong reached RMB 600 billion.
More diversifi ed RMB investment products were introduced in the Hong Kong fi nancial market during 2012, paving the way for wider investments for the growing RMB pool in Hong Kong and for the further development of a healthy and sustainable RMB market. It is anticipated that Hui Xian REIT s liquidity would increase when more RMB investment products are available in the fi nancial market.
RMB value has been strengthening over the past several years, particularly in the second half of 2012. The exchange rate of RMB against the Hong Kong Dollar has appreciated about 1.1% # during the Reporting Period.

Taking into account a total DPU of RMB 0.2392, together with a 16.6% increase in unit price and a 1.1% appreciation in RMB exchange rate during the Reporting Period, Hui Xian REIT delivered to Unitholders a total return of 24.6% in 
CHINA BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT The economic drivers in China remained intact despite the weak and uncertain global economic conditions. China s economy maintained the growth momentum in 2012 and the full-year gross domestic product ( GDP ) increased 7.8% year-on-year to RMB 51.9 trillion. Total retail sales of consumer goods and industrial production in 2012 grew 14.3% and 10.0% year-on-year respectively.
Beijing, the country s political and economic centre, recorded encouraging economic fi gures in 2012. The capital city s GDP rose 7.7% year-on-year to RMB 1.8 trillion, about 3.4% of China s GDP. Business activities and tourism continued to grow, which in turn drove up demand for Grade A offi ce space as well as fi ve-star international hotel 
In 2012, the average disposable income per capita of Beijing urban residents increased 10.8% year-on-year according to offi cial data. A number of international and local retailers, ranging from luxury products, fast fashion to food and beverage chains, were keen to tap this huge market of increasing consumer spending. Retail sales of Beijing in 2012 were also 11.6% higher than the previous year, signaling a healthy growth in domestic consumption.

Hui Xian REIT s diversifi ed portfolio spans across retail, offi ce, serviced apartment and hotel businesses. During the Reporting Period, its properties under management consisted of the 800,000 square metre mixed-use development Oriental Plaza (comprising The Malls, The Tower Offi ces, The Tower Apartments and Grand Hyatt Beijing) and Sheraton Shenyang Lido Hotel, a fi ve-star hotel in Shenyang. Total revenue and net property income of 2012 were RMB 2,648 million and 1,671 million respectively. The appraised value of Hui Xian REIT s properties was RMB 37,850 million as at 31 December 2012.

* Sheraton Shenyang Lido Hotel has become a part of Hui Xian REIT s portfolio since 1 January 2012.

Beijing s retail market was active in 2012. Many international retailers were eager to capture the opportunities in the enormous China consumption market.
Leasing momentum at The Malls at Oriental Plaza remained strong. During the year, we have carried out asset enhancement works and tenant mix refi nement exercises to capitalise on the business opportunities arising from the fast-changing retail environment.
The average monthly passing rent continued its upward trend and increased 8.1% year-on-year to RMB 940 per square metre. Rental reversion was 25.8%. The average occupancy rate for 2012 was 97.5%. Net property income was RMB 746 million.
Offi ce Portfolio Beijing, the capital of China, remained a preferred city for international and domestic corporations, as well as overseas government bodies to establish their headquarters or regional quarters. We continued to see an imbalance between supply and demand for high quality offi ces in Beijing, which was the key driver for rental growth in 2012.
The average monthly passing rent of The Tower Offi ces at Oriental Plaza grew 15.2% year-on-year to RMB 194 per square metre. The average monthly spot rent increased 30.0% year-on-year to RMB 314 per square metre. Rental reversion was 68.4%. The average occupancy rate for 2012 was 93.5%. Net property income of our offi ce sector was RMB 568 million.
Serviced Apartment Portfolio Leasing momentum for luxury serviced apartments in Beijing remained strong in 2012, primarily driven by the continued demand from the increasing pool of senior executives from both multinational and domestic corporations.
The Tower Apartments at Oriental Plaza, providing over 600 furnished units in two towers, experienced encouraging rental growth in 2012. The average occupancy rate for 2012 was 87.0%. Net property income was RMB 60 million.

During the Reporting Period, our hotel portfolio consisted of two fi ve-star hotels: Grand Hyatt Beijing at Oriental Plaza and Sheraton Shenyang Lido Hotel. Net property income of two hotels combined was RMB 297 million.
During 2012, Grand Hyatt Beijing s average room rate per night increased 5.7% year-on-year to RMB 1,840. Revenue per available room ( RevPAR ) was RMB 1,148. The average occupancy rate for 2012 was 62.4%. The three-year asset enhancement programme to upgrade the guest rooms has commenced.
In addition to Grand Hyatt Beijing, the 590-room Sheraton Shenyang Lido Hotel has been integrated into Hui Xian REIT s hotel portfolio since 1 January 2012. The average room rate per night increased 4.3% year-on-year to RMB 821. RevPAR was RMB 522. The average occupancy rate for 2012 was 63.6%.
Both hotels have been named Best Business Hotel in their respective cities in 2012. Grand Hyatt Beijing received Best Business Hotel in Beijing award by Business Traveller Asia Pacifi c Magazine for the seventh time. Sheraton Shenyang Lido Hotel was named Best Business Hotel in Shenyang by Business Traveller China Magazine. This is the sixth consecutive year the hotel has been awarded this accolade.
As the management contract with Sheraton ended on 31 December 2012, the Manager appointed France s Sofi tel Luxury Hotels as the new hotel manager. The hotel was renamed Sofi tel Shenyang Lido on 1 January 2013.
STRONG FINANCIAL POSITION Hui Xian REIT maintained a healthy balance sheet during the Reporting Period. As at 31 December 2012, bank balances and cash on hand amounted to RMB 2,063 million and gross debts amounted to RMB 1,964 million. Debts to gross asset value ratio was 5.0%. We believe that Hui Xian REIT has strong fi nancial capacity to pursue investment opportunities when they occur.

Looking ahead to 2013, we are committed to driving organic growth from our assets through astute asset management. Our priorities are to achieve rental growth, as well as to maintain high occupancy levels for all of our four business sectors: retail, offi ce, serviced apartment and hotel. This would provide us with the security of a strong and sustainable rental income.
We will continue to implement the asset enhancement programmes for Grand Hyatt Beijing and The Malls at Oriental Plaza in 2013. A renovation programme has also been initiated for Sofi tel Shenyang Lido.
As we are actively seeking acquisition opportunities in China, we remain of the view that it is crucial to adopt a prudent selection strategy when pursuing quality and yield-accretive assets that are to bring long-term benefi ts for Hui Xian REIT and Unitholders.

The positive GDP performance and other economic data indicate that China s economy remains strong and the upward momentum is expected to continue in 2013. We fi rmly believe that China s economic fundamentals are sound and it will maintain the position as the key engine of global economic growth. We are confi dent that Hui Xian REIT, with its high quality portfolio in excellent locations, solid track record, and expertise, is well positioned to capitalise on China s bright prospects.
On behalf of the Manager, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Trustee and Unitholders for their continued support and confi dence in Hui Xian REIT.
