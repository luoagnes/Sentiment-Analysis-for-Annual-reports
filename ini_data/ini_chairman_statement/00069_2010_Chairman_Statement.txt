CHAIRMAN S STATEMENT 2009 On behalf of the Board I am pleased to present the Annual Report of Shangri-La Asia Limited covering the financial year 2009.
2009 started on a weak note with most of our hotels operating at lower occupancy levels and reduced revenues when compared to the previous year.
Overall visitor arrivals and travel spending in the region remained depressed throughout the first half of the year, as was also the case for meetings, incentives and entertainment activities resulting in a significant drop in food and beverage revenues. However towards the middle of Q3 and up to the end of the year our hotels benefited from a pick up in the leisure and business travel sector across the region whilst our food and beverage outlets benefited from the increase spending by the domestic sector.
Group revenue declined in 2009 to US$1,230,033,000 (2008: US$1,353,271,000) despite the opening of 5 new hotels: S La Tokyo, S La Boracay, S La Maldives, S La Wenzhou and S La Ningbo. As a result of lower occupancies in most of our hotels and coupled with the start up losses incurred by new hotels that opened in the past two years, operating profit dropped to US$51,348,000 (2008: US$163,165,000) underscoring the severity of the weak economy in the first nine months of the year.
There were significant exceptional items in 2009 s financial statements mostly attributable to fair value gains of investment properties in several of our subsidiaries and associate companies amounting to US$271.3 million as well as provisions for impairment losses on S La Tokyo and the aborted S La New York project totaling some US$59.8 million. After accounting for exceptional items, net profit attributable to shareholders in 2009 registered US$255.5 million (2008: 
Earnings per share amounted to US8.89 cents per share (2008: US5.76 cents per 
A final dividend of HK$0.06 per ordinary share has been proposed for FY 2009.
Together with the interim dividend of HK$0.06 per ordinary share the total dividend for FY2009 will be HK$0.12 per ordinary share.
The Group operated 65 hotels at the end of 2009 with equity invested in 47 hotels, 1 under operating lease and 17 hotels under management. As a result of the severe credit tightening by banks, the three projects under management in Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles stalled due to a lack of funding and we elected to withdraw from these projects.
The first two months in 2010 has seen marked improvements in operating performance in many of our hotels compared to the same period last year and whilst forward bookings across the Group remain healthy, there continues to be uncertainty in the outlook for the second half of the year.
We have opened one hotel (S La Guilin) so far this year and plan to open another 4 hotels by the end of 2010.
The subsequent 3 to 4 years will see the addition of another 35 new hotels, of which half will be equity invested and half under management. These additions will add 26 new destinations in the Asia Pacific, China, Canada, Europe and Central Asia to the existing 53 cities in which the Group currently operates.
Apart from the development of our new hotels, the Group will continue to build on our Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives with particular focus on assisting and supporting projects that benefit the communities in which we operate. I am very pleased to see the enthusiastic engagement of our staff in these Corporate Social Responsibility programmes.
I would like to thank the Management and staff for their enduring hard work and dedication throughout what has been a most challenging year for the Group. I also wish to thank my fellow Board members for their valuable guidance and support
