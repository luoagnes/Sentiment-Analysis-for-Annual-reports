STATEMENT FROM CHAIRMAN 
The economic environment, both abroad and domestic, continued to struggle with great volatility since the beginning of 2015, creating additional hardship for the already weak consumer retail market in China. Under a backdrop of slower economic growth and increasing structural difficulties, consumer sentiment continued to be weak. In the mean time, with fast changing consumer behavior and preferences, most traditional channels as well as retailers have difficulties in terms of foot traffic and sales productivity. Except for the lone bright spot in sportswear sector, the fashion apparel, footwear and accessory sectors are mostly faced with enormous challenges of slow growth and margin erosion.
The Group continued to observe a divergence of performance between the footwear division and the sportswear and apparel division. The sportswear and apparel business, after substantial corrections during the previous four to five years, now benefits from real growth in consumer demand, which translates into healthy revenue growth and enhanced profitability. The footwear business, on the other hand, suffers from diluted foot traffic and shifting consumer preference, which results in continued same store sales decline and lower 
For the year ended 29 February 2016 (the Financial Year 201516 ) the footwear business recorded a revenue decline of 8.5%, compared with last year, while the sportswear and apparel business recorded revenue growth of 16.2%. Overall revenue increased by 2.0%. Operating profits decreased by 32.2%. Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company decreased by 38.4%.
Company-managed retail network of the Group was largely stable. In the Financial Year 201516, there was a net reduction of 366 company-managed retail outlets for the footwear business, and a net addition of 682 company-managed retail outlets for the sportswear and apparel business. As at 29 February 2016, the total number of company-managed retail outlets reached 21,017, of which 20,873 were in Mainland China, 144 in Hong Kong and Macau.
We are fully aware of the enormous challenges and difficulties in the business environment in the foreseeable future, especially for the footwear business. But history tells us that a threatening market condition in many cases also breeds potential opportunities. The predicaments we are currently faced with are mostly due to overall weakness in the environment as well as rapid changes in consumer behavior, not a result of being outpaced by competition. As a practical and progressive company with leading brands and channel capabilities, as well as strong industry resources and cash flows, we have the ability and confidence to lead innovation in the industry. With focus and determination we will continue to explore growth opportunities in this new environment.
