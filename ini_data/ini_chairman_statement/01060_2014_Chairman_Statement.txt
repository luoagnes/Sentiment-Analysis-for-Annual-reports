A number of investment projects will be confirmed and rolled out progressively. Coupled with our innovation and commitment in film investment and diverse production, the Group is steadily entering into a golden era in the fast-growing film industry.
Television drama series production and distribution Being one of the favorite entertainments of the Chinese audience, the potential for development of the television drama market is huge. In addition to traditional television broadcasting media, the emergence of online television and online video also becomes a new growth driver of the television drama market.
According to Guosen Securities research report (RLmi|RxvzKNN) in 2013, the transaction value of the entire television drama market is estimated to reach RMB16.5 billion by 2015.
During the year, the Group was dedicated to the production of high-quality films and television drama series and obtained encouraging results and market feedback. The Heroic series is one of the few television drama series that enjoyed both good viewership and public praise in recent years. The series highlighted the mainstream social value, emphasizing on patriotism and heroic deeds, and it successfully created the Heroic spy television series. The series fifth story Righteous Invincible (!que) was launched in the first half of 2013 and achieved satisfactory results.

The Group will continue to enhance the content quality with its excellent creative team, produce and distribute diverse and mainstream-market-driven dramas.

The Group optimized its internal resource allocation and restructured the television advertising and mobile new media businesses, to concentrate its resources on the high value-added businesses, namely film and television drama series production and distribution business as well as online entertainment and media platform. Following the Supplementary Provisions to the Administrative Measures for the Broadcasting of Radio and Television Advertisements ( 0dJTdQ{tl 0vEQ[), which took effect in 2012, the State Administration of Radio Film and Television further issued the Notice on Further Strengthening the Management of Television Channels Broadcasting Television Shopping Advertisement Videos (e2N ekR:_[;SdQirwGrJT{t]Ovw) on 30th October, 2013.

The Group will remain its business relationships with Gansu TV and other television stations (e.g. Shenzhen Satellite Television Network) to provide television advertising sales services. Besides, the mobile new media business (including mobile value-added services, like SMS, digital reading and online games, and mobile television business) recorded stable revenue growth during the year, driven by the rising popularity of the mobile internet and the fast-growing mobile phone users. However, in order to maximize the use and economic return of its resources for the development of high-valued online entertainment and media related businesses, the Group disposed of the mobile television business to an independent third party at the end of 2013 at a satisfactory price of US$18.8 million.
In view of the rising domestic paper costs and wages that caused great pressure on the newspaper advertising and distribution business, the Group announced on 20th June, 2013 the disposal of the 70% equity interest of Beijing Beida Cultural Development Company Limited ( Beida Culture ), a wholly-owned subsidiary, to a third party for a consideration of HK$400 million. Beida Culture owns 50% equity interest of the newspaper advertising and distribution business of Jinghua Culture Broadcast Company Limited ( Jinghua Culture ). By keeping the remaining 15% effective interest in Jinghua Culture, the Group will continue to explore new marketing channels to broaden revenue sources, such as the Cloud Newspaper and Jinghua logistics business.
Through this disposal, the Group will re-allocate resources to focus on the development of businesses with

This huge group of Internet users creates enormous demand for quality films and television drama series. To seize this opportunity, the Group will expand into the online entertainment and media related business together with its strategic partner in 2014.
Therefore, on 8th March, 2014, the Group and Alibaba entered into a conditional share subscription agreement.
