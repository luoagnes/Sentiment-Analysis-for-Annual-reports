CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Our profit attributable to equity holders for 2016 increased
by 126.2% over 2015 to RMB5.11 billion, mainly attributable
to the large increase in sales revenue as a result of the
significant increase in sales volume and the improvement in
product mix during the year.
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
China’s passenger vehicle market recorded a robust growth
in 2016, characterized by the continued strong growth in the
demand for Sport Utility Vehicles (“SUVs”). This is despite
that sedans still being the biggest segment in the market,
the sales volume of sedans in China’s market in 2016 only
recorded a moderate growth. The sales volume of passenger
vehicles from indigenous brands grew faster at 20.5% yearon-year
(“YoY”) in 2016, mainly driven by the growth in
the sales volume of indigenous brand SUVs, compared
with 14.9% YoY growth of the overall China’s passenger
vehicle market according to China Association of Automobile
Manufacturers (“CAAM”).
We further consolidated our leading position in China’s
indigenous brand sedan segment in 2016 as a result of the
good sales performance for our existing and new A-segment
sedan models. The launch of two highly successful new midsize
SUV models “Geely Boyue” (吉利博越) and “Vision SUV”
during the year, significantly increased our market share in
China’s SUV market. As a result, we achieved a respectful
53.6% growth in domestic sales volume in 2016. Such
strong sales volume growth in 2016 was also supported by
our enhanced sales and marketing system in China. As a
result of our strategy of taking a more conservative approach
to contain financial risks in the export markets, our group’s
export sales volume posted a 15.4% YoY decline in 2016.
Our group sold a total of 765,970 units of vehicles in 2016,
up 50.2% from 2015, of which 744,191 units were sold
domestically, up 53.6% from 2015. The remaining 21,779
units or 2.8% of total sales volume were sold abroad, down
15.4% from 2015. Our five most popular models in 2016
included “New Emgrand”, “Vision” (and its successor – “New
Vision”), “Geely Boyue” (吉利博越), “Geely Kingkong” and
“Emgrand GS”, which together accounted for 79.9% of our
group’s total sales volume in 2016.
FINANCIAL REVIEW
Our group’s financial performance in 2016 surpassed the
management’s expectations with total revenue increased by
78.3% to RMB53.72 billion for the year ended 31 December
2016 as strong domestic sales volume growth more than
offset the weaker exports. The mid-size A-segment sedan
model “New Emgrand” remained our group’s most popular
model in terms of sales volume, accounting for 30.1%
of our total sales volume in 2016. During the year, our
group’s average ex-factory selling price (“ASP”) continued to
improve, mainly driven by the improvement in product mix (i.e. 
higher proportion of higher-priced models). Total net profit
of our group grew 125.9% from RMB2.29 billion in 2015 to
RMB5.17 billion in 2016 due to the increase in overall sales
volume, higher ASP and stable profit margin during the year.
After accounting for non-controlling interests, our net profit
attributable to shareholders was up 126.2% from RMB2.26
billion in 2015 to RMB5.11 billion in 2016. Diluted earnings
per share was up 123.4% to RMB57.33 cents. During the
year, our manufacturing operations continued to generate
good operational cash inflow with our group’s total cash
level (bank balances and cash + pledged bank deposits)
increasing 63.8% to RMB15.08 billion at the end of 2016.
DIVIDEND
In view of the strong operational cash inflow in 2016 and
the current high cash level, our board of directors decided
to increase our dividend payout ratio and recommends the
payment of a final dividend of HK$12 cents (2015: HK$3.8
cents) per share for 2016.
PROSPECTS
Under the guidance of the “Made in China 2025” plan (《中
國製造2025》) disseminated by the State Council of the
People’s Republic of China, we will continue to reinforce our
mission of ‘Creating Fine Cars for Everybody’ (造每個人的精
品車) under the “Geely” brand by investing more resources
in research and development and technological innovation.
2016 was a prominent year in our evolution into the New
Geely Era (新吉利時代) as an innovative, well-respected
brand. I have no doubt that the successful implementation
of these initiatives will lead our group to become a much
stronger automobile group.
The technological cooperation between our group and
Volvo Car Corporation, which is majority-owned by our
group’s parent, Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Company
Limited (浙江吉利控股集團有限公司) (“Geely Holding”),
has achieved remarkable progress in the development of
Compact Modular Architecture (“CMA”) platform during
the year, which could enable our group to further optimize
resources utilization, and speed up the implementation of
platform strategy, standardization, shared modularization,
digitalization, electrification and connectivity in product
development so as to better cater our customers’ increasing
demand and equip ourselves with strong and unique
advantages over our competitors. I am confident that the
huge benefits of synergy, technologies enhancement, 
product quality and brand image from the cooperation
would become increasingly obvious in the coming years,
thus boding well for our group’s competitive strength in the
areas of technology, quality and brand. Further, our group
plans to launch the first batch of new models built from
CMA platform, which is jointly developed by Geely Holding
and Volvo Car Corporation, under a new “Lynk&Co” brand
in 2017. The CMA platform, the new “Lynk&Co” brand, and
its new business model are key parts of our group’s strategy
to expand our group’s sales beyond the China market,
to improve our group’s competitiveness against major
international brands and thus to sustain longer-term growth.
I firmly believe that our group is on the right track to achieve
the goal of becoming a leading global automobile group,
targeting to reach the total sales volume of 2 million units
by year 2020 with good reputation and integrity, winning
respects from our customers. Finally, I would like to pay
tribute to all our staff for their hard work and achievements
during 2016 and to our shareholders for their continued
support.
