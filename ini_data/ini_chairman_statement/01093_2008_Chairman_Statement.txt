Chairman s Statement 
I am pleased to report that the Group achieved marked improvement in results for the year ended December 31, 2007. For the fiscal year of 2007, the Group s turnover increased by 41% to HK$4,986 million. Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company increased by over 29 times to HK$477 million.
The Board of Directors recommends the payment of a final dividend of HK5 cents per share for the year ended December 31, 2007.
BUSINESS REVIEW AND OUTLOOK Vitamin C series Total sales volume of the major products of this series increased by 13% to 28,288 tonnes for the current year.
With the market supply and demand moving towards a more balanced state, product prices rebounded significantly during the year. The average price of vitamin C for the year was US$4.60 per kg, an increase of 64.3% over US$2.80 of the previous year. The gross profit margin of the entire series increased from 13.5% in the previous year to 38.0% in the current year.
The current market demand for vitamin C remains strong and product prices continue to stay at a satisfactory level.
It is expected that the performance of this business will be able to improve further in 2008.

Total sales volume of the major products of this series decreased by 5% to 8,102 tonnes for the current year. During the year, market supply has been affected by the more stringent environmental regulations, resulting in a sharp increase of the product prices. The respective average prices of penicillin industrial salt, amoxicillin and 6-APA for the year were US$17.86, US$35.11 and US$38.51 per kg, substantially higher than the respective average prices of US$10.01, US$22.20 and US$20.92 of the previous year. The gross profit margin of the entire series increased from 15.7% in the previous year to 37.5% in the current year.
Market supply has gradually returned to normal with the improvement in the area of environmental protection.
Coupled with the addition of new production capacity in the market, product prices began to decline swiftly in the fourth quarter. Currently, the inventory pressure of the manufacturers has been lessened and product prices have begun to recover from the low level at the beginning of the year. However, the performance of this business in 2008 is not expected to be able to achieve the same profitability level of 2007.

Total sales volume of the major products of this series decreased by 4% to 1,061 tonnes for the current year. After the significant drop in previous year, product prices steadily recovered during the year. The average price of 7-ACA for the year was US$91.31 per kg, an increase of 21.3% over US$75.25 of the previous year. Gross profit margin of the entire series increased from 13.5% in the previous year to 16.2% in the current year.
Product prices have declined recently. It is expected that the performance of this business will be relatively stable in 
Even though market competition was still fierce in the current year, revenue of this business managed to grow by 16.6%. Gross profit margin increased from 22.1% in the previous year to 25.0% in the current year. Sales revenue of the vitamin C supplement products reached HK$64,000,000 for the year, a growth of 74% as compared with the previous year s figure. However, with the substantial increase of selling and distribution expenses, this business only ended up recording an operating profit of HK$6,409,000 for the year, a decline of 79% as compared with the previous year s figure.
Market competition is expected to remain fierce. The Group will try to enhance the performance in 2008 by the introduction of new products and strengthening of sales efforts.

The patent drug, butylphthalide, maintained a steady growth in sales during the year. Apart from strengthening the domestic sales efforts, the Group will continue its efforts to tap into the overseas market.

Liquidity and financial position In 2007, the Group s operating activities generated a net cash inflow of HK$899,494,000. Capital expenditure in relation to the additions of fixed assets amounted to HK$491,740,000. As at December 31, 2007, the Group s current ratio was 1.0, same as the level of the previous year. Debtor turnover period (ratio of the total of trade receivables and bills receivables balance to sales, inclusive of value added tax for sales in the PRC) was 62 days in the current year, as compared with 55 days a year earlier. Owing to the slowdown in sales of penicillin products in the second half of the year, inventory turnover period (ratio of inventories balance to cost of goods sold) increased from 85 days in the previous year to 98 days in the current year.
As at December 31, 2007, the Group had total borrowings of HK$1,701,830,000 (comprising bank loans of HK$1,692,426,000 and loans from an intermediate holding company of HK$9,404,000). The maturity profile spreads over a period of four years with HK$985,447,000 repayable within one year and the remaining HK$716,383,000 repayable between two to four years. Net gearing ratio as at December 31, 2007 was 38% (which was calculated on the basis of the Group s total borrowings net of bank balances and cash of HK$436,843,000 over shareholders equity at the balance sheet date), as compared with 46% a year earlier.
38% of the Group s borrowings are denominated in Hong Kong dollars and the remaining 62% in Renminbi. The Group s revenues are denominated mainly either in Renminbi or in US dollars. Foreign exchange forward contracts are employed by the Group to minimise the currency exposure.
Pledge of assets As at December 31, 2007, bank deposits of HK$751,000 (2006: HK$4,104,000) were pledged to banks to secure banking facilities granted to the Group.

As disclosed in the Company s press announcement dated February 22, 2005, the Company and one of its subsidiaries are named as, among others, defendants in a number of antitrust complaints filed in the United States.
Up to the date of this report, four antitrust complaints have been served on the Company and three antitrust complaints have been served on the subsidiary.
The directors and management of the Company intend to contest the claims set out in the antitrust complaints vigorously. The Group has appointed legal advisors to advise them in the legal proceedings and the outcome of the antitrust complaints cannot be reliably estimated with reasonable certainty at this stage.
Further information on the antitrust complaints is set out in note 40 to the consolidated financial statements.

As at December 31, 2007, the Group had about 9,370 employees, the majority of them were employed in the PRC.
The Group will continue to offer competitive remuneration packages, discretionary share options and bonuses to staff based on the performance of the Group and the individual employee.

On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to take this opportunity to express our sincere thanks to our shareholders for their support and to our staff for their commitment and diligence during this year.
By order of the Board
