Further afield, we provide an advanced voice-data-IP network that links our home market with the rest of the world and carries traffic between internationally-dispersed geographies.

During a challenging and competitive year, we achieved steady growth and solid progress into network rollout. We have built an advanced and integrated mobile and fixed-line infrastructure that can meet growing demand for bandwidth and broadband service applications. At the same time, we benefit from a strong financial position and healthy operating cash flow.
We are well positioned to explore and capitalise on opportunities generated by upwardly-spiraling demand for bandwidth and an increasing appetite for mobile data services. This bodes well for the future development of our businesses, as well as reinforcement of our market leadership in an economic environment that has yet to make a full recovery.
Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the Board and all staff members for their dedication, professionalism and determination to succeed.
