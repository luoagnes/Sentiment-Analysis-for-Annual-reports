CHAIRMAN S STATEMENT 
To the Shareholders, 2009 marked a new chapter in the Group s development and saw the Group entering into a new development stage. The Group has changed its name to ChinaVision Media Group Limited eS-N WPdW gPlQS on 14th October, 2009 to reflect the new business focus which is the planning and distribution of television and film production, print media business, online game and mobile wireless new media businesses. I am pleased to share our progress in expanding our business in the television and film media and mobile new media, and the results of the Group in 2009.
The cultural and media industry in the People s Republic of China (the PRC ) is presented with a huge opportunity. In 2009, in order to pursue the upgrade of cultural and media industry, the PRC Government, on the one hand, proposed promoting a cultural industry by accelerating the development of culture and creativity, television and film production, and publication and distribution businesses, while on the other hand, actively proposed developing new media, including digital multimedia broadcast television and mobile television. With the 3G era now in full swing with coverage rapidly expanding, mobile entertainment has become a high growth segment in the mobile and telecom industries. The growth of the entire cultural and media entertainment industry in China has far exceeded that of the world. Backed by the supportive policies and favorable market environment, the Group is aiming to build an integrated cultural enterprise. Towards that end, with an advanced operational model and through standardised management, the Group has completed mergers and acquisitions integrating many influential television and film media and mobile and network game companies. It has also enlisted a few dozens of China s top artists to quickly expedite the development of content for the Mainland China s television and film entertainment and multimedia entertainment industries.
ChinaVision s strategic objective is to become a leading international media group.
TELEVISION AND FILM PRODUCTION In television and film production, the Group has successfully targeted the highly educated and mature audience segment as well as the young audience and satisfied the entertainment needs of a wide spectrum of viewing audiences by producing its own quality drama and distributing the popular Haiyan drama. During the year, the Group focused on the investment, production and distribution of drama in the PRC. The Group boasts an excellent management and investment team supported by abundant filming resources and a worldwide distribution network. It has invested in and distributed a series of outstanding television series and films in 2009, among which !que Nf was the self-produced series of the Group. Following the first series N!que which was well received by the mainland audience in 2008, the second series R!que which debuted in 2009 has also achieved excellent results with the audience rating ranked among the top three series. The Group is currently filming the third series zf!que which features the outstanding actor Chen Baoguo, winner of the )YNs. This much anticipated series is expected to be another annual blockbuster for the Group. The Group has just finished the filming of another major series a(W+'Y0W which is expected to generate another record high audience rating.

TELEVISION AND FILM PRODUCTION (Continued) The Group is also committed to presenting productions with content that appeals to the young audience.
The new drama series under production based on the work of best-selling author and screenwriter Lu Haiyan embody this commitment. The new drama series hs[b2 written by Lu Haiyan will be directed by renowned director Gao Xixi and feature top actress Sun Li and talented actor Zhou Yiwei. This business together with the Group s artist agency operation and brand has created synergies forming a solid competitive foundation for the Group. The Group is aided in its efforts by the support of many excellent artists from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Mainland China. It has already signed contracts with more than 30 Mainland top artists and writers, including Ge You and Chen Baoguo in addition to Lu Haiyan, to enhance its strength in the television and film distribution business.
In addition, the Group also operates a TV programme promotion package business. The scope of this business covers creativity planning, video advertising production, 3D road safety display, and traditional and online TV programme promotion package design, and related equipment sales. The aim is to provide a one-stop scalable service that can extend across the range of customers requirements.
The Group has made major investment in two films namely Let the Bullets Fly and Lan during the year.
Let The Bullets Fly is headlined by leading Chinese superstars Jiang Wen, Chow Yun-Fat and Ge You supported by seven other leading actors including Hu Jun, Chen Kun, Liao Fan and Shao Bing. The star- studded cast plus the participation of the famous director Feng Xiaogang has created the promotional concept of the Constellation of 11 Superstars. Filming has finished and the global release has been scheduled before the end of year 2010. On the other hand, Lan , the first film directed by Jiang Wenli, has been released in the PRC during April this year. This film has won a KNN Movie Award (Audience Award) , a newly established category in the Pusan International Film Festival 2009, and Best Actor and Best Director awards in the First Macau International Movie Festival.
PRINT MEDIA BUSINESS The Group s acquisition of the entire issued share capital of Prefect Strategy International Limited and Main City Limited Group was approved by its shareholders on 15th March, 2010 and 16th April, 2010, respectively.
Upon completion of the two transactions, the Group will have indirect control and 100% effective interests in Beijing Beida Culture Development Company LimitedSNS'YeS|vU gPlQS that owns 50% equity interests in JingHua Culture Broadcast Company LimitedNeSPd gPlQS ( JingHua Culture ).
With the Operating Licence for Publications and approved business certificate, JingHua Culture is principally engaged in operating the advertising agency business and newspaper distribution business for Beijing Times together with other businesses as permitted under its business certificate. Beijing Times covers more than a 70% share of the morning post retail market in Beijing and the largest circulation among all morning posts in the capital. The morning post market boasts a quality advertising base and huge distribution volume. Among the city s core readers aged between 25 and 44 who possess the strongest spending power, there are 85% classified as the active readers of Beijing Times , while 86% are categorised as loyalty readers. With the pulling power of the brand, Beijing Times is the leader in the Beijing morning post retail market.

PRINT MEDIA BUSINESS (Continued) Beijing Times solely owns the Chinese newspaper publishing right and also operates the newspaper website N} and a mobile online newspaperNKb_j1X , as well as e-business 0Q[ 0P[FUR and logisticsNirAm businesses. Capitalising on the brand of Beijing Times and the professional logistic and distribution system of N=, Beijing Times has built a one-stop professional e-business shopping platform Q[ E-business Healthy Life Supermarket ( Q[P[FURePu;m ). In addition, the Beijing Times mobile newspaper NKb_j1X delivers essential news information any time and anywhere, breaking the limitation of time and place of traditional print media. The online newspaper N}1X}NR holds six telecommunications and information licences including Operating License for Telecommunication and Information Services. All of these businesses present huge market and growth potential to the Group.
ONLINE GAME AND MOBILE WIRELESS NEW MEDIA 3G mobile games have rapidly gained popularity across the country after the 3G licences were granted in 2009. During the year under review, our new multiplayer online game, Twin Castle Online , won the hearts of many game lovers because many players can play simultaneously at any moment via either Internet or 3G mobile phones, and thus never go offline . In 2010, the Group plans to launch new projects, including DOBO gaming platform 3.0 and a massive multiplayer online role-playing game sT and a virtual operation game NLut}t , which we believe can enlarge the market share in mobile games and achieve the top spots in mobile game rankings.
In December 2009, the Group established a partnership with Renminwang (www.people.com.cn) under The People s Daily to set up Nl eS gPlQS ( Nl ) for developing mobile TV businesses. The collaboration aims to build the largest mobile video lifestyle and entertainment platform offering extensive information covering social, political, legal and business news, as well as lifestyle and entertainment updates.
Renminwang is one of the only seven operators that have been licensed for mobile TV operation. Following by the latest edition of Nl content to be injected into China Mobile TV base, we are constructing substantial revenues from our mobile TV business and expect to achieve an extensive growth. After connecting to the mobile audio and visual content service platform, Nl can boost its business by extending its mobile TV programmes vertically to mobile channel operators. Leveraging on the competitive edges from the Chinese-oriented content as well as the exclusive license right, adding with the quality professional team, we expect to boost its growth substantially.
For its value-added wireless service, the Group continued to concentrate on mobile entertainment through leveraging its core team s abundant experience in developing games on different platforms to offer new product and services for users on MTK, J2ME and Symbian, etc.

Our management team is recognised in the entertainment and media industry throughout China. It comprises professionals from mainstream satellite TV stations, major news agencies and mobile TV operators in China, and thus delivers an extensive network of business associates in the cultural, media and entertainment sectors.
In 2009, through mergers, acquisitions and integration and realignment of internal resources, the Group consolidated into three major businesses, hence laying a solid foundation for future business development.
The businesses are namely (1) television and film production, (2) print media, and (3) online game and mobile wireless new media. After the introduction of the policy directive The financial support of cultural industries and revitalising the guidance of development and prosperity, the PRC Government has established seven objectives to thrive the movie industry enhancing the cross-border development. With the 3G-mobilily era, it is expected that more than 700 million mobile phone users in the PRC market will gradually shift from 2G to 3G.
Meanwhile, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting s 20092013 Global Entertainment and Media Industry Outlook report, Chinese domestic entertainment and media industry will enjoy a rapid growth of a CAGR of 9.5%, reaching USD110 billion in 2013. This is far beyond the global average CAGR of 2.7%.
We believe the prospect of new media is rosy and the sales opportunities arising from mobile TV and mobile game industries will be enormous. The Group is ready to strike into the new media division to gain market shares, and predicts the new mobile media business would greatly enhance our core competence. Looking to the future, traditional television and film production and print media businesses will continue to generate strong cash inflows. Online games and wireless mobile new media will have strong development potentials to lead a path of long-term high growth to the Group.
In 2010, we target to enhance our business development by leveraging our competitive strengths. While the government actively supports the development of culture, film, mobile and internet industries, we will continue to explore more opportunities by acquiring outstanding companies in the industry in order to enhance the Group s diverse expansion within the cultural and new media industries. In addition we will enhance the film production and distribution business, as well as the new media business by consolidating the internal resources, so as to create synergies between the businesses, resources and management teams.
Meanwhile, the Group will perfect its operating system and mechanism, so as to build it as a Chinese cultural media conglomerate achieving the international standard with outstanding core competitive edges.
Last but not least, I would like to thank the support of all shareholders, and the hard work of our management team and staff of our subsidiaries on the business consolidation activities in the previous year. By adhering to the motto of Leading future development through cultural creativity uReeS _*gO , we will strive our utmost to generate long-term returns for our shareholders.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Review of Operations During the year ended 31st December, 2009, the Group was primarily engaged in the distribution and manufacture of cement and clinker business prior to the disposal of the manufacture function in September 2009. Since the second half of the year, the Group has diversified its businesses into the planning, production, publication, investment and distribution of television drama and film and organizing cultural and artistic exchange business in the PRC, network and mobile game business in the PRC, and securities trading and 
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (Continued) Change of Company Name To reflect the Group s diversification into the media and media-related businesses in the PRC, the Group changed its company name from Shanghai Allied Cement Limited to ChinaVision Media Group Limited and the adoption of the new Chinese name eS-N WPdW gPlQS . Such resolutions were passed at the Special General Meeting of the Company held on 9th September, 2009 and became effective on 14th October, 
Cement and Clinker Business For the year ended 31st December, 2009, the Group s sales volume of cement and clinker amounted to 1,788,000 tons (2008: 2,164,000 tons), representing a decrease of 17.4% as compared to that of 2008, and the turnover was HK$343,070,000 (2008: HK$552,847,000), representing a decrease of 37.9% as compared to that of 2008. The segment profit was HK$12,364,000 (2008: HK$49,637,000), representing a decrease of 75.1% as compared to that for the last year.
The decline in sales volume and turnover, and segment profit was resulted from the Group s disposal of the manufacturing business of cement and clinker in September 2009.
On 21st May, 2009, the Group announced to sell the entire issued share capital of a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group, Shanghai Allied Cement Holdings Limited ( SACHL ), which together with its subsidiaries engaging in the manufacturing business of cement and clinker, at a total consideration of HK$200,000,000.
Upon completion of the disposal on 16th September, 2009, the Group made a loss of HK$202,425,000.
Despite the cement and clinker business being profit making, the Group considered that the return was not commensurate with the Group s carrying cost in the investment of SACHL and its subsidiaries which, in turn, locked up substantial amount of resources in the fixed assets and working capital. In view of that, management believed it is best not to inject further cash into the manufacturing side of the cement business, to release locked-up resources and to use part of the proceeds to reduce high gearing level. Since then, the Group has fully focused on its media-related businesses and multi-media industry.
