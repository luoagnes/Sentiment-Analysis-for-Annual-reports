On 19 January 2012, the Company announced the disposal of the Coating Business at a consideration of HK$154,000,000 for the reasons below: (i) the escalating awareness for a more stringent environmental protection and product safety laws and regulations pertaining to the Group s manufacturing facilities and products in the PRC; (ii) the public perception of the pollutive nature of the paint and coating manufacturing industry; (iii) the increase in price of crude oil, other key raw materials and labour costs, growing market competition of paint and petrochemical products worldwide; (iv) the increase in the capital expenditure for replacement of aging production facilities; (v) the escalating labour and production costs as a result of the difficulty in hiring staff for the environmentally sensitive paint manufacturing business; (vi) the increase in cost in order to ensure the Coating Business complies with relevant laws and regulations, in particular those regarding hazardous substances and environmental safety; and (vii) the substantial capital outlay and maintenance costs for the relocation of the existing manufacturing and storage facilities from Shenzhen to a more remote location at Zhong Xin Town, 
Subsequent to the completion of the disposal of the Coating Business on 2 April 2012, the Lighting Business has become the core business segment of the Group.
During the year, the business and financial performances of the Lighting Business have been adversely affected by the unfavourable global market conditions, the business growth of the Lighting Business as well as the pricing of the LED products were lower than expected and to increase the competitiveness of the LED products of the Group, the Group has allocated additional resources on research and development of new LED related products and technologies such that the Group can lower the production costs and to differentiate itself from its competitors in the LED market. As a result of the keen market competition, the sales volume and the gross profit margin of the LED products were persistently decreasing for the year ended 31 December 2012. The revenue of the Lighting Business was about HK$156,265,000 for the year ended 31 December 2012 while it was approximately HK$153,085,000 for year ended 31 December 2011; the acquisition of the Lighting Business was completed on 17 March 2011. The loss for the year was mainly due to impairment of inventory, impairment of goodwill and the rise in administrative expenses, including the research and development expenses, impairment of trade and other receivables.
As at 31 December 2012, an accumulated impairment loss on trade receivables amounting HK$27,728,000 was mainly made for overdue receivables with aging period over one and a half year as to comply with the applicable accounting standard in accordance with the long outstanding loan and receivables. The Company had sought the advices from its PRC legal adviser and the PRC legal adviser suggested to issue relevant legal letter(s) to the debtor requesting the payment of the overdue balances. In the event that the debtor fail to repay the overdue balances in the near future, the Company will discuss with the PRC legal adviser to take further necessary actions. Details please refer to note 21 to the consolidated financial statements.
As a result of the unsatisfactory business and financial performance of the Group and the deteriorating industry prospect as abovementioned, an impairment loss of HK$128,257,000 on the goodwill arising from the acquisition of Lighting Business has been made during the year ended 31 December 2012. Details please refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.

During the year of 2012, given that the technology of LED has become more common nowadays, the technology barrier has been lowered and more new competitors have entered into the LED market in the PRC, causing persistent decrease in the level of prices of LED related products. As a result of the keen market competition, the sales volume and the gross profit margin of the LED products were persistently decreasing for the year ended 31 December 2012. In view of the above, the Directors are not optimistic on the business prospect of the LED business in the near future.
Accordingly, the Directors strived to improve the business operations and financial position of the Group by proactively seeking potential investment opportunities that could diversify its existing business portfolio and broaden its source of income, and enhance value to the shareholders of the Company.
Since 2011, the property market in the PRC have experienced a minor correction with surge in property prices being slowed down and decrease in transaction volume due to the austerity measures, including restriction on home purchase, imposed by the PRC government. Such correction resulted in a slowdown in the property market in the short term, but it helped curbing speculative activities which should be beneficial to the market in the long run. According to China and Major Cities Real Estate Market Report in 2012 # (2012 -N W ;N W ?b 0W "u 4X N f 1X) published by China Index Academy, there are recent signs of bottoming out as the total sales of property in 1st-tier cities and 2nd-tier cities during the year 2012 have increased by 24.04% and 39.32%, respectively, comparing to 2011 after the People s Bank of China announced the interest rate cut. The Directors believe that such monetary loosening policy is likely to continue and expect that the PRC property market will begin to 
Strong economic growth has been observed in Yueyang, being a 3rd- tier city in the PRC, mainly due to the development of infrastructure and completion of railway and expressway projects. In line with the economic growth, the disposable income per capita and urbanization rate in Yueyang have also recorded persistent increase over the past decade. Therefore, it is expected that the favorable outcome of these figures will drive the domestic demand for luxurious residential districts in Yueyang as disposable income and urbanization rates are both key drivers of the property market.
In view of the economic prospect and the potential in the property market of Yueyang, the Directors consider that the acquisition of Yueyang property project represents a good investment opportunity for the Company and would generate stable source of recurring diversified income to the Group.
