Chairman s Statement 
I report the activities of the Company and its subsidiaries (together the Group ) for the year ended 31 December 
Business Review and Strategy For the year ended 31 December 2006, the Group recorded a turnover of HK$83.4 million, comprising HK$66.5 million from Hong Kong operations and HK$16.9 million from The People s Republic of China ( PRC ) operations, representing a decrease of 12%, when compared to 2005. Loss for the year attributable to the equity holders of the Company was HK$14.2 million (2005: profit of HK$3.4 million), which consisted of profit from Hong Kong operations of HK$0.9 million and a loss of HK$15.1 million from the PRC operations. The loss was largely attributable to the increase in marketing and printing costs resulting from circulation boost strategies, disposal of a PRC subsidiary in mid 2006, and the initial investment costs of e JESSICA PRC version.

The Group s operations in Hong Kong are expected to bounce back with stringent cost control measures as well as stronger sales and marketing teams. Individual titles will continue brand strengthening activities, and see further growth in advertising and circulation revenues.
The Group s PRC portfolio has recovered from the temporary adjustment of the disposal of a PRC subsidiary, and is expected to benefit from the booming PRC economic environment. Titles in the initial investment stage are expected to move into the strong growth stage.
Overall, the Group s aim is to achieve satisfactory returns to shareholders.

On behalf of the Board, I wish to express my gratitude to our readers, clients and shareholders for their continued support and all our staff members for their hard work and dedicated services.
