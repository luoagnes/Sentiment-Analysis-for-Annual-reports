For the year ended 31st December 2008, although the Group s consolidated turnover increased by 5.88% to HK$335,697,000 (2007: HK$317,066,000), the net profit attributable to shareholders of the Company decreased to HK$4,376,000 in comparison with that of HK$24,535,000 in 2007.

The Board do not recommend the payment of a dividend for the year ended 31st December, 2008 (2007: final dividend of HK3 cents per share and a special dividend of HK3 cents per share).
Management Discussion and Analysis Review of Operations During the year under review, despite the fierce competition in the paints market, the Group achieved a moderate increase of 5.88% to HK$335,697,000 (2007: HK$317,006,000) in turnover. The increase in turnover was mainly due to the Group s constant efforts to upgrade products and services, develop new markets, deepen its contacts and consolidate closer ties with its customers.
The Group endeavoured to tighten stringent cost control, search for less expensive raw material, expand sources of supply, rationalize and streamline the work and production process in order to improve operational efficiency and enhance the Group s competitiveness. However, with the escalation in price of crude oil, price of other key raw material, labour cost and administrative expenses prior to the financial crisis beginning in September 2008, the net profit for the year decreased by 35.83% to HK$14,904,000 (2007: HK$23,226,000), together with the dilution effect as a result of the disposal of 49% equity interests in Rookwood Investments Limited in the fourth quarter of 2007, the profit attributable to shareholders of the Company dropped by 82.16% to HK$4,376,000 (2007: 
In November 2007, the Group entered into a conditional sale and purchase agreement (the Conditional Agreement ) with independent third parties, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, to acquire two coal mines in Inner Mongolia. As a result of the financial crisis and decline in the economies of the world, the demand for natural resources including coal has become uncertain. After careful consideration and deliberation with the vendors, it was agreed and decided that it might not be in the interests of the parties concerned to proceed with the Conditional Agreement under the prevalent economic circumstances and the vendors and the Group mutually agreed to terminate the Conditional Agreement in November 2008. Hence, a deed of termination to terminate the Conditional Agreement was executed to consolidate and restructure the debts in the form of the indebtedness for a term of two years from the date of the deed of termination in order to safeguard the repayment to and recovery by the Group of the indebtedness. Interest income will be received quarterly by the Group during the term of the indebtedness.

The global financial tsunami hit the global economy badly and damaged business confidence throughout the world.
Looking ahead, the growth of the business will depend on the ability of the global economy to recover from the financial crisis and the year 2009 will be very challenging for the industry of paints and petrochemical and related products. Despite the adverse market conditions, the Group aims to reinforce its competitiveness, consolidate its relationship with customers, expand its customer base, increase the sale of its high-yield products and enhance product quality in order to maintain continual growth when the global economy revives from the financial crisis.
In light of the global financial crisis, the Group will take a more cautious view in its investment activities. Equipped with a strong and healthy financial position, the Group is well-placed to continue to identify grossly under-valued investment opportunities in order to diversify the business of the Group and maximize returns for its shareholders.
Subsequent to the year end, the Company repurchased 27,140,000 ordinary shares of the Company on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited in the range from HK$0.84 to HK$0.85 for a total consideration of approximately HK$23,000,000. At the balance sheet date, the net asset value per share attributable to shareholders of the Company was HK$1.30, therefore, such repurchase would lead to an enhancement of the net asset value per share and earnings per share of the Company where the directors consider it to be in the best interests of the Company.
Financial Resources, Borrowings and Capital Structure As at 31st December 2008, the Group s non-current assets amounted to HK$329,097,000 (2007: HK$253,435,000) and net current assets amounted to HK$207,198,000 (2007: HK$280,306,000) with a current ratio of 8.0 (2007: 6.0) calculated on the basis of the Group s current assets over current liabilities.
During the year ended 31st December 2008, the Group had no borrowings outstanding. The Group has sufficient cash surplus to finance operation from internally generated cash flow. The Group maintained a satisfactory financial position derived from the steady growth of its business. As at 31st December 2008, the Group had cash on hand of HK$106,945,000 (2007: HK$173,948,000).
Exposure to Foreign Exchange Risk Business transactions of the Group are mainly denominated in Hong Kong dollars and Renminbi. Currently, the Group does not engage in any hedging contract. In view of the fluctuation of Renminbi during the year, the Group will monitor the situation closely and will introduce suitable measures if there are likely to be any changes.
Employee and Remuneration Policies As at 31st December 2008, the Group had around 1,100 full-time employees. They included management and administrative staff and production workers. Most of them were stationed in Mainland China while the rest were in Hong Kong.
