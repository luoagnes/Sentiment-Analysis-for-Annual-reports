CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
OVERVIEW
While 2016 was a challenging year full of financial and
political uncertainties, the Group has performed well
and delivered satisfactory results on multiple fronts. On
expansions, apart from the closing of the acquisition
of a hotel site in Tokyo, the Group has successfully
acquired a site in downtown Seattle, U.S. for US$18
million in December 2016. The site is located in the
heart of Seattle’s city centre and close to the famous
historic Pike Place market. The site has an area of
approximately 19,400 sq. ft. and has already been
approved for the development of a 17-storey hotel.
However, we shall explore other available options to
further enhance the development of this site. These
acquisitions are supported by their undemanding
valuations and were part of the Group’s long term
strategy to expand in strategic gateway cities that will
anchor our hotel brand as well as residential and office
development.
On divestments, as the asset manager of the U.S. Fund
(“Fund”), we took advantage of a strong office market
in San Francisco, and have disposed of the Fund’s
three office buildings in and around San Francisco
in 2016. This has resulted in a distribution income
from the Fund of HK$280.6 million attributable to
our interest in the Fund for the year. In addition,
the Group booked a disposal gain in relation to the
deferred profit made when we transfer the office
buildings to the Fund in 2014. These one-off gains
were the drivers that boosted the Group’s core profit
in 2016. Other than acting on behalf of the Fund,
the Group has also disposed of its remaining office
building in the U.S., namely 2700 Ygnacio located on
the far outskirts of San Francisco, for US$15 million
in late 2016. Therefore, the realised gain on disposal
of U.S. properties amounted to HK$398.2 million in
2016 comprised of the deferred gain on the transfer
of our office buildings to the Fund, as well as a loss
generated from the sale of 2700 Ygnacio.
As for the Group’s results in 2016, the core operating
income increased by 29.8% to HK$2,943.9 million
in 2016 (2015: HK$2,268.0 million) as the U.S. Fund
declared its first distribution and as improvements
were seen across the Group’s businesses. Distribution
income from Champion REIT rose by 22% to
HK$871.6 million in 2016, mainly attributable to
the higher occupancy at Three Garden Road and, to
a lesser extent, our increased holdings in the REIT.
EBITDA of the Hotels Division increased by 21.4%
to HK$720.6 million, which was driven primarily
by the improved revenue and margin expansion of
the North American Hotels despite currency drop in
Australia, New Zealand, Canada, United Kingdom
and China where we own hotels. Besides, distribution
from LHI recorded a growth of 9.1% and amounted
to HK$300.8 million in 2016, as a result of both
improved performance of the Hong Kong hotels and
we had our increased holdings in LHI.
Administration expenses increased by 10.5% to
HK$372.6 million in 2016 (2015: HK$337.2 million),
mostly attributable to the increased headcount mainly
for the Project Management and Development team
as the Group carried out more development projects.
Other income included a gain amounting to
HK$7.5 million resulted from the selling of all of the
hedging contracts against the Japanese Yen. These
contracts were originally entered into in early 2016 to
hedge our cash payment for the Tokyo hotel project
later that year. The hedge was unnecessary after we
have successfully secured a loan with a low interest
rate for the payments. Subsequently, we managed
to sell the contracts for a profit after the Yen had
depreciated towards the end of the year. However,
other income of the Group still dropped by 76.4% to
HK$62.3 million in 2016, since such income in 2015
included a disposal gain of an associate company and
a large gain was booked from the sale of securities.
In 2016, the Group has written off a non-core
investment in a startup company in the U.S. This
investment was relatively small to the Group’s overall
asset base and we believed that this co-work club
company, involving the sharing economy, should
benefit from the exponentially accelerating demand in
the future. However, given the remarkably high startup
cost and as its liquidity position has deteriorated
rapidly throughout 2016, we were of the view that this
startup would fail as its cash shortfall widens, whereas
rising interest rates will likely deter its access to new
capital to fund the enlarging shortfall. Such write
off was reflected as impairment on loan receivables
amounting to HK$199.1 million in 2016’s results.
Since our write off at year end 2016, the company
has developed a rejuvenation plan which may provide
the company with renewed business edge. As the
company is offering attractive investment terms on
new fund raised, we have decided to participate in the
new offering with a small US$5 million (approximately
HK$38.8 million) investment, and should have
convertible rights to become the biggest shareholder
of the company.
Interest income of the Group fell by 71.8% to
HK$42.1 million in 2016, given the Group’s cash were
mostly denominated in Hong Kong dollars in 2016,
while a large portion of the Group’s cash in 2015
were denominated in Renminbi that bore much higher
deposit rates. Interest expense dropped by 23.3% to
HK$134.0 million in 2016 (2015: HK$174.8 million)
as a result of both repayment of certain high interest
bearing loans, and refinancing some loans with lower
interest rates.
Share of results of joint ventures in 2016 comprised
of returns from our 50% interest in the Dalian project
and our investment in a residential development
project in Miami, U.S.. For the Dalian project, while
there was a development profit from the recognition
of 220 apartments in 2016, such profit turned to a
loss after providing for a disproportionate share of
the estimated land appreciation tax, and therefore,
this has resulted in a after-tax loss of HK$7.5 million
for our interest in the project for the year. There was
also a loss booked for the Miami project in 2016. As
the Miami project was still at the pre-sales stage, the
loss was predominately attributable to the marketing
and administrative expenses incurred. In total, losses
amounted to HK$20.2 million for our share of results
of joint ventures in 2016.
Although core profit was adversely affected by nonoperating
items including lower other income, interest
income and a one-off write-off, the declines were
much more than offset by the booking of a disposal
gain from the sale of the U.S. offices attributable to
the Group. After taking into account an approximately
40% tax on such disposal gain, profit after tax for the
Group rose by 13.8% to HK$2,031.9 million in 2016
(2015: HK$1,785.7 million), and profit attributable to
equity holders rose by 13.6% to HK$2,022.5 million in
2016 (2015: HK$1,780.1 million).
Revenue of the Hotels Division rose by 2.4% to
HK$3,715.0 million in 2016. The increase was primarily
driven by an increase in revenue of the hotels in North
America, followed by the improved revenue of the
hotels in Australia/New Zealand. Given the fixed cost
nature of the hotel business, the EBITDA of the Hotels
Division recorded a much higher growth of 21.4%
and rose to HK$720.6 million in 2016, and the growth
was even higher at 25.4% before accounting for the
translation losses from foreign currencies. It should be
noted that the hotel in downtown Washington, D.C.,
USA is still undergoing renovation and was closed
throughout 2016.
In North America, the growth in EBITDA was led by
improvements in the revenue and EBITDA margin
of the Chelsea hotel in Toronto, The Langham
Huntington, Pasadena and The Langham, Chicago.
Whereas the Rev PAR growth of the Pasadena and
Chicago hotels was driven by increases in room
rates alone, the Rev PAR of the Toronto hotel was
attributable to an increase in both occupancy and
room rate, as its occupancy recovered in 2016 from
a low level during the renovation works in 2015. The
growth in EBITDA of the Toronto hotel was diminished
by the modest 3.4% depreciation in the average
exchange rate of the Canadian dollar against the Hong
Kong dollar in 2016.
Performance of the Boston hotel was steady in 2016
but the Langham Place, Fifth Avenue hotel in New
York suffered a decline in revenue in 2016, which was
attributable to the negative impact of the renovation
works and challenging market conditions in New York.
Total revenue of the hotels in North America increased
by 6.3% in 2016, while the growth in EBITDA was
much higher at 59.8%.
EBITDA of the hotels in Australasia was lifted by the
improved performance of The Langham, Auckland
and The Langham, Sydney. The Langham, Auckland
witnessed an improvement in occupancy and room
rate which contributed to drive EBITDA growth as
margin expands. The EBITDA growth of The Langham,
Sydney was mainly due to its turnaround, as the
hotel incurred a substantial loss in 2015 when it was
carrying out major renovation works.
In 2016, there was a minor decrease in the revenue
and EBITDA of The Langham, London in local currency
terms, which were mainly due to the negative impact
of the renovation works. However, the decline in
revenue and EBITDA of the hotel was exacerbated
by the adverse currency translation, given a 11.3%
depreciation in the average exchange rate of the
British pound in 2016.
In China, revenue growth of The Langham, Xintiandi
in Shanghai would have been even higher in 2016,
but the replacement of business tax by value added
tax in May 2016 has adversely affected the amount
of revenue recognised by the hotel since then.
Nonetheless, the improved underlying business
momentum was reflected in the growth of the hotel’s
EBITDA, which grew at a faster rate in 2016. Note
that as the average exchange rate of the Renminbi
experienced a depreciation of 5.3% in the year, the
growth in revenue was translated to a drop in revenue
in Hong Kong dollar terms, whereas the growth in
EBITDA was also lowered in Hong Kong dollar terms.
Besides, a small portion of the pre-opening expense
amounting to HK$6.9 million related to the Cordis,
Hongqiao, which is expected to open in the first half
of 2017, has been included in the EBITDA of the China
hotels.
EBITDA of the Hotels Division also included hotel
management fee income from pure managed hotels
and any surplus or shortfall incurred by the Group as
the lessee of LHI’s hotels, which are included under the
“others” breakdown of the Hotels Division’s EBITDA.
There was an increase in hotel management fee
income in 2016, as a one-off fee was received from
two pipeline hotels. Furthermore, as the performance
of LHI’s hotels recovered, the shortfall the Group has
incurred as the lessee of LHI has dropped in 2016.
Performances of the Hong Kong hotels below were
extracted from the 2016 results announcement of
LHI relating to the performance of the trust group’s
properties.
HONG KONG HOTELS
After the spinoff of the Hong Kong Hotels, the
financial returns on the Group’s 61.9% equity stake in
the three hotels in Hong Kong were reflected through
our investment in LHI, under the section “Investment
in LHI”.
The Langham, Hong Kong
The Langham, Hong Kong, recorded a 1.5% decline
in Rev PAR in 2016, which was rather moderate as
compared with the 3.6% drop in its respective High
Tariff A hotel market (considered as 5-star rated
hotels). The hotel benefitted from keen demand for
its renovated rooms and was able to capture more
travellers from Mainland China. There was also growth
in arrivals from other geographical regions, which all
contributed to an improved occupancy for the hotel.
This was, however, offset by a decline of average room
rate in 2016.
Revenue from food and beverage (“F&B”) rose by
0.7% year-on-year in 2016, driven mainly by the
stronger business growth at the T’ang Court as a result
of the prestigious Michelin three-star rating awarded 
at the end of 2015. There was also revenue growth
at the Bostonian, which witnessed improved business
after its renovation in July 2016 with revamped menus.
However, F&B revenue from banqueting business
remained weak during 2016.
During 2016, the hotel achieved average occupancy of
87.7% on an average of 498 rooms (2015: 84.7% on
an average of 457 rooms) and an average room rate
of HK$2,092 (2015: HK$2,198).
Cordis, Hong Kong
At Cordis, Hong Kong, a year-on-year Rev PAR decline
of 4.5% was inferior to that of its respective High
Tariff A market. However, it was mostly due to the
temporary negative impact from the protests which
broke out in Mongkok during the Chinese New Year
in early 2016. Rev PAR dropped by 18% year-on-year
during February and March 2016 which dragged down
the Rev PAR for the full year in 2016. Nevertheless,
demand picked up after the protests and growth in
arrivals across most major markets was seen in the
reminder of the year.
Revenue from F&B increased 4.1% year-on-year in
2016 which was mainly attributable to the improved
revenue of The Place, which underwent renovation
during the first quarter of 2015. Alibi also recorded
a pick-up in business in 2016, offsetting an absence
of income from the Tokoro Restaurant which was
converted to back office since the beginning of 2016.
For the year 2016, the hotel achieved average
occupancy of 89.8% on an average of 653 rooms
(2015: 89.7% on an average of 620 rooms) and an
average room rate of HK$1,653 (2015: HK$1,734).
Eaton, Hong Kong
The Eaton, Hong Kong recorded a 3.1% decline in
Rev PAR in 2016, which was more than the 2.0%
decline witnessed in its respective High Tariff B
hotel market (considered as 4-star rated hotel). The
underperformance was due to severe room rate
competition from nearby hotels. However, with flexible
room rates, the hotel witnessed growth in arrivals
from all major geographical regions in 2016 with an
increase of 6.1 percentage points in the occupancy of
the hotel in 2016, which helped to offset the 9.2%
decline in the average room rate.
Revenue from F&B dropped by 8.6% year-on-year in
2016, which was mainly attributable to substantially
lower banqueting revenue. However, it is worth noting
that its Chinese restaurant, Yat Tung Heen, received
the Michelin one-star rating in November 2016,
after which there was a strong pick-up in business in
December 2016.
For the year 2016, the hotel achieved average
occupancy of 95.6% (2015: 89.5%) and an average
room rate of HK$992 (2015: HK$1,093).
OVERSEAS HOTELS
Year-on-year growths for the overseas hotels below
refer to percentage growth in local currencies.
EUROPE
The Langham, London
The renovation of 109 rooms that started in November
2015 and throughout 2016 has negatively impacted
the revenue of the hotel. The renovation was originally
scheduled to be completed in the third quarter of
2016, but was eventually delayed to January 2017.
Although with less room inventory, the hotel witnessed
an increase in both occupancy and average room rate
in 2016. The higher room rate achieved was a result of
the hotel’s successful strategy to accommodate more
high yielding retail and corporate travellers. Revenue
from F&B also rose in the year, which was attributable
to an improvement in both restaurants and banqueting
business.
For the year 2016, the hotel achieved occupancy of
85.5% on an average of 297 available rooms (2015:
80.8% on an average of 341 available rooms) and an
average room rate of £304 (2015: £294).
NORTH AMERICA
The Langham, Boston
As business from the retail and group segments was
weak in the year, the hotel targeted at travellers
from the corporate segment, which helped the hotel
to deliver an 8% increase in average room rate in
2016. Nevertheless, the increase in demand from the
corporate segment was not enough to fully offset
the weaker demand from other segments, and the
hotel witnessed a decline in occupancy in 2016. On
the other hand, there was a moderate increase in
revenue from F&B, given a pickup in catering demand
and improved restaurant business. Note that phased
renovations of the hotel’s guestrooms will commence
from February 2017.
For the year 2016, the hotel achieved average
occupancy of 76.7% (2015: 84.0%) and an average
room rate of US$295 (2015: US$273).
The Langham Huntington, Pasadena
The hotel witnessed a strong return in demand from
high yielding group business in 2016, which helped
driving room rate for the hotel with average room rate
rose by 8%. However, as demand was soft from the
retail and the corporate segments, there was still a
small decline in the occupancy of the hotel in the year.
Revenue from F&B has improved, which was driven by
the increased catering business in corporate meetings
and conferences.
For the year 2016, the hotel achieved average
occupancy of 72.2% (2015: 73.7%) and an average
room rate of US$283 (2015: US$263).
The Langham, Chicago
Since the soft opening of the hotel in late 2013, the
hotel has firmly established itself as one of the most
luxurious hotels in Chicago. It was awarded with
a number of prestigious accolades in the lodging
industry, which has helped the hotel to further raise
its average room rate in 2016. With a steady mix of
demand from both corporate and retail travellers,
average room rate rose by 6% in 2016, whereas a
small increase in occupancy was achieved. Revenue
from F&B rose by 6% in the year, which was primarily
driven by the increased catering business in corporate
meetings and conferences.
For the year 2016, the hotel achieved occupancy of
70.9% (2015: 69.9%) and an average room rate of
US$372 (2015: US$352).
Langham Place, Fifth Avenue, New York
The performance of the hotel was impacted by the
room renovation that took place from January to May
2016, as well as the intense competition arising from
Airbnb in the New York hotel market. Nonetheless,
the completion of the refurbishment of two of the
suites has helped the hotel to capture demand from
the higher-yielding travellers, and as a result, there
was only a modest decline in average room rate in
2016. In view of the continued intense competition
in the market for large size accommodations, some
of the suites will be sub-divided to create an addition
of 20 standard rooms. The adaption work will start in
February 2017 with targeted completion in June 2017.
Revenue from F&B for the hotel declined by 21% in
2016, due to a lower revenue contributed by the bar
which was closed in April 2016, whereas catering
business was impacted by noise disruption from the
renovation works.
For the year 2016, the hotel achieved average
occupancy of 71.1% (2015: 74.5%) and an average
room rate of US$543 (2015: US$549).
Chelsea Hotel, Toronto
Following the completion of the room renovation in
2015, the hotel was well placed to capture the strong
demand from several large conventions, sport and
music events held in the city in 2016. This allowed the
hotel to deliver a growth in average room rate of 12%
in 2016, while occupancy also rose by 7 percentage
points. Revenue from F&B rose by 7%, driven by
stronger banqueting business.
For the year 2016, the hotel achieved average
occupancy of 77.0% (2015: 70.2%) and an average
room rate of C$153 (2015: C$137).
AUSTRALIA/NEW ZEALAND
The Langham, Melbourne
As there was a lack of large scale high profile events
in the city in 2016 compared with 2015, performance
of the hotel merely remained steady in the year. The
hotel managed to accommodate more travellers
from the retail segment, which helped to offset a
decline in demand from the corporate and group
segments. Revenue from F&B also declined as catering
business dropped, despite the satisfying performance
delivered by the all-day dining restaurant. Note that
refurbishment works of the guestrooms and common
area of the hotel will commence from the second
quarter of 2017.
For the year 2016, the hotel achieved occupancy of
86.2% (2015: 86.5) and an average room rate of
A$300 (2015: A$301).
The Langham, Sydney
Business of the hotel continued to ramp up subsequent
to its reopening in late 2014 after a major renovation. 
In spite of an ongoing rectification throughout
most of the year to meet the high standard of the
Langham brand, the hotel still managed to deliver an
improvement in both occupancy and average room
rate in 2016. The increase in demand was supported
by retail and corporate group segments. Revenue
from F&B was soft in 2016 despite the re-launch of
the restaurant has started to gain recognition in the
market.
For the year 2016, the hotel achieved occupancy of
68.0% on an average of 89 available rooms (2015:
63.2% on an average of 88 available rooms) and an
average room rate of A$435 (2015: A$415).
The Langham, Auckland
The hotel staged a good performance in 2016
which was underpinned by the buoyant local market
conditions. There was strong demand from travellers
from both retail and group segments, which enabled
the hotel to achieve higher occupancy and room rate
in the year. Revenue from F&B rose by 13% in 2016,
which was driven by an increase in revenue in both
restaurants and banquet business, as well as the low
base effect, as the function room for banqueting
business was closed for renovation in the first quarter
of 2015. Note that phased soft refurbishment of the
guestrooms is scheduled in 2017.
For the year 2016, the hotel achieved average
occupancy of 89.8% (2015: 83.5%) and an average
room rate of NZ$206 (2015: NZ$190).
CHINA
The Langham Xintiandi, Shanghai
As demand from the group segment was soft in 2016,
the hotel focused on demand from the retail leisure
business, which helped driving the occupancy of the
hotel. However, there was a decline in average room
rate in the year as retail leisure business commanded
lower room rates. Driven by improved business in
the Chinese restaurant, which was awarded with a
prestigious Michelin 3-star rating in the third quarter
of 2016, revenue from F&B also rose in 2016.
For the year 2016, the hotel achieved occupancy of
73.6% (2015: 70.8%) and an average room rate of
RMB1,716 (2015: RMB1,758).
HOTEL MANAGEMENT BUSINESS
As at the end of 2016, there are seven hotels with
approximately 2,200 rooms in our management
portfolio. As compared with the number of managed
hotels as at the end 2015, one long-term hotel
management contract was added to the growing
portfolio of hotels under management, the Langham
hotel in Haikou with 249 rooms.
DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
HONG KONG AND CHINA
Hotel in Shanghai, China
In 2015, the Group completed the acquisition of the
HUB hotel in bare shell condition and took possession
of the hotel. The HUB hotel is directly connected
to Shanghai’s Hongqiao transportation hub and is
situated within The HUB project, which comprises
offices, retail malls and F&B outlets built by another
developer. Fit-out works have started since 2016, and
the hotel under the Cordis brand with approximately
400 rooms is targeted to open in the first half of 2017.
Pak Shek Kok Residential Development Project
In May 2014, the Group successfully won the tender
of a 208,820 sq. ft. prime residential site in Pak Shek
Kok, Tai Po, Hong Kong. Based on a total permissible
gross floor area of 730,870 sq. ft. and HK$2,412
million paid for the site, this translated to a price of
HK$3,300 per sq. ft., and it was the lowest price paid
on a per sq. ft. basis for a residential site in the vicinity.
The site commands spectacularly unobstructed sea
views over Tolo Harbour and has been earmarked
for a luxury residential development with 700 to 800
residential units.
In terms of development progress, the General
Building Plan of the Project has been approved by
the Building Authority in January 2016. Foundation
works have been completed in August 2016, and
superstructure works are expected to start in mid2017.
Total development cost, including the payment
of HK$2,412 million for the site, is expected to be
approximately HK$7,000 million.
Dalian Mixed-use Development Project
The project is located on Renmin Road in the East
Harbour area of Zhongshan District, the central
business district of Dalian, Liaoning Province. It has a
total gross floor area of approximately 286,000 sq. m.
and comprises 1,200 high-end apartments and a
luxury hotel with approximately 360 rooms. The Group
has an equity interest in the project, investment in the
preferred shares of the project and acts as the project
manager. The project is developed in two phases,
Phase I comprises approximately 800 apartments and
Phase II comprises the remaining apartments and
the hotel. The Group’s share of net asset value in
the project, including HK$490 million invested in the
preferred shares of the project with a fixed rate of
return, was HK$971 million as at the end of 2016.
While the entire Phase I development is expected
to complete in 2018, the 800 apartments under
Phase I will be completed in batches, and the
pre-sold apartments will be handed to buyers once
they are completed. As at the end of 2016, 220
apartments of the first batch pre-sold apartments
were completed and handed to buyers. While there
was a development profit from the recognition of 220
apartments, such profit turned to a loss after providing
for a disproportionate share of the estimated land
appreciation tax for the project as a whole. As a result,
there was a after-tax loss of HK$7.5 million for our
interest in the project in 2016 results in relation to
the recognition of these 220 apartments. Our share
of the loss amounting to HK$7.5 million was included
under share of profits of joint ventures in the Group’s
2016 core profit. As mentioned in the Management
Discussion and Analysis as disclosed in our interim
report for the six months ended 30 June 2016, the low
return for the project was a result of the sluggish real
estate market in Dalian coupled with high construction
costs due to difficult construction management
conditions.
JAPAN
Tokyo Hotel Development Project
In June 2016, the Group had successfully completed
the acquisition of a hotel development site situated in
Roppongi, Tokyo for JPY22.2 billion. The site with an
estimated total building area of about 36,000 sq. m.
is located in close proximity to the landmark Roppongi
Hills Midtown, and construction on the site is
expected to start in 2018 following completion of the
demolition work on the existing buildings sometimes
in 2017. World renowned architect, Kengo Kuma
& Associates has been commissioned to design this
250-key flagship Langham Place Hotel in Central
Tokyo. Total investment cost, including the sum of
JPY22.2 billion to be paid for the site, is expected to be
approximately JPY48 billion and will be mostly funded
by bank loans with a low interest rate.
UNITED STATES
Hotel in Washington D.C., USA
The Group acquired a 265-key hotel in Washington,
D.C., USA in July 2014, for US$72 million. The hotel
is located in the heart of downtown Washington in
the proximity of the White House. The hotel has been
closed since 15 December 2014 for a major renovation
and will reopen as a brand new 260-key “Eaton”
hotel. The Eaton brand is the Group’s revamped
lifestyle brand that focuses on younger and more
socially oriented travellers. The layout and design for
the guest rooms have been confirmed, and renovation
is expected to start in the first half of 2017 and the
hotel is expected to open in late 2017.
San Francisco Hotel Development Project,
1125 Market Street
The Group acquired a site in San Francisco for
US$19.8 million in May 2015. The land located at 1125
Market Street was the last remaining vacant lot in
San Francisco’s Central Market district and is situated
opposite to San Francisco’s City Hall and numerous
cultural venues nearby. The Central Market area has
transformed rapidly in recent years amid increasing
presence interest from the global headquarters of
technology companies such as Twitter, Uber and
Square Dolby. The site has been earmarked for the
development of an “Eaton” hotel with a gross floor
area of approximately 125,000 sq. ft. It is planned to
be developed as a 150-key hotel, construction of the
project will start after development right of the hotel
is approved by the city’s planning department. The
famous AvroKO group has been commissioned as the
interior designer for this iconic Eaton Hotel project.
Currently, we expect development approval will be 
granted in 2017, and later than our original projection
of receiving the approval in late 2016 as we needed
more time in optimising the design of the hotel. The
opening of the hotel is now expected to be in 2020.
San Francisco Hotel Development Project,
555 Howard Street
555 Howard Street is a mixed-use development
project located right across the new Transbay Transit
Center, which is a US$4.5 billion transportation hub
in the heart of San Francisco’s emerging South of
Market business district. The Group has completed
the acquisition of this untitled site with an estimated
gross floor area of 430,000 sq. ft. for US$45.6 million
in April 2015. The project is expected to comprise a
luxury Langham Place hotel with approximately 240
rooms and approximately 65 condominiums with
100,000 net sq. ft. for-sale. The world renowned
international architect Renzo Piano Building Workshop
has been commissioned to design this prestigious
project. Construction of the project will start once
the development is approved by the city’s planning
department, which is expected to be in 2017/2018.
Seattle Development Project, 1931 Second
Avenue
The Group acquired a site in downtown Seattle for
US$18 million in December 2016. The site is located
at one of the highest points of downtown Seattle and
near the famous Pike Place market. The site has an
area of approximately 19,400 sq. ft. The site is entitled
for a 17-storey hotel. However, we shall explore other
available options to further enhance the development
of this site.
INCOME FROM CHAMPION REIT
The Group’s core profit is based on attributable
distribution income from Champion REIT in respect of
the same financial period. On that basis, total income
from Champion REIT in 2016 rose by 20.7% year-onyear
to HK$1,216.0 million. Whilst distribution per unit
declared by Champion REIT rose by 15.6% in 2016 as
compared with 2015, our attributable dividend income
from Champion REIT rose by 22.0% as compared
with 2015 as a result of our increased holdings in
Champion REIT. Management fee income, which
included asset management income from Champion
REIT, rose by 17.6% year-on-year to HK$344.4 million
in 2016.
The following texts were extracted from the annual
results announcement of Champion REIT for the year
of 2016 relating to the performance of the REIT’s
properties.
Three Garden Road
During 2016, occupancy of Three Garden Road
office stood at 95.9% at the end of 2016, improved
from 91.2% as at 31 December 2015. The growth
momentum in rental income continued throughout
2016, with the full year impact of the significant
improvement in occupancy in 2015 being recognised
this year. Rental income of the property for 2016
grew by 19.7% to HK$1,157 million compared with
HK$966 million last year. This considerable growth
was mainly due to the improvement in occupancy, as
well as moderate growth in passing rents, compared
with HK$75.39 per lettable sq. ft as at 31 December
2015, passing rents as at 31 December 2016 improved
to HK$78.20 per lettable sq. ft.. Net property income
for 2016 recorded a meaningful increase of 26.7% to
HK$1,040 million from HK$821 million in 2015.
Langham Place Office Tower
As well as maintaining full occupancy, the property
again achieved positive rental reversion. Total rental
income increased by 6.1% to HK$325 million for
2016, compared with HK$306 million for last year.
Passing rents recorded steady growth to HK$39.66 per
sq. ft. based on gross floor area as at 31 December
2016, compared with HK$37.50 per sq. ft. as at
31 December 2015. Due to higher tenancy turnover in
2016, rental commissions for the property increased
by HK$5 million, with net property operating expenses
rising by HK$7 million as a result. Net property
income increased by 4.1% to HK$295 million from
HK$283 million in 2015.
Langham Place Mall
Total rental income of the Mall increased by
3.4% to HK$817 million in 2016, compared with
HK$790 million in 2015. Passing base rents grew to
HK$178.74 per sq. ft. (based on lettable area) as at
31 December 2016 compared with HK$174.54 per
sq. ft. as at 31 December 2015. Tenants’ sales in
the Mall reduced 4.9% year-on-year during 2016,
narrowing from a 6.4% decline in the first half of the
year and again outperforming the Hong Kong overall
retail sales figures, which declined 8.1% in 2016.
However, the slowdown in tenants’ retail sales has
negatively affected the turnover rent portion. Turnover
rent for 2016 declined to HK$86 million, compared
with HK$92 million for 2015. Net property income
increased marginally by 1.8% to HK$692 million,
compared with HK$680 million in 2015.
INVESTMENT IN LHI
On statutory accounting basis, our investment in
LHI is classified as a subsidiary, and its results are
consolidated into the Group’s statutory income
statement. However, as LHI is principally focused on
distributions, the Group’s core profit will be derived
from the attributable distribution income after the
impact of dividend waived, as we believe this will
better reflect the financial return and economic
interest attributable to our investment in LHI. This
entry is also consistent with our practice in accounting
for returns from our investment in Champion REIT,
which also focuses on distributions.
In 2016, there was an increase in the hotels’ revenue
as overnight arrivals to Hong Kong stabilises and there
were more available rooms in LHI’s hotel portfolio
after the renovations in 2015. Furthermore, as the
Group has increased its holdings in LHI, these have
resulted in a 9.1% year-on-year increase in distribution
income from LHI. The distribution has already taken
into account distribution entitlement in respect of our
100 million share stapled units held for 2016. The
number of distribution waiver units will drop to 50
million share stapled units for the financial year 2017,
and all of our holdings will be entitled to receive
distribution payable from 2018 onwards.
It was a gesture by the Group, as a major investor of
LHI to waive part of its distributions so as to minimise
dilution impact on initial yield to other investors. The
dilution arose from additional units issued at the time
of the initial public offering. The additional capital has
been raised to fund asset enhancement initiatives on
the initial portfolio, which should help support value
of the properties of LHI going forward.
Great Eagle Centre
The occupancy of the Great Eagle Centre dropped
from 98.2% as at the end of 2015 to 95.3% as at the
end of 2016, as a majority of the incremental increase
in available area are reserved for the Group’s in-house
expansion, which will be occupied by the Group since
the first half of 2017. Otherwise, occupancy of the
Great Eagle Centre would be stable as at the end of
2016 as compared with last year. Meanwhile, spot
rents at the Great Eagle Centre rose from the midHK$60s
per sq. ft. on lettable area as at the end of
2015 to around HK$70s per sq. ft. as at the end of
2016. As a result, there was a 2.2% growth in average
passing rent for the leased office space at the Great
Eagle Centre, which increased from HK$64.8 per
sq. ft. on lettable area as at 31 December 2015 to
HK$66.2 per sq. ft. as at 31 December 2016.
Overall gross rental income for the Great Eagle Centre,
which included retail rental income and other income,
dropped by 2.6% to HK$139.6 million in 2016, which
was mainly attributable to the absence of rental
income after the expiry of a lease for a large signage
space since late 2015. On the other hand, net rental
income increased by 3.2% to HK$137.2 million in
2016 given a higher cost base for comparison in 2015,
when additional maintenance capital expenditure was
incurred.
Eaton Serviced Apartments
There was an increase in the overall occupancy of
the three serviced apartments, which increased from
75.8% in 2015 to 78.8% in 2016. The increase was
driven primarily by the improved occupancy of the
serviced apartment at the Village Road property,
which had a low level of occupancy in 2015 due
to scaffolding and facelift works that negatively
impacted demand. The Wanchai Gap Road property
also benefitted from the increased demand from
the leisure segment which boosted its occupancy,
while performance of the Blue Pool Road property
was negatively impacted by nearby competitions and
achieved lower occupancy in 2016.
However, as competitions remain keen, average net
passing rent for the three serviced apartments was
only flat in 2016 and remained at HK$48.2 per sq. ft.
on gross floor area in 2016. Gross rental income rose
by 8.5% to HK$51.2 million in 2016, whereas net
rental income increased by 10.8% to HK$31.7 million
in 2016.
The U.S. Fund
As part of the Group’s effort to expand our assetlight
asset management business, the Group has
established a U.S. Real Estate Fund in 2014, which
targets at office and residential property investments
in the United States. As at the end of 2016, the Group
held 49.97% interest in the U.S. Fund and acts as
the fund’s key asset manager with a 80% stake in
the asset management company, and the remaining
interest was held by China Orient Asset Management
(International) Holding Limited.
While the financials of the U.S. Fund are consolidated
into the Group’s financial statements under statutory
accounting principles, the Group’s core profit is based
on distribution received from the U.S. Fund, as well as
our share of asset management fee income from the
U.S. Fund. The Group’s core balance sheet is based
on our share of net asset in the U.S. Fund. Since the
establishment of the U.S. Fund, other than properties
transferred by the Group which have been sold with
a strong return in 2016, the U.S. Fund had acquired
several projects and updates of which are as follows.
The Austin
The site, located at 1545 Pine Street, San Francisco
was acquired for US$21 million in January 2015.
The site is situated in the trendy Polk Street
neighbourhood, in proximity to the traditional luxury
residential areas of Nob Hill and Pacific Heights. The
development with gross floor area of approximately
135,000 sq. ft. will comprise 100 studio and one- and
two-bedroom residences. Total investment cost for
the project, including the US$21 million paid for the
site, is expected to be approximately US$83 million.
Construction work on the site has started in the first
quarter of 2016 and the topping off of the building
was celebrated in November 2016. The project is
targeted for completion in the second half of 2017.
Soft marketing on the sale of this condominium
project has begun in the second quarter of 2016, and
the project will be officially launched in early 2017.
Cavalleri, Malibu
The acquisition of the residential property in Malibu,
California was completed in September 2015 for 
US$62 million. The strategy is to reposition its 68 rental
apartment units into high-end for-sale condominiums.
Malibu is a sought-after high-end coastal residential
area in Los Angeles, where regulatory development
constraints establish high barriers to entry and
currently no similar competing properties are available
for sale or under development. Renovation works has
commenced since the second quarter of 2016 after
vacant possession of all units had been taken. Soft
marketing on the sale of the apartment units has
begun in the second quarter of 2016, whereas the
formal launch of the project will be in the first half of
2017.
Dexter Horton
The office building in Seattle the U.S. Fund had
acquired is known as the Dexter Horton Building, a
historic building named after the founder of Seattle
First Bank. It is a 15-storey building with a rentable
floor area of 336,355 sq. ft. and is located at 710
Second Avenue in Seattle’s central business district.
The building was acquired by the U.S. Fund for
US$124.5 million in September 2015.
In 2016, as the asset manager of the U.S. Fund,
we have sold the Fund’s three office towers in San
Francisco for a very attractive return, and resulted
in a distribution income from the U.S. Fund of
HK$280.6 million attributable to our interest in the
Fund in 2016. The Group also booked a disposal gain
to reflect the deferred profit when we transferred the
office buildings to the U.S. Fund in 2014. Furthermore,
the Group booked HK$89.6 million (2015: HK$44.0
million) in asset and property fee income from the U.S.
Fund, which was included under “Other Operations”
in the Group’s operating income. The significant
increase in asset and property fee income was due
to the booking of a disposal fee income, which was
based on the sale price of the disposed properties.
FINANCIAL REVIEW
DEBT
On statutory basis, after consolidating the
results of Champion REIT, LHI and the U.S. Fund,
the consolidated net debts of the Group as of
31 December 2016 was HK$21,589 million, an
increase of HK$1,132 million compared to that as
of 31 December 2015. The increase in reported net
borrowings at the balance sheet date was mainly due
to payment of a special dividend and new bank loans
for financing the acquisition of a property in Japan and
development of a project in Pak Shek Kok.
Equity Attributable to Shareholders, based on
professional valuation of the Group’s investment
properties as of 31 December 2016 and the
depreciated costs of the Group’s hotel properties
(including Hong Kong hotel properties held by LHI),
amounted to HK$55,847 million, representing an
increase of HK$1,514 million compared to the value
of HK$54,333 million as of 31 December 2015. The
increase was mainly attributable to profit for the year,
increase in share premium from additional shares
issued under employee share option scheme and after
offsetting by dividends paid out and exchange loss
from translating foreign entities during the year.
For statutory accounts reporting purpose, on
consolidation the Group is treated as to include entire
debts of Champion REIT, LHI and the U.S. Fund.
Based on the consolidated net debts attributable to
the Group (i.e only 65.50%, 61.90% and 49.97%
of the net debts of Champion REIT, LHI and the
U.S. Fund respectively) and equity attributable to
shareholders, the gearing ratio of the Group as at
31 December 2016 was 24.9%. Since the debts of
these three subsidiary groups had no recourse to the
Group, we consider it is more meaningful to account
for the Group’s own net debts instead of attributable
consolidated net debts against the Group’s sharing of
net assets of those subsidiaries, and the resulting net
position is illustrated below.
The following analysis is based on the statutory
consolidated financial statements:
INDEBTEDNESS
Our gross debts (including medium term note) after
consolidating Champion REIT, LHI and the U.S. Fund
amounted to HK$28,369 million as of 31 December
2016. Foreign currency gross debts as of 31 December
2016 amounted to the equivalent of HK$8,897 million,
of which the equivalent of HK$2,996 million or 34%
was on fixed-rate basis.
FINANCE COST
The net consolidated finance cost including borrowing
cost capitalised for property under development during
the year was HK$598 million. Overall interest cover at
the reporting date was 5.6 times.
LIQUIDITY AND DEBT MATURITY PROFILE
As of 31 December 2016, our cash, bank deposits
and undrawn loan facilities amounted to a total of
HK$6,898 million. The majority of our loan facilities
are secured by properties with sufficient value to loan
coverage. The following is a profile of the maturity of
our outstanding gross debts (including medium term
note) as of 31 December 2016:
Within 1 year 8.8%
1–2 years 6.4%
3–5 years 71.0%
Over 5 years 13.8%
PLEDGE OF ASSETS
At 31 December 2016, properties of the Group with a
total carrying value of approximately HK$54,923 million
(31 December 2015: HK$64,691 million), US dollars
and HK dollars deposit with equivalent amount of
HK$631 million (31 December 2015: HK$621 million)
were mortgaged or pledged to secure credit facilities
granted to its subsidiaries.
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
At 31 December 2016, the Group has authorised
capital expenditure for investment properties and
property, plant and equipment which is not provided
for in these consolidated financial statements
amounting to HK$3,135 million (31 December 2015:
 HK$1,308 million) of which HK$442 million
(31 December 2015: HK$292 million) has been
contracted for.
At 31 December 2016, the Group has outstanding
financial commitment in respect of capital
injection to a joint venture of RMB25.8 million
(equivalent to HK$33 million) (31 December 2015:
RMB25.8 million) and cash commitment to the China
Fund of US$46 million (equivalent to HK$357 million)
(31 December 2015: US$46 million).
Other than that, the Group did not have any
significant commitments and contingent liabilities at
the end of the reporting period.
OUTLOOK
Among the outcomes of major geopolitical events
in 2016, it was the unexpected presidential election
results in the U.S. that could set the stage for
significant changes in the global economy in 2017.
If drastic changes in trade and foreign policies are
pushed through in the U.S., they could have serious
negative implications for global economic growth.
At the same time, we should not underestimate the
adverse impacts arising from higher U.S. interest
rates on the global economy as global financial
conditions may tighten. Other geopolitical events
like the elections in Eurozone, slightly uncertain
China economy, and the Middle East problems can
also cause volatility in world markets and economic
conditions. Overall, macro conditions could become
more challenging going forward, and we must stay
vigilant and be ready to respond to any slowdown in
our business.
As for the Hotels Division, the opening of the Cordis
hotel in Hongqiao, Shanghai in the first half of 2017
and the Eaton hotel in Washington D.C. in late 2017
will mark another key milestone in our long term
plan to expand our global footprint and international
brand recognition. However, the associated one-off
pre-opening expenses will also be booked in 2017. In
addition, renovations of different scale of the Group’s
certain hotels will also have a negative impact on
the EBITDA of the overseas hotels division in 2017.
Nonetheless, in the longer term we expect there will
be further improvements in the EBITDA of the ramped
up and renovated hotels, which should help to offset
much of the negative impact arising from the hotel
renovations and the pre-opening expenses to be
recognised.
For hotels in Hong Kong, although Rev PARs of Hong
Kong’s hotels have largely stabilised in 2016, worrying
signs including the recent strength of the Hong Kong
dollar are emerging once again in 2017 which may
affect demand for hotel rooms. For LHI, the phased
refurbishment of the ballroom and dining area at the
Eaton, Hong Kong from mid-2017 will result in lower
F&B and possibly room revenue in 2017. In addition,
higher interest expense and cash tax payment due to
depletion of tax loss carry forward will result in lower
distributable income for LHI in 2017.
For Champion REIT, after achieving a respectable
growth and a record high in distributable income in
2016, rental income growth momentum is expected
to moderate in the coming year. At the property
portfolio level, Three Garden Road and Langham
Place Office should continue to deliver growth in
2017, however, Langham Place Mall is expected to
encounter downside risk in rental reversion. The overall
rental income from the existing properties portfolio is
expected to be stable in 2017.
Not only will the softer performance of our core
business weigh on the core profit of 2017. The
recognition of a major asset disposal gain in 2016
has also materially raised the base for comparison for
the 2017’s core profit, which might result in a decline
in core profit for 2017. Nonetheless, the prudent
and targeted expansion strategy that we have put
in place over the past several years should drive the
Group’s long term earnings growth. Meanwhile, we
are well placed to pursue acquisitions, as we have a
strong balance sheet, and we will continue to explore
value-added investments in global markets where
asset values are cyclically suppressed.
