CHAIRMAn s stAteMent 
It gives me a great pleasure to write my first statement as Chairman of Sun Art Retail Group ltd, and to share with you our first Annual Report as a listed company.
Our successful IPO on 27 July 2011 has established for us a sound footing to pursue our vision: Sell more and more quality products to more and more customers at lower and lower prices . We believe our vision to be particularly fitting in a context where the Chinese government has established the increase of internal demand and the control of inflation as priorities.
Our employees share this vision and the Group values: Trust, Progress, Sharing . We believe that by creating a team which is as close as a family, honest, dedicated, innovative, healthy and cheerful, they will ensure a high level of customer satisfaction, translating into high levels of performance for the Group.
Our Board, which reflects the diversity and the history of our two banners and combines strong retail experience and understanding of China s operating environment, is committed, through its governance processes, to provide guidance to our management team to continue to grow at a sustained rate, to further improve its operational effectiveness and to deliver better financial performance.
