In general, 2007 is expected to follow this trend, albeit at a slightly reduced pace. The pricing momentum experienced by the Group s hotels is expected to continue through 2007 giving scope to further improve operating margins.

Barring any major adverse developments, the Group remains optimistic about its financial performance for 2007.
