Chairman s Statement On behalf of the board of directors (the Board ), I am pleased to present the annual results of Climax International Company Limited (the Company ) and its subsidiaries (the Group ) for the financial year ended 31 March 2010.
The primary goal of the Board is to formulate a proposal for resumption of the trading of the shares of the Company so as to protect the interest of the Company and its shareholders as a whole. In light of the tough economic climate and unsatisfactory financial performance of the paper products business, the Group has disposed of this segment during the year. Upon the disposal, more resources are allocated to the electronic products business. For the year ended 31 March 2010, the Group has recorded approximately HK$167 million turnover from the electronic products business. The Group will continue to broaden the customer base and enhance the products quality so as to improve the performance of the Group.
I would like to take this opportunity to deliver my most sincere gratitude to the board members and management team for their devoted commitments during the year and look forward to their continuous support in the years to come.
