CHAIRMAN S STATEMENT 
On behalf of Hengan International Group Company Limited ( Hengan International or the Group ), I present its annual results for the year ended 31 December 2013.
During the year under review, both Europe and the United States experienced gradual economic recovery while China maintained steady economic growth by stepping up a series of measures. Continuing economic growth and urbanization boosted personal incomes in both the urban and rural areas of China, and led to rising living standard and awareness of hygiene. This is conducive to the development of markets for high-quality personal and household hygiene products, for which Hengan International is well known as an industry leader in the country. The Group leverages its solid fundamentals, strong brand and economies of scale, and adopts effective cost control measures to cope with the changes in the market environment. With these advantages, the Group seeks steady business growth by capturing the opportunities in the flourishing market.
For the year ended 31 December 2013, the Group s revenue rose by about 14.4% to approximately HK$21,186,368,000 (2012: HK$18,524,233,000).
Profit attributable to shareholders increased by about 5.8% to approximately HK$3,721,031,000 (2012: HK$3,518,705,000). Basic earnings per share were approximately HK$3.024 (2012: HK$2.863). The Board of Directors recommended the payment of a final dividend of HK$1.00 per share (2012: HK$0.95), which together with the interim dividend of HK$0.85 per share (2012 1H: HK$0.75), brings the annual dividend to HK$1.85 per share (2012: HK$1.70).
During the year, the tissue paper business continued to be the Group s major revenue source, accounting for approximately 48.2% of its total revenue. The businesses of sanitary napkin and disposable diaper recorded satisfactory growth, and accounted for approximately 28.2% and 13.9% respectively of the Group s total revenue. Food and snacks products business has regained growth momentum, accounting for 7.6% of the Group s total revenue.
With integrity, diligence, innovation and dedication as its corporate values, Hengan International aims to provide better personal and household hygiene products to the general public and improve the quality of life through product innovation and business expansion. In 2013, the Group was listed as Forbes Asia s Fabulous 50 and Top 500 Private Firms for 2013 in recognition of its outstanding performance and market position.
Looking ahead to 2014, we expect that the imminent economic recovery in Europe and the United States will lead to the revival of global trade and economic development, and will also benefit China s economy.
Consistent growth in personal income and accelerating urbanization will also pave the way for the growth in China s market for personal hygiene products. In addition, China starts to relax its one-child policy, and the move s beneficial effects on the baby products market will gradually become manifest from the fourth quarter of 2014 onwards. To seize the opportunity in the growing market, the Group will continue to step up product promotion and develop markets with good potential. With our extensive distribution network and proactive business expansion strategy, the Group is confident of maintaining steady growth and its industry leadership in China on the back of the country s steady economic growth.
I would like to express my gratitude to every member of staff for their continuous effort that contributed to the growth of Hengan International in the year under review. I would also like to thank the shareholders for their enduring support, trust and recognition of the Group s development strategies and aspirations. In return, the entire staff of Hengan International will continue to work hard to generate higher shareholder value.
