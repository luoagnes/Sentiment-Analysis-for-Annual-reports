The Group carries an optimistic view to its core businesses. Economic growth of Mainland China is expected to continue taking the lead. While the Central Government is likely to continue monitoring the property market through her macro policies, such policies will serve to ensure sustainable growth of the property market. In addition, the Central Government s consistent policy of promoting investments and growth of her western cities is also positive factor to our projects in Chengdu. We expect the sales of such projects to continue performing satisfactorily.
The financial sector has rebounded strongly since the third quarter of last year, with aggressive plans to taking up expansion space. We expect to see occupancies to lift further for the Group s office portfolio this year.
Meanwhile, retailers have also continued seeking prominent locations for new outlets to capture affluent customers and tourist shoppers. Our new shopping centre, The ONE, has become a spotlight for retailers since pre- leasing commenced, and will bring a fresh outlook to the shopping arena in Tsim Sha Tsui when it opens.
Our Group has been monitoring the property markets of Hong Kong and Mainland China closely, and will replenish its land bank and expand its investment property portfolio at opportune times.
The Board will continue to review the share price of the Company and its underlying net asset value regularly and consider repurchase its shares on the Stock Exchange, as and when the share price represents a significant discount to its net asset value.
