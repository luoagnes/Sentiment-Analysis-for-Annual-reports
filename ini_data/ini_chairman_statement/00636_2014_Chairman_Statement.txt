C H A I R M A N S S T A T E M E N T E N E R G I S E D F O R G R E A T E R G R O W T H 2013 was a good year for Kerry Logistics, ending with our IPO before Christmas. We raised US$327 million, the largest by market capitalisation for a Hong Kong company last year. The success of the IPO reflected the capital market s confidence in our growth prospects in Greater China and ASEAN.
Our results for 2013 met the commitment we made at our listing. In 2013, Kerry Logistics recorded core net profit of HK$886.4 million and turnover of HK$19,968.7 million.
These were up 8.7% over HK$815.7 million and up 3.5% over HK$19,294.8 million respectively in 2012.
These results are only possible because of the many years of investment in our people and in a wide range of capabilities in Greater China, ASEAN and beyond. Going forward, we will continue to emphasise people and capabilities. In this way, we will continue to serve our customers well, helping them improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their global supply chains.
Our tagline is Asia Specialist, China Focus, Global Network. Our origin and deep strength in Asia position us uniquely for future growth as Asia s leading 3PL service
