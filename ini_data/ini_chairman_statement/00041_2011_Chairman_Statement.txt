CHAIRMAN S STATEMENT In addition to the bookings of non-trading items like the increase in fair value of the Group s investment properties, the Group s reported statutory profit in 2010 was significantly lifted by the share of results of Champion REIT, as our investment in the REIT was reclassified as an associate company from 23 July 2010. However, in order to provide the same basis for comparison, the Group s core profit will be based on dividend received from Champion REIT, which is consistent with past practices.

Continued improvement was witnessed in our overall businesses in 2010 as the global economic recovery gathered pace. Core profit increased 26.0% from HK$1,275.7 million in 2009 to HK$1,607.0 million in 2010.
The key driver was our hotels business, where operating income increased 53.8% from HK$428.8 million in 2009 to HK$659.6 million in 2010. Net rental income from investment properties increased 9% from HK$164.2 million in 2009 to HK$179.1 million in 2010. Income from Champion REIT increased 1.3% from HK$848.2 million in 2009 to HK$858.9 million in 2010. The profit for 2010 was also aided by an increase of HK$124.6 million in other income, which included a one-time gain of HK$220.1 million arising from the buy-back at a discount of the debts associated with the Pasadena hotel and the office property at 2700 Ygnacio in California.

The recovery in business and leisure travel gained momentum in 2010. The Hong Kong hotels moved from strength to strength as the strong growth in tourist arrivals continued, leading to healthy increases in occupancy rates at all three hotels. Gross revenue for Hong Kong rose 13.2% from HK$1,113.4 million in 2009 to HK$1,260.3 million in 2010. At the hotels outside of Hong Kong, the performance had been uneven at different countries. While London turned around solidly after the completion of a major renovation, our hotels in the U.S. generally lagged behind in terms of their pace of recovery. However revenue from our hotels outside of Hong Kong, coming off a low base of 2009, increased by 28.5% in 2010. Total revenue of the Hotels Division increased 22.4% year-on-year to HK$3,269.4 million in 2010.
EBITDA from the Hotels Division rose 53.8% year-on-year to HK$659.6 million in 2010. The major contributor was Hong Kong, which generated HK$412.5 million in 2010, a 17.9% growth over the prior year. At the hotels outside of Hong Year ended 31 December 2010 2009 Change

The key factor there was the renewed profit contribution from The Langham London, which was operating at closer to its full inventory with 350 rooms in 2010 and achieved a higher occupancy thereof. EBITDA from the Hotels Division would have been higher, had there not been a one-off provision associated with the rebranding of the Xintiandi hotel in 
In 2010, there were three additions to the hotel portfolio, namely, the 204-room Eaton Luxe in Nanqiao, Shanghai, the 376-room Langham Place, Beijing Capital Airport and the 357-room The Langham, Xintiandi, Shanghai. The first two hotels are operated under pure hotel management contracts, whereas the Group has a one-third equity stake in the Xintiandi property.
Continuing our strategy of building the global franchise of the Langham brand, we have in December 2010 acquired a 100% interest in a 330-room hotel redevelopment project in downtown Chicago. The redevelopment is currently scheduled for completion in 2013 and the hotel is expected to be branded a Langham. This investment is supported by its bottom-of-the-cycle valuation and is part of the Group s strategy to own hotels in strategic gateway cities that will anchor our hotel brand.
Hong Kong Hotels The Langham, Hong Kong The trend in corporate activities remained robust in 2010.
The increased demand for hotel rooms, and hence a higher Chuan Spa at Langham Place, Mongkok, Hong Kong level of occupancy, enabled the Hotel to raise room rates, especially in the higher-yield retail business. However, heightened competition in the market has led to slower banquet business, especially from the wedding segment.
Nevertheless, with increased covers and average spend in the restaurants, revenue from food and beverage in 2010 managed to remain in line with 2009.
For the year 2010, the hotel achieved an average occupancy of 80% (2009: 73%) and average room rate of HK$1,779 (2009: HK$1,575 re-based*).

Langham Place, Mongkok, Hong Kong Room revenue was boosted by corporate and leisure travel, with significant pick up in average room rate in the last quarter of 2010. Corporate functions and the strong performance of the restaurants contributed to an 8% growth in food and beverage revenue in 2010, notwithstanding a slow down in wedding banquet business due to increased 
For the year 2010, the hotel achieved an average occupancy of 85% (2009: 76%) and average room rate of HK$1,487 (2009: HK$1,324 re-based).
Eaton Smart, Hong Kong The hotel unveiled its renovated lobby and restaurants in the fourth quarter of 2010 and was re-branded as Eaton Smart Hong Kong. Active demand for rooms from both corporate and retail travellers allowed the Hotel to further increase its occupancy and to raise room rates towards the latter part of 2010. For the full year in 2010, Revenue Par Available Room ( RevPAR ) increased by 27% year-on-year to reach HK$782. On the other hand, with slower banqueting demand from the wedding segment, as well as closure of restaurants during the hotel renovation in the third quarter of 2010, revenue from food and beverage dropped by 12% year-on-year in 2010.
For the year 2010, the hotel achieved an average occupancy of 87% (2009: 78%) and average room rate of HK$900 (2009: HK$794 re-based).
Hotels Outside of Hong Kong The Langham, London Following the major renovations of the previous two years, the hotel managed a major turnaround in 2010. The hotel traded with an average rooms availability of 350 in 2010, as compared to 284 rooms in 2009. Capitalising on a citywide recovery and the repositioning of the hotel, strong revenue gains were achieved in 2010. The hotel saw a gain in occupancy rates on the enlarged rooms base. At the same time, it managed a 15% increase in average room rates in 2010 on better penetration in the higher-yield retail and

The Langham, Boston After a slow start in 2010, a gradual increase in number of citywide conventions in Boston was witnessed. The increase in meeting and conference business, as well as an increase in corporate and roadshow activities from the financial sector led to a 9 percentage points gain in occupancy for Langham Boston for 2010 over that of 2009. However, due to continued market competition, average room rate grew only moderately in 2010. Revenue from food and beverage 
For the year 2010, the hotel achieved an average occupancy of 68% (2009: 59%) and average room rate of US$219 (2009: US$213).
The Langham, Melbourne The hotel was undergoing room renovation during August to October 2010. Therefore there was an average of 372 rooms available in 2010, as compared to 387 rooms in 2009. In the face of new supply of hotel rooms in the market, average room rate declined only 3% year-on-year, but occupancy rose 13 percentage points due to steady demand in retail and corporate business. Revenue from food and beverage increased by 13% year-on-year in 2010, and was supported by increase in both average check and covers. Completion of the first phase of room refurbishment in the fourth quarter of 2010 is expected to help the hotel capture market share and strengthen room rates.
For the year 2010, the hotel achieved occupancy of 80% on an average of 372 rooms (2009: 67% on an average of 387 rooms) and an average room rate of A$252 (2009: A$260).
The Langham, Auckland Mild increases in room rates and occupancy were observed for Langham Auckland in 2010. The improvement was primarily on the back of increased market share for the Hotel in a stable lodging industry for Auckland in 2010. The re- opening of the ballroom in March 2010 helped drove revenue from food and beverage, which increased 65% year-on-year in 2010.
For the year December 2010, the hotel achieved an occupancy of 66% (2009: 62%) and an average room rate of NZ$174 (2009: NZ$168).
The Langham Huntington, Pasadena, Los Angeles Stagnant market conditions, and hence a shortage of meetings and conference business, continued to impact the performance on the Hotel in 2010. There were modest gains in both occupancy and achieved room rates in 2010.
However they remained at relatively low levels, which were unable to turn a profit for the hotel in 2010.

With its modern design and high-profile location at the entrance to the bustling shopping and entertainment hub of Xintiandi, the hotel has been able to capture higher-yield retail and group business despite its recent opening. Demand for banqueting services from the corporate segment has also been encouraging.
Delta Chelsea Hotel, Toronto The performance of the hotel has improved since the second quarter of 2010, with the return of leisure travel and large citywide events.

Champion REIT is a real estate investment trust formed to own and invest in an income-producing portfolio of commercial properties primarily in Asia.
Currently, Champion REIT owns approximately 2.2 million sq. ft. of grade A office space and 650,000 sq. ft. of prime retail space in Hong Kong.
The trust s assets are located in Citibank Plaza, in Central on Hong Kong Island and Langham Place, an integrated project in the commercial district of Mongkok, on the 
Income from Champion REIT As mentioned at the beginning of this Management s Discussion and Analysis, due to the reclassification of our investment in Champion REIT as an associate company from 23 July 2010, the share of results from Champion REIT from 23 July 2010 were included in the Group s statutory profit. In addition, given this is a transitional year, distributions received over the second half of 2009 and first half of 2010 were also included. However, to provide the same basis for comparison, the Group s core profit is based on dividend received from Champion REIT, which is consistent with past practices.
Due to the Group s accounting policy of recognizing distribution income from Champion REIT at the date of payment of the distribution, the income statement of the Group for a six-month period reflects the distribution declared by the Champion REIT for the immediately preceding six-month period. Therefore the income statement for 2010 recognised the distributions made by Champion REIT for the second half of 2009 and the first half of 2010. On that basis, distribution income from Champion REIT increased by 3.1% year-on-year to HK$597.0 million.
On the other hand, management fee income from Champion REIT decreased 2.7% year-on-year from HK$269.3 million in 2009 to HK$261.9 million in 2010, reflecting a decline in asset management fee in line with the lower net property income at Citibank Plaza.

There was a recovery in the office leasing market in Central in 2010 as financial institutions gradually reversed their trend of downsizing. The arrival of a significant number of fund management companies to capitalize on China investment opportunities, together with the supporting legal trade, generated substantial demand. However, occupancy rate at Citibank Plaza decreased from 87.6% at the beginning of the year to 81.5% as at the end of 2010, because of earlier competition from some other landlords who offered long- term fixed-rate leases at relatively low rents. Passing rental rates (the average rental rate of existing contracted tenancies) at Citibank Plaza weakened in the first half of 2010 but stabilized at the HK$84-85 per sq. ft. level for the 
Langham Place Office Tower Leasing conditions for the offices at Langham Place have been stable. The Office Tower had a slightly higher occupancy rate of 99.4% as of 31 December 2010, as compared to 98.5% a year ago. This was notwithstanding the expiry of 35% of leases by floor area during the year and the strong price competition from new supply in the peripheral districts in Kowloon East. Langham Place s MTR location and the outstanding quality of the building have been important factors in retaining tenants and maintaining a high occupancy. For 2010, passing rents were stable and continued to remain within a narrow range centered around HK$26.50 per sq. ft.
Langham Place Mall Despite the opening of a few new shopping malls in nearby Tsim Sha Tsui, the convenient location of the Langham Place Mall, its attractive shop offerings and its well conceived and executed marketing programmes ensured its status as one of the most popular shopping malls in Kowloon, among local shoppers and tourists alike. The Mall enjoyed very high levels of foot traffic and remained virtually fully let throughout 2010. Driven by a constantly improving mix of quality retailers and a robust retail market, the average sales per sq. ft. of the shops in the Mall improved by 18% year on year. The surge in spending by Mainland tourists, who now consider Langham Place one of their favourite destinations, on cosmetics and fashion has also been a major factor behind the growth. The average passing rent rate increased from HK$88.61 per sq. ft. at the beginning of 2010 to HK$97.48 at year-end.

Dalian mixed-use development project Progress at our mixed-use development project in Dalian, which comprises of approximately 1,200 high-rise luxury apartments and a 361-room Langham-branded luxury hotel, has been moving forward generally in accordance with our initial plan. The excavation works which commenced in the third quarter of 2010 is expected to finish in the first quarter of 2011, whereupon the foundation works will begin. Up to the end of December 2010, the Group has invested HK$520 million in respect of its 50% stake in the project.

Great Eagle Centre The lack of new supply in the Wanchai area, the relocation of cost-sensitive tenants from Central, coupled with strong demand from the service sector and Mainland Chinese companies have kept the office portion of Great Eagle Centre at close to full occupancy throughout 2010. With the strong occupancy, we were able to progressively raise spot rents through 2010 from the high HK$40 s per sq. ft. at the beginning of the year to high HK$50 s towards the end of 
As the leases due for renewal in 2010 had been written during the last peaks of 2007 and 2008, when market rents were higher than those of 2010, there was therefore a small amount of negative rent rate reversion in 2010. Average passing rent at Great Eagle Centre at the end of December 2010 was 2% lower than that achieved at the beginning of the year. However, gross rental income increased by 4.2% year-on-year to HK$105.5 million in 2010 due to the higher average occupancy, as well as full year rental income contribution from an anchor tenant whose lease was renewed at a higher rental rate than its previous lease in the second quarter of 2009.
Net rental income rose 13.9% year-on-year to HK$102.2 million due to lower vacancy costs and a lower base for comparison, as net rental income in 2009 was impacted by booking of additional expenses related to the relocation and upgrading of the cooling water pumping facilities.
Eaton Serviced Apartments The Eaton serviced apartments have benefitted from increased business activities and inflow of expatriates to Hong Kong in 2010 with generally higher occupancy. Rental rates achieved in the second half of 2010 at the Wanchai Gap Road and Village Road properties posted year-on-year growth in 2010. Occupancy also rose at the Blue Pool Road property, but the average rental rate achieved in the second half of 2010 was still lower than that achieved over the prior year, although the year-on-year decline in rental rates has 
Overall, average occupancy rate at the three properties rose 22 percentage points year-on-year to 78.5% in 2010, whereas rental rates achieved dropped by 12% year-on- year to HK$33.6 per sq. ft over 2010. Gross rental income increased 20.9% year-on-year to HK$34.9 million, whereas net rental income increased 37.3% year-on-year to HK$23.9 million on the back of aggressive cost control.
United States Properties All of our three properties in the U.S. have maintained their high occupancy levels throughout 2010 through renewal and new lettings, despite the sluggish demand for office space from the corporate sector in the area. Overall occupancy for the portfolio stood at 90% as at the end of 2010, whereas average rent rate achieved came in steady at US$36.4 per sq. ft for 2010. With full year rental income contribution from tenants secured in 2009 and higher occupancy at the Sacramento property, gross rental income for our U.S. properties increased by 3.1% year-on-year to HK$117.7 million in 2010. However, due to increased tenant inducement costs associated with the new lettings at 500 Ygnacio and 2700 Ygnacio, net rental income declined by 7.8% year-on-year to HK$46.7 million in 2010.

Gross debts denominated in HK dollars amounted to HK$1,316 million as of 31 December 2010. Our foreign currency gross debts as of 31 December 2010 amounted to the equivalent of HK$2,168 million, of which the equivalent of HK$499 million, or 23.0% of our foreign currency debts, was on fixed-rate basis. Net of cash and bank deposits that matures within 3 months totalling the equivalent of HK$1,553 million, our consolidated net debt outstanding as of 31 December 2010 was HK$1,931 million, an decrease of HK$661 million from that of HK$2,592 million as of 31 
Because of the persistent low interest rate environment and in order to enhance return to shareholders, as a normal treasury function the Group has been prudently investing in quality short-term bonds which are intended to be held to maturity, and full principal protected structured deposits and notes with reputable banks and financial institutions as counter-parties. As at 31 December 2010, investment in these bonds, structured deposits and notes amounted to HK$308 million. Should this amount be taken into account, the consolidated net borrowing of the Group would be reduced to HK$1,623 million.
Equity Attributable to Shareholders, based on professional valuation of the Group s investment properties as of 31 December 2010 and the depreciated costs of the Group s hotel properties, amounted to HK$28,764 million as of 31 December 2010. The net assets value at 31 December 2010 represents an increase of HK$6,447 million compared to the value of HK$22,317 million as of 31 December 2009, mainly attributable to the profit for the year, and the equity account for the Group s investment in Champion REIT units with effect from 23 July 2010. Based on the consolidated net debt of HK$1,931 million, the resulting gearing ratio at 31 December 2010 was 7%. Should the investment in bonds, structured deposits and notes mentioned above be recognized in the calculation, the gearing ratio will be reduced to 6%.

During the year, market interest rate has remained at an extremely low level. Coupled with the high interest income from the Group s investment in Champion REIT convertible bonds, the Group has earned a net interest income of HK$52 million for the year. Consequently, there is no applicable interest cover ratio as at the balance sheet dates.
Liquidity and Debt Maturity Profile As of 31 December 2010, our cash, bank deposits and committed but undrawn loan facilities amounted to a total of HK$3,197 million. The majority of our loan facilities is short or medium term in nature and is secured by properties with sufficient value to loan coverage. The following is a profile of the maturity of our outstanding debts as of 31 December 2010: Within 1 year 22.9% 1-2 years 73.5% 3-5 years 3.6% Pledge of Assets At 31 December 2010, properties of the Group with a total carrying value of approximately HK$9,615 million (31 December 2009: HK$9,895 million), were mortgaged or pledged to secure credit facilities granted to its subsidiaries.
Commitments and Contingent Liabilities As at 31 December 2010, the Group has authorised capital expenditures not provided for in these financial statements amounting to approximately HK$74 million (31 December 2009: HK$309 million) of which approximately HK$70 million (31 December 2009: HK$309 million) was contracted for.
As at 31 December 2010, the Group has outstanding financial commitment of RMB180 million (equivalent to HK$211 million) for capital injection to a jointly controlled entity, and commitment of RMB233 million (equivalent to HK$275 million) for construction cost to complete a hotel property owned by an associate.
In addition to the above, as at 31 December 2010 the Group has provided a several corporate guarantee and a charge over its interest in the share capital of an associate to a bank in respect of its share, i.e US$19.5 million of total banking facility of US$117 million granted to an associate.
Other than set out above, the Group did not have any significant commitments and contingent liabilities as at 31 
In 2011, our businesses should benefit from the generally positive outlook of the economies in Hong Kong and China.
Up to now, arrivals of affluent Chinese travellers from the Mainland have shown no signs of slowing down. Corporate travel will also be supported by robust economic activities in the region. Our Hong Kong hotels should perform well under these circumstances. However as all three hotels are already operating at or near their peak occupancy levels, the driver for RevPAR growth in 2011 will have to come mainly from further increases in room rates.
After completion of its overhaul in 2010, The Langham London has successfully repositioned itself among the leading luxury hotels in Central London. In a stable economic environment, there should be room for further gains in its occupancy and room rates in the coming year.
The outlook for our hotels in Australia and New Zealand should also be stable in view of the favourable economic situations over there. For our hotels in the United States, while we anticipate the demand for rooms may be constrained by the relatively slow pace of economic recovery, there should be some modest improvement in their performance in 2011. Capital constraints of the last several years will lead to lower completions of new hotels in the United States. This could provide the platform for more meaningful RevPAR growth for our U.S. hotel in the following 
The trend of increasing occupancy and escalating rent rates in the Central office market will be favourable to Champion REIT in the coming year. Citibank Plaza, its biggest asset, is located in Central where no large Grade-A office developments are scheduled for completion. While the property carried a 18.5% vacancy at the beginning of 2011, more than half of the existing vacant area will see tenant occupation before mid 2011, based on contracts already signed. Together with the steady income contribution from Langham Place Office Tower and Langham Place Mall, revenue for the Champion REIT s will likely show an improvement over 2010. However, distributions of Champion REIT will depend on a number of factors, including the level of interest expense upon refinancing of the debt on the Citibank Plaza property in May 2011.
Thus far, the growth in the local economy has been robust.
However, the growth has been in part driven by the vast amount of liquidity in the system, and in part by the exceptional growth in Mainland tourist arrivals. Hong Kong s economy is now inextricably tied to the state of the China economy. Under the threat of rising inflation, the Central Government will introduce more control measures, including the gradual raising of RMB interest rates. Any subsequent cool down in the China economy could negatively affect the prospects of Hong Kong. We are mindful of these risks and their potential impact on our businesses in the region.
With regard to new investments, development opportunities in Mainland China remain high on our agenda, especially mixed-use development projects that generally generate higher financial returns. Economic growth in Mainland China is amongst the fastest in the world, where increasing urbanization and rising incomes will support property price growth in the long term. That should offer a favourable risk return profile for the Group. While we will be capitalizing on volatility in the marketplace to capture opportunities for new investments on a highly selective basis, we will continue to manage our finances prudently to ensure a manageable level of debts and a high level of liquidity.
