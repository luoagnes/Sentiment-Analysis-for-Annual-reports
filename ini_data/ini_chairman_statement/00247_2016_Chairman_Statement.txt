REVIEW OF OPERATIONS 
(6) China Business China achieved GDP growth of 6.7% for the first two quarters in 2016 despite a challenging economic environment both domestically and internationally. As China s economy go through a period of rebalancing, shifting from the old drivers of growth to better reforms and economic policy adjustments in areas including household registration system, industrialisation, social welfare, national health services, education and environmental protection. These changes combined will provide greater stability leading to a more sustainable economy.
The property market in China has seen improvements as reflected in the increase in home sales value and volume as well as decreases in inventory levels during the financial year 20152016 mainly due to Central Government s accommodative housing policies in most cities. The lowering of the home mortgage interest rates and increase in the loan-to- value ratio and availability of credit to home purchasers are all favourable to increase the demand for housing.
Sino Land has three projects in China mainly for residential development with a total of approximately 16.0 million square feet of attributable plot ratio area. These projects are The Palazzo in Chengdu, Dynasty Park in Zhangzhou and Mayfair By The Lake in Xiamen.

PROSPECTS With key economic indicators showing a gradual recovery in the US and a more positive outlook of the economy, the Federal Open Market Committee in the US approved a quarter-point increase in its target federal funds rate in December 2015 after more than 7 years of accommodative monetary policy.
The increase in federal funds rate was well anticipated by the markets and it has sent a positive signal to the market on the future state of the US economy.
In the Euro zone, the European Central Bank increased the size and scope of its quantitative easing ( QE ) programme as well as extending the period of the QE to March 2017. On 23rd June, 2016, Britain voted in a referendum to exit the European Union, generally known as Brexit, casting uncertainty over issues such as trade between Britain and the rest of Europe, London s status as a world financial capital and the reaction of global financial markets to Brexit. Until the process of Brexit is completed, markets are likely to remain volatile creating more doubt over the recovery of the global economy.
In China, the Central Government adopted the Proposal on Formulating the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan on National Economic and Social Development (the Plan ) in the 5th Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee.
The Plan focuses on maintaining economic growth and social stability while continuing reform efforts. In terms of economic growth, the Plan aims to double GDP and per-capita income by 2020 from the country s base in 2010 with domestic consumption, innovation and technology advancement being the key drivers of growth. In respect of welfare, the Plan contains a variety of measures focused on poverty alleviation and extends coverage of urban welfare services to all residents. On the financial sector side, the continuing efforts to liberalise financial services and the internationalisation of Renminbi will strengthen the position of the currency in the global financial markets.
On the whole, the Plan targets to establish a better future for the people in 
The Central Government s Belt and Road initiative aims to connect major Asian and European economies through international cooperation, infrastructure developments, trade and investments.

In January 2016, Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank commenced operations and together with other supranational financial institutions such as Asian Development Bank and the World Bank, loans have been granted by these banks to finance the infrastructure development of the countries along the Belt and Road. Hong Kong has a role to play in the Belt and Road and can cooperate with other core regions of the Belt and Road to capitalise on 
The Hong Kong property market continues to consolidate as a result of economic and property-related policies. Both sales volume and value showed a decrease during the financial year 20152016 when compared to a year ago. The housing policy in the Policy Address announced on 13th January, 2016 states that there will be a consistent supply of land in Hong Kong. The HKSAR Government s effort in zoning or rezoning of sites, introducing new development areas and extending new towns should offer a solution to the long-term supply of both residential and commercial property developments.
Management will continue to optimise earnings, enhance efficiency and productivity and improve the quality of products and services. In respect of property development and property management, Sino Land will incorporate more environmentally friendly elements in our projects. Sino Land will maintain a policy of selectively and continuously replenishing its land bank, which will enable it to strengthen earnings and shareholders value. Sino Land s recurrent businesses, which comprise property leasing, hospitality and property management services, continue to contribute stable stream of income. With a good financial position, Sino Land is well-positioned to respond to challenges ahead.
STAFF AND MANAGEMENT On behalf of the Board, I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation to all staff for their commitment, dedication and continuing support. I would also like to express my gratitude to my fellow Directors for their guidance and wise counsel.
