CHAIRMAN S STATEMENT 
To the Shareholders, I am pleased to share with you the performance in the areas of print media, mobile new media and television and film operations of ChinaVision Media Group Limited (the Group ) in 2011, as well as the Group s overall business and future development plans.
In recent years, the People s Republic of China (the PRC ) economy has continued to expand while the Central Government has highlighted the importance of enriching material and spiritual life simultaneously .
According to the planning in the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventeenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Outline of Cultural Reform and Development under the Twelfth Five-year Plan has further suggested that the cultural industry should gradually develop into a pillar of the PRC economy by 2015. It is expected that favorable policies to facilitate such development are to be launched soon. With this background, the PRC cultural, film and television industry faces bright prospects.
During the year, the Group implemented certain major changes with the aim to improve and enhance its core operations, and on the other hand, expand its scale of business through acquisitions and strengthen the competitiveness of its sales network. With the synergies created within the Group s various divisions, consolidation of resources and the closer cooperation between the teams of each business division, we are setting a solid foundation on which to boost the rapid growth and become the leader of the cultural industry within the PRC.
ACQUISITION OF CEMG AND STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP WITH TENCENT On 21st October, 2011, the Group announced that it has acquired the entire issued share capital of China Entertainment Media Group Limited ( CEMG ). CEMG is a fast-growing media entertainment company principally engaged in three major business segments namely movies, television drama series and television advertising. For its movie business, CEMG works with a team of well-recognised directors, screenwriters, actors and actresses to originate four to six movies per year which include the strategic cooperation with China Film Group Corporation ( CFGC ) to co-produce and co-invest in certain Chinese history-themed mega productions. For its television drama series business, CEMG aims to invest in or produce four to six medium- to large-scale television drama series per year. CEMG also has a management team that is experienced in satellite television content and production. It has entered into a long-term cooperation agreement with the Gansu Provincial Film and TV Broadcast Group to exclusively operate the television advertising and content programming segments of the Gansu Satellite Television Network and Gansu Local Television Network. A significant milestone for the Group, the acquisition was approved unanimously by independent shareholders at the Special General Meeting held on 26th January, 2012 and was completed on 31st January, 2012.
We believe that the acquisition of CEMG helps reinforce and enhance the Group s core competitive strengths.
It also helps the Group to further enrich its portfolio of television, movies and media content, as well as content delivery platform, enabling the Group to seize numerous business opportunities in the PRC driven by favorable policies, and to further improve operational efficiency through the potential synergies created among two groups. CEMG has extensive experience in the production and distribution of film and television drama series, while the Group has competitive advantages in print media and mobile new media. More importantly, the Group is now able to tap CEMG s television network platform. Following the Acquisition, both the Group and CEMG will thus be able to utilise each other s content delivery platforms for synergistic benefits such as opportunities for cross-channel sales among different delivery platforms. In addition, the operating efficiency of the enlarged group can be further improved through sharing of resources and expenses (such as the marketing and promotion expenses, etc.). As cinema networks continue to expand and new theatres are built, we expect the PRC s box office revenues will continue to grow rapidly and demand for quality movies will 
ACQUISITION OF CEMG AND STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP WITH TENCENT 
At the same time, the Group also entered into a subscription agreement and a framework strategic cooperation agreement with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tencent Holdings Limited ( Tencent ; SEHK: 0700).
This initiative not only strengthens the strategic collaboration between the two parties, but has also enhanced the Group s capital foundation. Tencent is a leading provider of integrated Internet services with the largest base of Internet users in the PRC. We believe that such strategic partnership with Tencent will enable the Group to access various new media platforms, promote the Group s films, television drama series and artists, as well as expand the Group s new media business. We hope to promote and market our movies, television drama series, artists, new media content and mobile entertainment content on Tencent s plentiful online platform, including Instant Messaging QQ, web portal QQ.com and Qzone etc. We will also distribute and broadcast our films and television drama series via Tencent s online video platform and by co-production of premium video contents.
PRINT MEDIA BUSINESS NEWSPAPER Beijing Times celebrated the 10th anniversary of its founding in 2011. In the highly competitive media environment within Beijing, Beijing Times is one of the most popular newspapers in the city. It has also grown from a single newspaper business to a diversified media group covering Jinghua Books (NWf), Jinghua Artistic Services (No), Jinghua TV (N;), Jinghua Advertising (NJT), Jinghua Logistics (N irAm), the Jinghua website, e-business services (Q[}), and various electronic terminal products under the brand of Jinghua. For the year ended 31st December, 2011, the market shares of Beijing Times reached 73% 1 , far higher than other daily newspapers in Beijing. Leveraging its extensive readership and strong brand, the newspaper should continue to bring stable income for the Group.
With the rising living standards of the urban population in recent years, branding becomes more important in first-tier cities like Beijing, which makes print media a key platform for promotion and marketing for brand and image advertising. As such, Beijing Times set up a stylish business division in early 2011 in order to capture market opportunities for expanding its share in the advertising market for high-end products. However, pressurized by the automobile purchase restriction policy, revenues from automotive and classified advertising were affected. The rising paper cost also posed pressure on the Group s operating cost. Nevertheless, a strong rebound in commercial and classified advertising was resulted from the Group s timely adjusted business strategies according to the actual market situation. Coupled with the increasing placement of brand and image advertisements, Beijing Times remained its leading position in certain sectors of the advertising market.
The Group s print newspaper business recorded outstanding performance during the year, due to strong growth of advertisements placement especially by financial sector and high-end consumer brands. This growth momentum is expected to continue in 2012 and the management expects that the newspaper segment will grow steadily in 2012.

PRINT MEDIA BUSINESS NEWSPAPER (Continued) Capitalising on the platform of news presentation and the branding effect of Beijing Times, JinHua Website has built a trendy new interface, and launched a couple of new features including JinHua Weibo, an e-newspaper and a mobile reading solution device. JinHua Weibo s introduction in March 2011 made Beijing Times the first print media to own a Weibo platform marking a major step in its development.
Looking ahead in 2012, Beijing Times is striving to boost its brand advertising business, making this business as one of the major contributors to the Group s overall advertising income. In addition, it will also consolidate its media resources and set up a brand strategic centre in order to create additional synergistic values through better utilisation of resources. On the other hand, we are also committed to creating new profit growth driver through dedicated development of the Group s publication and logistics related businesses.
PRINT MEDIA BUSINESS MAGAZINE The Group and Groupe Le Figaro (RW) of France have strategically collaborated to jointly operate a semimonthly high-end women s magazine R FIGARO, which was launched in mid-August 2011. Madame FIGARO is currently the women s magazine with the largest circulation in France. The magazine has nine international editions and the Chinese version is called R FIGARO. Serving as an important part of the Group s strategy while opening a new era in the PRC with trendy and wide-ranging media, R FIGARO has incorporated an all-round media resource platform. The Group is developing the FIGARO iPad digital edition, as well as an official website and Weibo. R FIGARO also maintains a close strategic cooperation with the Group s mobile TV and newspaper businesses, and other media including satellite TVs. This initiative has gained wide market acceptance from advertisers representing major international brands. In addition, the magazine has already participated in two international films production.
As the Group invested substantial resources in the sales and marketing of R FIGARO in the beginning stage, the magazine recorded a loss at its inception. However, for the year 2011, R FIGARO has already covered Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and 42 second to third-tier cities. In only four-month time, our magazine has been widely recognized by the readers and the industry. The magazine even ranked the top in various fashion periodical sales rating and received positive comments from some special channels such as in Beijing and Shanghai international airports. With the continued strong development of the Chinese economy, as well as surging consumption power, the prospect of the commercial advertising business of the fashionable biweeklies R FIGARO is promising thanks to its high-end positioning and fascinating content.
MOBILE NEW MEDIA BUSINESS With the extensive roll-out of the 3G network in the PRC, it is predicted within the industry that the number of 3G users will experience accelerated growth in the coming two years. The Group is thus very bullish on the prospects of the emerging mobile internet segment. It has been exploring development opportunities and has revised its development plan for mobile new media business during the year under review. For the year ended 31st December, 2011, the revenue derived from mobile new media business increased by 44%, and the number of users surged to 23 million.

MOBILE NEW MEDIA BUSINESS (Continued) The key columns of the Group s mobile new media business cover news stories, live or recorded broadcasting of English Premier League ( EPL ) matches, social and legal system, entertainment, film and television, as well as a wide variety of self-branded columns. In 2011, the Group recorded gross sales revenue of over HK$37 million from the mobile television launched through the three largest telecom operators. At the same time, the Group was granted rights for launching two movies online, namely Feng Ju Ye Feng Kwang (@_N vr) and War of Desire (QW0) respectively. In the end of 2011, the Group was allocated with more marketing resources after having obtained the right from China Mobile Ltd for operating its vertical column of Legal System (l6R). Starting from April 2011, two of the Group s vertical columns, namely television dramas and lifestyle , were officially launched at China United Communications Group Company Limited ( China Unicom ). In the second half of 2011, revenue generated from the Group s mobile television business on the platform of China Unicom had already grown substantially.
On the other hand, various mobile businesses of the Group such as mobile digital reading, mobile music and mobile animation experienced prospective development. The Group has formatted its mobile reading, mobile games, mobile animation and mobile music businesses into its digital base. While the Group launched its mobile reading business online in 2011, it successfully introduced Feng Ju Ye Feng Kwang (@_N vr) and Love ah Ah I am Willing (aJUT@TbXa) e-books during the year under review. The Group s revenue generated from SMS service related business declined as compared with the Group s revenue in 2010 because SMS service charge was suspended since March 2011 due to the policy adjustment by the telecommunication operators, such SMS service charge resumed in December 2011 though. The Group is optimistic about the business prospects of mobile SMS, mobile reading, mobile music and mobile animation in 2012.
In addition, mobile games are also an important segment of the Group s mobile new media business.
Following the launch of sX OL , a multiplayer online role-playing game, the Group has launched fH_ X and 5 in July and August 2011 and the games were well received by users. Meanwhile, the Group is developing value added features of a new mobile game Twin Castle 2. Currently, the Group is working hard to enrich the content and improve the quality of its mobile games.
We strongly believe that content influence and channel value are the fundamentals to support all forms of media despite the changes and development of the media. Looking ahead, the Group is continuing its efforts to strengthen the partnership with telecommunications operators to jointly develop the mobile TV, mobile game, mobile reading and mobile value-added services, aiming to maintain rapid growth in these businesses in 
TELEVISION AND FILM BUSINESS The Group has been bolstering the quality of its television and film business during the year and continued to build a strong brand leveraging CEMG s solid foundation. In 2012, the Group plans to launch iyPGY , a major television drama about the weapons industry in the PRC which is currently under post-production.
While negotiating with a number of satellite TVs, iyPGY is expected to obtain high ratings and brings the Group with significant sales revenue. On the other hand, after the merger between the Group and CEMG, the enlarged group will broadcast two major dramas, namely ck!que of Heroic Trilogy (!que|R) and Liang Jian Tie Xue Jun Hun (NR 5@B) in 2012. ck!que of Heroic Trilogy (!que|R) has already completed shooting and achieved satisfactory sales and distribution results with higher profit margin expected comparing to the previous series. Liang Jian Tie Xue Jun Hun (NR 5@B) started broadcast on Zhejiang TV satellite channels since end of 2011 and recorded the highest program viewing rate since then.
It is also broadcasted on a couple of online platforms with numbers of click-rate exceeded 200 million within one week. The management is confident that this television series will contribute a significant amount of revenue to the Group in 2012.
As for our film business, leverage our successful track record and with an aim to developing high-quality movies, the Group will partner with CFGC and other investors to co-invest and co-produce a couple of high quality films in 2012, these movies are expected to be launched by end of 2012 the earliest. Looking ahead, the Group will continue to explore potentially yield-accretive investment opportunities of television drama or film production. As the television and film business always enjoys very handsome returns on investment, the Group is guided by the motto of Building a Strong Brand; Producing Outstanding Dramas in the coming year to generate more satisfactory income and profit.
OTHER VIDEO OPERATION BUSINESS Follow by the completion of the Group s subscription of the subscribed preferred shares allotted and issued by Super Sports Media Inc. ( Super Sports ), which represented 30% of the equity interest of Super Sports on an as-converted and fully diluted basis, at a total consideration of US$15 million (approximately HK$116,726,000) at the end of March 2011, Super Sports became the Group s associated company. Super Sports is a leading sports television programs company which has signed a series of license agreements with The Football Association Premier League Limited for the audio-visual exploitation of the live and recorded broadcasting, as well as other relevant exploration techniques in respect of each EPL match for the seasons between 2010 and 2013 in the territory of Mainland China and Macau.
In order to streamline the Group s operations and enhance its cash-flow position, the Group decided to sell its 30% shares in Super Sports as well as the rights of mobile live, delayed and recorded broadcasting of EPL matches to an independent third party at a consideration of US$20 million on 29th March, 2012 so as to allocate more resources to other new media business as well as film and television business. Upon the completion of the disposal of interest, the Group is still keeping the operating right of mobile broadcasting of EPL match, though not exclusively. However, by integrating the resources with the Group s other new media business and minimising the resources invested in the operation and maintenance of broadcasting EPL matches, the Group can achieve better cost-control and higher cost-efficiency in order to create greater synergies among different business segments. The Group is striving to build a resources integrated and highly efficient platform. We expect the Group s income stream and advertising revenues can be further expanded through the enhanced promotion and marketing of its new media business.

The Group has optimally utilised and reasonably invested its resources in developing its strategic businesses during the year under review. With the careful planning and excellent execution capabilities of the management, as well as the unfailing efforts of the staff, the Group s business scale has continued to grow, forming a solid foundation for us to realise the goal of becoming one of the leading diversified and integrated culture and media companies within the PRC. Looking ahead to 2012, we believe the merger with CEMG will help boosting the Group s core competitive advantages, creating greater synergies and thus achieving significant growth in terms of both revenues and profitability. At the same time, the Group will consolidate the three major businesses of traditional print media, television and film and mobile new media through organic growth and exploring cooperation and investment opportunities. It will also accelerate the development of those business segments with high growth potential and high return on investment through integration of internal resources and realising greater economies of scale.

For the year ended 31st December, 2011, the Group recorded a turnover of HK$285,265,000 and a net loss attributable to the owners of the Company of HK$212,673,000, as compared to a turnover and a net profit of HK$405,986,000 and HK$13,662,000 respectively in 2010. Excluding the non-cash expenses, including amortisation and impairment of intangible assets and film rights, the effective interest expense on convertible notes, an unrealised loss on change in fair value of investments held for trading and share options expense of HK$127,399,000 (2010: HK$149,841,000), the net loss attributable to the owners of the Company is HK$85,274,000 (2010: profit of HK$163,503,000).
The loss of HK$212,673,000 in the current year was primarily attributable to (i) increase in certain non-cash expenses, including amortisation and impairment of intangible assets and film rights, the effective interest expense on convertible notes and an unrealised loss on change in fair value of investments held for trading, which arise as a result of accounting treatment under the provisions of the applicable accounting standards; (ii) significant increase in the incidental expenses incurred for the acquisition of media related businesses of approximately HK$34,615,000; and (iii) decrease in the turnover and the gross profit of the Group due to the protracted production and delay in distribution of certain television drama series.
Loss per share (both basic and diluted) of the Group for the year ended 31st December, 2011 is 10.51 HK cents (2010: earnings per share was 0.78 HK cents) and the net assets value attributable to owners of the Company per share is HK$0.30 (2010: HK$0.38).

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Review of Operations During the year ended 31st December, 2011, the Group was primarily engaged in two businesses, namely (i) media related businesses; and (ii) securities trading and investments. Media related businesses mainly include the planning, production, publication, investment, distribution and licensing of television drama and film and organizing cultural and artistic exchange activities, mobile value-added services, mobile game business, mobile TV business, sales and distribution of newspapers and magazines, advertising agency businesses and TV programmes packaging services. A majority of these businesses were conducted in the PRC.
Media Related Businesses For the year ended 31st December, 2011, the film, television programme and television drama series production, distribution and licensing business brought the Group revenue of HK$5,934,000 (2010: HK$186,173,000) with segment loss of HK$25,891,000 (2010: profit of HK$72,056,000). The decrease in revenue was mainly due to the protracted production and delay in distribution of certain television drama series and impairment of HK$14,399,000 (2010: nil) of certain film rights that were not expected to generate significant revenue in the near future.
During the year ended 31st December, 2011, the mobile games business brought the Group revenue of HK$2,195,000 (2010: HK$1,687,000) with segment loss of HK$3,833,000 (2010: HK$5,541,000), which was mainly due to the amortisation of the mobile game intangibles acquired upon acquisition of HK$2,772,000 (2010: HK$4,211,000) and the impairment loss of an intangible asset of mobile game platform of HK$1,452,000 (2010: nil) in which no future profit was expected as a result of change in technology for 
The mobile value-added business mainly refers to the provision of personalised information and entertainment services to mobile handset users in the PRC via the internet and other modern telecom technologies in the form of SMS, MMS, WAP, interactive voice response and the like. For the year ended 31st December, 2011, this line of business brought the Group net revenues of HK$3,066,000 (2010: HK$10,416,000) with segment loss of HK$17,182,000 (2010: profit of HK$2,002,000), after netting off amortisation of licenses upon acquisition of HK$3,603,000 (2010: HK$2,266,000) and the impairment loss of the licenses of HK$4,804,000 (2010: nil) since the licenses granted by China Mobile Limited were terminated during the year and new licenses were granted in late 2011. The decrease in revenue and loss was a result of the policy adjustment by the telecommunication operators which led to suspension in the SMS value-added business since March 2011.
After a re-assessment by the telecommunication operators in August 2011, the SMS value-added business had been resumed in December 2011.
For the year ended 31st December, 2011, the net revenue of mobile TV business amounted to HK$5,172,000 (2010: HK$4,487,000) (after the 49% share of results) and this segment recorded a loss of HK$20,948,000 (2010: HK$4,240,000), which was primarily resulted from the amortisation of the broadcasting right of HK$19,061,000 (2010: HK$3,636,000).

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (Continued) Media Related Businesses (Continued) For the year ended 31st December, 2011, the newspaper advertising agency and distribution businesses contributed to the Group s revenue and segment profit of HK$237,691,000 (2010: HK$171,484,000) (after the 50% share of results) and HK$32,485,000 (2010: HK$30,579,000) respectively. The increase in revenue was primarily owing to the fact that only eight months results of this business were recognised in 2010, whereas, the drop of profit margin was caused by the rising cost of sales, in particular, paper cost.
During the second half of the year, the Group and Groupe Le Figaro (RW) of France strategically collaborated to jointly operate a high-end women s magazine R FIGARO. The first issue of R FIGARO was published in mid-August. The revenue recognised since August 2011 amounted to HK$16,971,000 and this segment recorded a loss of HK$19,400,000 which was mainly resulted from the large startup expenses and spendings over marketing and promotion.
During the year, the Group also carried out other advertising agency services. These businesses contributed to the Group s revenue and segment loss of HK$394,000 (2010: HK$19,424,000) and HK$3,283,000 (2010: profit of HK$15,518,000) respectively for the year ended 31st December, 2011.

Upon completion of the acquisition on 30th March, 2011, Super Sports became an associate of the Group. The Group shared a loss of HK$10,796,000 in Super Sports for the period since the completion of the acquisition. As the Group is determined to streamline its business operations and direct its efforts on business over which it has majority control or interests, on 29th March, 2012, the Group entered into a conditional sale and purchase agreement with an independent third party to dispose of its 30% interests in Super Sports and the English Premier League match mobile audio-visual broadcasting rights, for a total consideration of US$20,000,000.
