Chairman s Statement 
BUSINESS REVIEW AND OUTLOOK For the fiscal year of 20092010, the Group achieved a revenue of HK$11,099 million and has recorded a profit attributable to owners of the Company of HK$1,833 million.
During the year, thanks to the collective effort of our business partners and staff, the Company has quickly resumed profit growth since the financial tsunami crisis. To counter keen market competition, the Board of Directors is considering business collaboration opportunities with strategic partners so as to strengthen the company s competitiveness.
To boost production capacity, the modification of PM6 is completed as planned in June 2010. The Company will also speed up installation of PM15, with an annual production capacity of 500,000 tons, and expects production to commence in late 2010. Two new projects that would increase annual capacity by 650,000 tons and 300,000 tons respectively are also under planning, with the target for production to commence by March 2012. The aforesaid initiatives are expected to drive the Company s profit growth in a steady manner.
