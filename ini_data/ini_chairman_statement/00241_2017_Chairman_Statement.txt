CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Dear Shareholders,
As the healthcare flagship of Alibaba Group Holding Limited (“Alibaba Holding”, together with its subsidiaries, “Alibaba
Group”), Alibaba Health Information Technology Limited (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) have been
committed to developing Internet technology and establishing a service ecology platform to provide industry partners
with technical capabilities such as big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and Internet of Things, as well as
service capabilities such as operational, quality control and customer service capabilities.
With our mission of “making good health achievable at the fingertips” and our vision of “facilitating medicines through
big data and using the internet to change the face of healthcare, to provide fair, affordable and accessible medical
and healthcare services to 1 billion people”, the Group has worked hard to develop its pharmaceutical e-commerce,
intelligent medicine and product tracking system services businesses during the financial year ended March 31, 2017.
Compared to China’s huge pharmaceutical market, pharmaceutical e-commerce in China is still at a nascent stage of
development, with pharmaceutical e-commerce making up only approximately 3% of pharmaceutical sales in China,
which means there is still huge potential for its development. In addition, China’s retail pharmacies are currently
undergoing an upgrade and transformation through chain operation, e-commerce, supply chain optimization and greater
service specialization.
The Group aspires to create an Internet-based drug distribution and sales system that covers the entire industry chain,
thereby enhancing the efficiency of the healthcare product supply chain and bringing benefits to all market participants
and consumers. It commenced its own pharmaceutical e-commerce business this year, and leveraging on its operational
branding strengths and owing to the efficient execution of its business team, the Group quickly established the
supporting systems for warehousing, logistics and customer services. This has facilitated the rapid growth of its
pharmaceutical e-commerce business. The Group also commenced the provision of merchants’ business development,
merchant customer services, technical support and other outsourced and value-added services for certain
pharmaceutical-related categories on the Tmall platform in consideration for relevant service fees received from Tmall.
In addition, the Group began to develop centralized procurement and distribution operations for the pharmaceutical
supply chain, starting by analyzing circulation data at the supply chain upstream to better provide quality products at
competitive prices to downstream businesses. At the same time, the Group also rolled out a new online and offline
integrated retail channel covering the full chain by combining B2C and O2O businesses.
In relation to intelligent medicine, the Group actively organized the provision of online health consultation services by
pharmaceutical professionals through end-user applications such as the Ali Health mobile application, and the Taobao,
Tmall and Alipay mobile applications, allowing users to easily obtain real-time professional guidance. The Group has
also actively established a personal health management platform through which personal health reports are compiled
using smart devices and artificial intelligence engines, and personalized health management services can be provided
to users.
The PRC government has implemented a number of healthcare reform initiatives to encourage tiered medical
consultation and treatment and doctors to practise at multiple locations. The Group will continue to actively explore
the construction of an Internet-based tiered medical service network through the Internet hospital model, to facilitate
optimization of medical resource allocation by medical institutions. Furthermore, the Group has invested significant
manpower and other resources towards the integration of online and offline medical data, and is cooperating with
quality hospitals and experts in the medical sector to develop artificial intelligence medical analysis engines and to
actively explore technology extension and product forms for intelligent medicine, with the aim of helping medical
institutions to enhance their efficiency in terms of technological research, operation and diagnosis. Meanwhile, the
Group is also exploring investment opportunities in these areas. The Group, together with those who share our vision,
will explore the creation of personalized electronic health records for the public through the application of Internet
technology and artificial intelligence, to promote integrated healthcare services covering prevention, treatment,
rehabilitation and health management throughout the full life cycle.
In relation to the construction of our product tracking system, in addition to our continued operation of the product
identification, authentication and tracking system for the drug industry (“Drug PIATS”) under the policy guidance of the
China Food and Drug Administration, the Group has leveraged on its prior accumulated technical and operational
experience and launched its Ma Shang Fang Xin (碼上放心) tracking platform, which offers product tracking and related
value-added services to help manufacturers properly establish product tracking systems and realize quality assurance
and marketing control, and to provide consumers with a terminal tool for scanning codes to trace product origin. As
at the end of the year ended March 31, 2017, more than 5,000 enterprises from the drug, food and nutritional
supplement industries had signed up with the Group to join its Ma Shang Fang Xin platform, among which the number
of pharmaceutical manufacturers which signed up accounted for more than half of the total number of pharmaceutical
manufacturers in China.
With strong support from Alibaba Group and our ongoing investment in the expansion of strategic businesses and in
nurturing talent, we believe that the Group is well-positioned to satisfy the considerable demand in China’s healthcare
market and that our business will maintain strong growth in the next few years. Finally, I would like to take this
opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to our shareholders, business partners, product users, and all of our staff
for their long and unwavering support.
