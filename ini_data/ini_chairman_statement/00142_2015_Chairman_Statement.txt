Chairman s Letter 
In 2014, the global economy expanded at a slower pace than hoped. While the United States and the United Kingdom gained momentum, growth in other developed countries, slowed. As well, the rate of growth slowed amongst developing countries.
Indonesia grew at around 5% rate, its slowest rate in the past five years. In an unusual contrast, Indonesia s growth was outdone by the usually slower-growing Philippines where the economy grew by around 6%.
In markets where 5% growth is considered slow, there can be had strong returns. This is why investors come to First Pacific, and this is why a solid proportion of our owners are long-term shareholders. Our asset value has soared ahead at a compound annual growth rate of 20% over the past 12 years and I see no reason not to expect continuing strong growth going forward.
Our commitment to shareholder value remains firm.
We remain confident in our outlook for continuing strong growth in our markets. We are focused on investing only in businesses we understand and feel optimistic about, namely telecommunications, foodconsumer, infrastructure and natural resources. We prefer to invest in companies that can deliver cash to shareholders. We prefer to invest in big companies, so that the turnaround we engineer in cash flows can scale up to meaningful levels. And we insist on significant influence or management control of our investee companies, so that we can feel more confident about their strategic direction and 
As the year 2015 progresses, we can look forward with increasing optimism about the future. New investments will contribute to earnings even as our more mature assets steadily deliver the strong cash flows we have come to expect over the years. Looking ahead, I remain proudly confident about the prospects of the First Pacific Group.
