Chairman’s Statement
To Our Shareholders,
Nowhere are the benefits of closer
economic ties more pronounced than in
Mainland China and Hong Kong. The two
places have their own advantages. One has
the manpower, natural resources and
manufacturing might, while the other has
the management skills and marketing
know-how. Increasing economic links
between the two places, as evidenced in
the growing flows of people, goods and
information across the border, have
benefited both economies enormously in
recent years.
Over the years, Hong Kong has been
confronted with various challenges. On
every occasion, we were able to rely on our
unique qualities — resourcefulness,
perseverance, diligence and passion for
excellence — to rise above our difficulties.
After a protracted period of economic
slowdown, our economy has regained its
growth momentum, thanks to our people’s
hard work and supportive government
policies. The rising interest rate, high oil
prices and the recent trade disputes cast a
shadow over the Hong Kong economy.
However, the flexibility of Hong Kong
businessmen should soon twist a way to
success again.
Hong Kong economy that places greater
emphasis on tourism will bring direct
benefit to the Group’s tourism-linked
businesses, such as shopping malls and
hotels. With the support of the Central
Government, policies like CEPA and
Individual Visit Scheme are going full
stream ahead, giving much needed stimulus
to our trade, professional service and retail
sectors in particular and our economy in
general, and setting a positive tone for the
Group’s business development going
forward.
With its well-established business network
in both Mainland China and Hong Kong,
the Group will be able to capture
opportunities arising from the growth and
integration of the two economies, and scale
new heights in the years ahead.
