Chairman's Statement
Responsibilities
During 2001, CLP has
celebrated its centenary—
China Light & Power
Company, Limited, the
forerunner of today's CLP,
was established in Hong
Kong in 1901.
Our centenary has been an
opportunity to recognise the
support that the Company enjoys
from our entire community, as well
as a reminder of the importance to
the long-term viability of our
business, of the effective
management of our relationships
with all our stakeholders .
In this year's Annual Report, we
have sought to explain how the
Company is meeting its corporate
responsibilities to our
shareholders, customers,
employees, business partners and
the wider community.
SHAREHOLDERS
The shareholders own the
Company—they have made a
choice to invest their money in the
Company's shares. We have an
obligation to justify the trust that
they have placed in us.
I am, therefore, pleased to report
that for the year ended 31 December
2001, earnings per share for the
recurring operations were HK$2.33,
an increase of 2.6% compared to the
previous year. The Scheme of Control
earnings for the year ended 31
December 2001 grew by 5.3% to
HK$5,422 million, as a result of CLP
Power's ongoing investment in its
transmission and distribution
network. Interest income decreased
from HK$93 million to HK$28 million
due to cash on hand being applied to
investments. Earnings from other
non-Scheme of Control activities
decreased from HK$426 million to
HK$339 million, reflecting the start-
up costs of power projects outside
Hong Kong, telecommunications and
other businesses.
Total earnings for 2001 were
HK$7,257 million, compared to
HK$5,768 million for the year
ended 31 December 2000. These
took into account the Group's share
of profit of HK$1,468 million
arising from the Hok Un
redevelopment. Including these
redevelopment profits, earnings
per share were HK$2.92, an
increase of 26.4%.
In April 2001, a special centenary
dividend of HK$0.27 per share was
paid and the Company also made a
bonus issue of one new share of
HK$5.00 credited as fully paid for
every five shares held.
In respect of 2001, the Board has
recommended a final dividend of
HK$0.44 per share, and a special
final dividend out of the Hok Un
profit of HK$0.61 per share. These,
together with the three interim
dividends paid during the year,
result in a total dividend of
HK$2.10 per share. The Board
anticipates that three interim
dividends will be payable in June,
September and December 2002. In
line with market practice, and as a
change from the practice
previously adopted by the
Company, the Board is not stating
the anticipated amount of those
interim dividends. However, there
will be no change to CLP's
underlying policy of providing
stable and consistent dividends to
its shareholders.
CUSTOMERS
The core of the CLP Group's
activities is our electricity business
in Hong Kong carried on by CLP
Power, which supplies electricity to
two million customers in Kowloon
and the New Territories,
representing a population of over
five million (about 80% of the total
population of Hong Kong).
Throughout our first century, CLP
has had a duty to provide our
customers with a supply of
electricity which is reliable,
adequate and at the lowest
reasonable cost. During 2001,
we have continued to discharge
that responsibility with diligence
and dedication.
In January 2001, we announced
a tariff freeze for the year.
Productivity gains and cost
savings also enabled CLP Power
to provide a HK$200 rebate for
each of our customers, as part
of our initiatives to celebrate
CLP's centenary.
In December, we announced that
we would be freezing tariffs for
2002 — the fourth successive year
in which CLP's basic tariffs will
remain unchanged. We also offered
a rebate of HK$220 and a reduction
of fuel clause charges, bringing
about an average tariff reduction of
2.2%. As a result, about one million
of our customers have enjoyed free
electricity worth one month or
more of their normal charges.
CLP Power's cost-saving initiatives
and tariff reductions have not
been achieved at the expense of
the provision of an adequate and
reliable electricity supply. In 2001,
we invested HK$4.6 billion in
modernising and upgrading our
network. Supply reliability
exceeds 99.99%, which meets
world-class standards.
EMPLOYEES
CLP relies on a highly skilled
and motivated workforce. We
have a corresponding obligation
to provide our staff with a
safe working environment, to
encourage them to develop their
full potential and to fairly reward
them for their achievements.
In line with this obligation, 2001
saw further initiatives taken to
enhance the principle of "pay
for performance", including the
implementation of a revised
remuneration strategy which
has been introduced in phases
within the CLP Group. The shared
commitment of CLP and its staff
to continuous learning and skills
enhancement was demonstrated
by over 31,000 man-days
being spent on training and
people development.
In a time of economic challenge
and uncertainty, the productivity
i mprovements made in recent
years, including a phased
reduction in CLP's workforce
from 6,640 in 1993 to 4,085 in
2001, have enabled us to avoid
both salary cuts and forced
redundancies during the
past year.
The Board and Management are
determined that CLP must be a safe
place to work. We are committed to
promoting the highest safety
standards at all times.
BUSINESS PARTNERS
We have a responsibility to be
straightforward, honest and
trustworthy in all our business
dealings and partnerships. High
standards of business ethics,
transparency and integrity are
fundamentals of our business. CLP's
standards are set out in a Code of
Conduct which applies to all
directors and employees of the
Company and its subsidiaries,
whatever their responsibilities and
wherever they work. The Code is also
published on our website, so that all
those who deal with CLP are aware
of our standards and ethics.
CLP's reputation for honesty and
integrity has helped us to establish a
network of relationships throughout
the Asia-Pacific region, such as with
Electricity Generating Public
Company Limited in Thailand, YTL
Group in Malaysia, the Tata Group in
India and Taiwan Cement
Corporation in Taiwan. We
particularly value the long-standing
partnership with Exxon Mobil
Corporation, with whom we have
jointly participated in the generation
of electricity for supply to CLP Power
since 1964.
In the Chinese mainland, we have
established joint ventures with
industry leaders such as the
Beijing Guohua Group, Shandong
Electric Power Group and
Guangdong Nuclear Investment.
CLP's excellent reputation in the
Mainland was confirmed during
my meeting in November with
President Jiang Zemin. President
Jiang recognised CLP's investment
efforts in the Mainland and
urged CLP to continue to make
use of its strengths and to
increase its investment in China's
western regions.
COMMUNITY
Wherever we conduct our
business, we respect and support
the interests of the community.
A prime responsibility in this
regard is to safeguard the
environment everywhere CLP
operates and to ensure that our
activities today do not jeopardise
the health and well-being of
present and future generations.
In Hong Kong, CLP operates
according to a comprehensive
Environmental Management
System, consistent with recognised
international practice. In 2001, our
efforts were recognised by the
Hong Kong Awards for Industry in
Environmental Performance.
We are determined that our
environmental initiatives should
apply to all of CLP's activities, not
merely those in Hong Kong. To
further ensure that our practices
are aligned with developing global
standards, CLP joined the World
Business Council for Sustainable
Development in 2001 — the first
company in Hong Kong to do so.
Care for the environment is part of
our broader commitment to good
corporate citizenship. In 2001, we
demonstrated this by numerous
activities and initiatives across the
CLP Group, ranging from tree
planting in Hong Kong to school
projects in western China.
OUR SECOND CENTURY
Over time, a company can only
survive and prosper if it conducts
its business in a manner which is
consistent with the legitimate
interests and well-being of its
stakeholders. CLP takes seriously
its long-term responsibilities to its
shareholders and all its other
stakeholders. Their continued
support for the Company remains
essential as we embark upon our
second century.
The Hon. Michael D. Kadoorie
Hong Kong, 25 February 2002
