CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Dear Shareholders,
On behalf of the Board of directors (the “Board”) of Kingston
Financial Group Limited (the “Company”), I am pleased to present
to you the Company’s (together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”)
annual performance and business development for the year ended
31 March 2017 (the “Year”).
The Group recorded a 8% decrease in revenue from approximately
HK$3,115,050,000 for the year ended 31 March 2016 (“the
Previous Year”) to HK$2,878,897,000 for the Year. Profit
attributable to the Company’s shareholders for the Year decreased
by 13% from approximately HK$1,700,374,000 for the Previous
Year to approximately HK$1,484,943,000. It was mainly attributed
to the decrease in income from securities brokerage, underwriting
and placements business, hindered by the unstable,global
financial environment which caused a strong pressure to the Hong
Kong capital market and led to a 34% decrease in the average
daily turnover of the Hong Kong securities market during the Year.
The Group has navigated the challenging financial atmosphere in
Hong Kong and weathered the inevitable fluctuations in the market
underpinned by its strong capital base, prudent risk control and
team of professionals. The Group achieved satisfactory results in
the industry with total revenue generated from the financial service
business segment of approximately HK$2,206,109,000 for the year
ended 31 March 2017, representing a decrease of 10% as
compared with HK$2,443,448,000 in the Previous Year.
Encouragingly, stepping into 2017, businesses and financial
markets began to respond more optimistically to the political and
financial events around the globe, and there are also signs of
recovery among advanced and developing economies. At a
regional level, the Group is looking forward to the official
confirmation of the bond connect scheme to be introduced through
collaboration between Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the
People’s Bank of China, citing a desire to get access to
northbound and southbound trading that drive up cross border
investment activities and onshore exposure of international
enterprises. As a leading player in the Hong Kong bourse, the
Group will continue to explore proactive business engagement and
opportunities.
Macau’s gaming and tourism industry has seen a nascent recovery
since last summer. With its efforts to reinvent itself as a Hollywoodthemed
resort, Macau remains one of the world’s most popular
tourist destinations. We believe the development of tourism and
gaming business will remain stable in the long run. Supported by
the steady demand, the Group’s hotel business contributed
revenue of approximately HK$180,693,000 for the Year (the
Previous Year: HK$190,780,000), and gaming revenue amounted
to approximately HK$492,095,000 for the Year (the Previous Year:
HK$480,822,000).
Furthermore, the Group is cautiously optimistic about the tourism
outlook of Macau. The Group would also like to diversify the origins
of customers through enhanced membership programs and
marketing activities.
Lastly, I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude
to our board of directors, dedicated team of the Group
professionals for their unwavering commitment and passion for the
business over the past years. I would also like to sincerely thank all
our valued service providers and business partners as well as you
the shareholder for the continuous supports.
By Order of the Board
Chu, Nicholas Yuk-yui
Chairman
