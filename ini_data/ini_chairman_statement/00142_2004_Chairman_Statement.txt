Chairman’s Letter
Dear Shareholder:
I am pleased to report to you that
2003 was a year of substantial
progress and achievement for First
Pacific. We have made significant
strides in reducing debt and
enhancing profitability across our
businesses and as a result our 2003
attributable net profit doubled to
US$81.5 million compared with
US$40.1 million in 2002.
First Pacific’s “active management”
investment approach was the driver
behind our improved performance. At
PLDT, where Manny Pangilinan has
served as President and CEO
concurrent to his roles at First Pacific,
his management team has
accomplished a singular achievement:
proving that when strategically crafted
and smartly executed, the
convergence business model can work
in the telecommunications sector. For
2003 PLDT reported the single largest
net profit ever reported by a Philippine
corporate.
Indofood continued its substantial
market leadership in 2003 – especially
in its core noodles business – despite
the entry of new competitors for
several of its key brands. Upon the
announcement by President Director
and CEO Eva Hutapea Riyanti in
December 2003 to retire at the
upcoming AGM, an Executive
Committee was formed to manage
Indofood. I have undertaken to chair
that committee – like Manny, also in
my dual role as Chairman of First
Pacific – and intend to further
strengthen what already is among
Indonesia’s strongest companies.
Given our success at reducing debt
and the present, enhanced outlook for
our primary investments, a solid
foundation is being laid for First Pacific
to identify and capitalize upon new
growth opportunities. Our 23-year
history First Pacific is testament to just
that: surprising the market by making
intelligent investments into
undervalued assets and via our direct
and proactive management, improving
them to where significant shareholder
value can be realized.
Despite whatever skepticism may exist
I am confident that First Pacific will
continue to remain true to that
mission, and look forward to reporting
our progress in this regard to you next
year.
Cordially,
ANTHONI SALIM
Chairman
