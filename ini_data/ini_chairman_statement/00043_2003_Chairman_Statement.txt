Consolidated turnover was US$1,542.2 million (2001: US$1,449.5 million). Only the turnover of the Company and its subsidiaries is shown in the financial highlights section on page 3 thus excluding the turnover of all of our PRC jointly controlled entities and associates, which are major business entities in their own right. On the other hand, the table on page 12 which shows the Total and Attributable Turnover Under Management of the Company represents the turnover of the Group s business whether as subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities or associates. As the table illustrates, our agri-business in the PRC continues to be the dominant part of the Group s activities.

PRC CHINA AGRO AND CHINA INVESTMENT During the year under review, Chia Tai (China) Agro-Industrial Ltd. ( China Agro ) and Chia Tai (China) Investment Co., Ltd. ( China Investment ), the two wholly-owned subsidiaries which run our agri-business operations in the PRC, saw a 5.1% increase in turnover.
Turnover on a consolidated basis was US$1,415.5 million (2001: US$1,346.5 million).

Unit sales of our two main products, complete feed and day-old chicks were 4.9 million tonnes (2001: 5.5 million tonnes) and 364.0 million units (2001: 436.4 million units), decreases of 10.9% and 16.6% respectively.
The total consolidated profit attributable to shareholders of China Agro and China Investment during the year was US$96.3 million (2001: US$4.5 million).
During the year under review, the Group disposed of 187,396,528 (2001: 40,326,024) shares in Shanghai Dajiang (Group) Stock Co., Ltd. ( Shanghai Dajiang ) at an average price of US$0.57 (2001: US$0.73) per share and recorded a gain of US$87.6 million (2001: US$26.1 million).

Excluding the gain in Shanghai Dajiang shares, our operating loss was US$11.4 million (2001: 
Our operating results have been affected by a number of factors. During the second half of 2002, outbreak of the epidemic disease of swine in some areas and Northern PRC, abnormal rainfall, drought and the drastic increase in cost of major raw materials caused a reduction in the gross margin of our feed business.
For the poultry business, as the European Community has not yet released their import control over Chinese chicken meat products, Japan remains the primary export market for our chicken meat products. However, the devaluation of the Brazilian currency in 2002 has led to a large inflow of low-priced Brazilian chicken meat products into the Japanese market, resulting in a reduction of the average selling price by 20%. Our integration ventures suffered from both losses in quantity and gross margin for the exports.
Other than to continue focusing on value-added poultry meat processing products for export, the Group will explore the potential markets in Europe as well as the high value-added and branded meat processing products in the domestic market. We will also increase our attention to develop in the domestic aqua feed market.
The performance of our PRC agri-business ventures is presented on pages 15 to 18.

The performance of our Turkish operation has significantly improved and achieved a profit of US$8.0 million (2001: loss of US$3.9 million). During the year, our Turkish operation recorded an increase in sales of chicken meat both in terms of volume and unit price. Moreover, it has benefited from the relatively stable value of Turkish Lira this year when compared with the exchange loss from free float of Turkish Lira last year. As there is a tendency in tightening the control in environmental protection in Western Europe, part of the chicken meat production has recently been shifted to Eastern Europe and the Middle East, our Turkish operation is expected to benefit from this in the near future.

The Group maintains a 19.75% interest in P.T. Surya Hidup Satwa and a 7.09% interest in P.T.
