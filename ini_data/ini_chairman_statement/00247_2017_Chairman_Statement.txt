net rental income increased 4.2% to HK$3,486.0 million (2015/2016:

property portfolio under Sino Land was at approximately 97% (2015/2016:

(4) Rental Activities (Continued)

Sino Land’s investment property portfolio primarily serves the need of its
customers which include tenants, shoppers and the communities around
the properties. The design and condition of the properties together with
the quality of service provided to customers are of paramount importance.
To ensure that the properties are in good condition with the proper layout
and design, Sino Land would perform regular review of the properties. On
service quality, Sino Land places a strong emphasis on regular training
particularly for all front-line staff to ensure that the service provided to
customers meets their expectations. Comments from customers, reports by
silent shoppers and recognitions from professional institutions all play a
role in assessing the quality of service delivered by the staff.
As at 30th June, 2017, Sino Land has approximately 11.9 million square
feet of attributable floor area of investment properties and hotels in
Hong Kong, China, Singapore and Sydney. Of this portfolio, commercial

these hotels was slightly affected by soft demand and competitive business
environment during the year. Sino Land will continue to improve the
quality of its hotel services to ensure our discerning guests have enjoyable
experiences during their stays in the hotels.
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore was gazetted as Singapore’s 71st national
monument on 7th December, 2015 by the country’s National Heritage
Board. It is the highest form of recognition given to a building for its
national significance.
(6) China Business
China has achieved several important international milestones in
2016/2017 which were the inclusion of Renminbi in the International
Monetary Fund’s basket of reserve currencies; the launch of ShenzhenHong
Kong Stock Connect; and the imminent inclusion of China’s
domestic A-shares in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.
China’s economic parameters including inflation rate and job creation
were both within target. Economic policies pursued by Central
Government continued to focus on controlling capacity in production
and sustaining financial healthiness in both fiscal and monetary sectors.
On the residential property market, inventory levels have been reduced
and Central Government stepped up housing measures and monetary
tightening which are expected to suppress growth in home sales prices
and volume in the near term.
Sino Land has two projects in China mainly for residential development,
namely The Palazzo in Chengdu and Dynasty Park in Zhangzhou and a
serviced apartment project in Qianhai Bay, Shenzhen. Attributable plot
ratio area from the three projects total approximately 15.8 million square
feet.
Other than the matters mentioned above, there has been no material change
from the information published in the report and accounts for the year ended
30th June, 2016.
FINANCE As at 30th June, 2017, the Group had cash and bank deposits of
HK$33,317.2 million. After netting off total borrowings of HK$7,384.2 million,
the Group had net cash of HK$25,933.0 million as at 30th June, 2017. Of
the total borrowings, 53.9% was repayable within one year, 23.6% repayable
between one and two years and the balance repayable between two and five
years.
The majority of the Group’s debts are denominated in Hong Kong dollars
and US dollars, with the balance in Singapore dollars. The Singapore dollars
denominated debts are mainly used to fund The Fullerton Heritage project in
Singapore. Other than the above-mentioned, there was no material change
in foreign currency borrowings and the capital structure of the Group for the
financial year 2016/2017. The majority of the Group’s cash are denominated
in Hong Kong dollars, with a portion of Renminbi, Australian dollars and US
dollars. The Group has maintained a sound financial management policy and
foreign exchange exposure has been prudently kept at a minimal level.
The Group places great importance on corporate integrity, business ethics
and good governance. With the objective of practising good corporate
governance, the Group has formed Audit, Compliance, Remuneration and
Nomination Committees. The Group is committed to maintaining corporate
transparency and disseminates information about new developments through
various channels, including press releases, its corporate website, results
briefings, site visits and participation in investor conferences.
CUSTOMER SERVICE Sino Land is committed to building quality projects. In keeping with its
mission to enhance customer satisfaction, Sino Land will, wherever possible,
ensure that attractive design concepts and features are also environmentally
friendly for its developments. Management conducts regular reviews of its
properties and service so that improvements can be made on a continuous
basis.
CORPORATE SOCIAL
RESPONSIBILITY
As a committed corporate citizen, Sino Land has been actively participating
in a wide range of community programmes, voluntary services for charity
organisations and events as well as green initiatives to promote sustainability,
environmental protection, arts and culture and heritage conservation. In
recognition of Sino Land’s continuous efforts in promoting sustainability and
upholding high standards in environmental, social and corporate governance
aspects, Sino Land has been named a constituent company of the Hang
Seng Corporate Sustainability Index Series since September 2012. During
the financial year 2016/2017, Sino Land published its Sustainability Review
2016 which has been prepared with reference to Hong Kong Exchanges and
Clearing Limited’s ‘Environmental, Social and Governance Reporting Guide’
under Appendix 27 to the Main Board Listing Rules.
Sino Heritage was established in 2011 with the belief that conservation of
cultural heritage helps the community build a sense of identity and strengthen
relationships in the city. Sino Heritage identifies and showcases the heritage
significance of historical projects in both Hong Kong and Singapore. In March
2008, the Ng Teng Fong Family, the major shareholder of the Group, set up
a non-profit-making organisation, named Hong Kong Heritage Conservation
Foundation Limited (“HCF”). HCF revitalised and converted the Old Tai O
Police Station, a Grade II historic building, into a boutique hotel. Named Tai
O Heritage Hotel (“Hotel”), it is home to nine colonial-style rooms and suites,
and commenced operation in March 2012. The Hotel, operated by HCF as
a non-profit-making social enterprise, is part of the HKSAR Government’s
‘Revitalising Historic Buildings Through Partnership Scheme’. The Hotel was
a winner of the ‘2013 UNESCO Asia-Pacific Awards for Cultural Heritage
Conservation’.
Following decades of export-oriented economic growth, China has established
itself as the second largest economy and one of the key contributors in the
process of globalisation. The creation of an economic and mutually beneficial
trade route between Asia and Europe through the Belt and Road Initiative
can benefit Asia, Europe and many other nations. A successful Belt and Road
Initiative will go beyond infrastructure development and trade as it will help
reduce poverty and regional economic disparity along the Belt and Road.
China has taken the role to lead and manage the Belt and Road Initiative
since its inception in 2013, paving the way for the next stage of development.
In May 2017, the first Leaders Roundtable of the Belt and Road Forum for
International Co-operation was held in Beijing which covered integration
issues and the further development of economic partnership. Many state
leaders and over a thousand representatives attended the event indicating
wide support internationally for the Initiative. Hong Kong has a role to play
in the Belt and Road. This year, President Xi Jinping visited Hong Kong for
the first time as President of China, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the
handover of sovereignty to China by the British government. During his visit,
the President highlighted the benefits for Hong Kong to leverage its strengths
and role in advancing the Belt and Road Initiative and to cooperate with
other core regions to capitalise on this opportunity.
The concept of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area (“Greater
Bay Area”) can be traced back to 2004 when the first strategic planning study
named “Planning Study on the Coordinated Development of the Greater Pearl
River Delta Townships” was proposed and completed in 2009. There have
been much discussion and reports done since then. The development of the
Greater Bay Area is also supported by the 13th Five-Year Plan and it covers
11 cities which are Dongguan, Foshan, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Huizhou,
Jiangmen, Macau, Shenzhen, Zhaoqing, Zhongshan and Zhuhai with a total
area of over 56,000 square kilometers. The plan was also stated in the report
of the Central Government by the Premier of the State Council in the Fifth
Session of the 12th National People’s Congress of the People’s Republic
of China in March 2017. Establishing the Greater Bay Area promotes the
development of the metropolitan areas along Pearl River Delta Region and is
part of the nation-wide urban agglomeration plan designed by the National
Development and Reform Commission. Improvement in connectivity among
cities can optimise their synergies and maximise economic potential of the
cities.
Management will continue to optimise earnings, enhance efficiency and
productivity and improve the quality of products and services. In respect of
property development, Sino Land will maintain a policy of selectively and
continuously replenishing its land bank, which will enable it to strengthen
earnings and shareholders’ value. Since July 2016, Sino Land has acquired a
total of approximately 1.9 million square feet of attributable floor area for sale
and investment purposes. Sino Land’s recurrent businesses, which comprise
property leasing, hospitality and property management services, continue to
contribute stable stream of income. With a good financial position, Sino Land
is well-positioned to respond to challenges ahead.
STAFF AND MANAGEMENT On behalf of the Board, I would like to take this opportunity to express
my sincere appreciation to all staff for their commitment, dedication and
continuing support. I would also like to express my gratitude to my fellow
Directors for their guidance and wise counsel.
