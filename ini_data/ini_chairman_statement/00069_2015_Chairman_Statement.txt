On behalf of the Board, i would like to present the Annual Report of Shangri-La Asia Limited for the financial year ended 31 December 2014. While the hotel operating environment remained challenging, there were positive achievements for the Company in 2014.
Consolidated revenues grew 1.5% over the prior year to US$2.112 billion. After tax profits (but before non-operating items) attributable to Shareholders increased by 36.1% compared to 2013 to US$89.8 million due to a notable improvement in the performance of the Company s investment property portfolio. However, after tax profits (inclusive of non-operating items) fell by 53.9% to US$180.9 million in view of the reduced net unrealized revaluation gains on investment properties. A final dividend of HK6 cents per ordinary share has been proposed, which when added to the interim dividend will amount to a total dividend of HK12 cents per share for the financial year. Occupancy rates for our hotel portfolio overall nudged ahead marginally, but yields remained unchanged compared to the previous year.
The Group s results have been bolstered by our efforts to foster rental yields through our investment property portfolio. Rentals represent a recurring income and profit stream that will help sustain us through difficult periods and augment our revenues and profits.
A highlight of 2014 was the conclusion of a successful rights issue to augment the equity capital base of the Company and lower the level of debt.
it was also a year the Group unveiled the Hotel Jen brand to cater to contemporary and independent minded travelers who seek informal and efficient service together with our uncompromising high standards.
i wish to extend my heartfelt thanks to all of our staff and management for their hard work, dedication, and trust, and my fellow Directors for their continued support and guidance.
