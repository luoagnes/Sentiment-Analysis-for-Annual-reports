C HAIRMAN S S TATEMENT 
On behalf of the Board of Directors, I am pleased to present the first annual report of Kingboard Laminates Holdings Limited (the Company ) and its subsidiaries (the Group ) for the financial year ended 31 December 2006 since our successful listing on the main board of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the Stock Exchange ) on 7 December 2006.
The overwhelming market response to our initial public offering reflected market confidence in the solid business fundamentals of the Group. The success of the initial public offering laid a new milestone and granted the Group an access to the international capital markets so that we now have the financial agility to capture additional growth opportunities as they arise.

" Revenue surged 38% to exceed HK$8.4 billion " Pre-tax profit margin increased to 22% " Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company grew by 52% to HK$1,638.1 million " Return on equity attributable to equity holders of the Company advanced to 34.9% " Healthy financial position with net gearing at 24% 
On the back of positive market conditions especially at the emerging markets in 2006, demand for consumer electronics product remained robust. Being the largest laminate producer in the world, the Group was able to take full advantage of our vertically integrated business model with a competitive cost structure to continuously gain share in the global laminate market.
Our comprehensive product portfolio enabled us to further broaden our customer base and enter new markets. Sales of paper laminate, glass epoxy laminate and composite epoxy material (CEM) laminate each continued to attain respectable growth in the year.
Consolidated revenue of the Group was up 38% from fiscal year 2005 to HK$8,472.4 million. Earnings before interest and tax ( EBIT ) rose even higher by 47% to HK$1,960.3 million over previous year. Volume sales were up by around 14% with the average monthly shipment reaching 6.7 million sq. meters.
Revenue growth had outpaced volume growth because of tight supply of upstream raw materials which resulted in higher average selling price of laminate.

Coupled with better cost structure, the capacity expansion of our manufacturing facilities in Fogang, Guangdong province had contributed positively to the EBIT margin expansion. In addition, other upstream component materials businesses such as copper foil, glass yarn and glass fabric had provided a strong foundation to this sterling earning growth as the Group benefited from the stable supply of quality raw material at competitive costs along the vertically integrated supply chain.
Kingboard is the largest laminate manufacturer in the world.

The increase in distribution costs by 29% was in line with the increased shipment volume of laminates and other upstream component materials. Compared to the magnitude of the revenue growth, administrative expenses increased by only 6.3% as a result of our tight control over costs. Our effective tax rate stood at 7.7%, being similar to last year.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The financial position of the Group continued to be healthy. As at 31 December 2006, net current assets and current ratio of the Group were approximately HK$3,873.0 million (31 December 2005 HK$1,091.3 million) and 2.87 (31 December 2005 1.14)

The proportion of bank borrowings between short term and long term bank borrowings stood at 18%:82% (31 December 2005: 74%:26%). All bank borrowings were denominated in either Hong Kong or US dollars.

In 2006, the Group had invested HK$812.8 million in new production facilities in order to tap on the enormous business opportunities ahead in China and overseas markets.

After some brief softness in demand for laminates at the start of 2007 due to seasonal effect of Chinese Lunar New Year, our laminate order book has picked up since March 2007 and our plants are currently operating near full capacity. In anticipation of growing demand for more sophisticated electronics product, the Group will develop new products and continue to expand production capacity of glass epoxy laminate and upstream component materials so as to capture new business opportunities in the global market place. We aim to achieve our continuous sales growth by strengthening our relationship with brand name manufacturers and expanding our presence in overseas markets such as India and Russia.
The Group sets to expand the monthly production capacity of glass epoxy laminate by 35% in 2007. To capitalize on the cost advantages, the production facilities at Fogang, Guangdong province will expand further by 400,000 sheets monthly by end of 2007. The new glass epoxy laminate factory in Jiangyin, Jiangsu province will raise our monthly production capacity by another 600,000 sheets by end of 2007. This is in line with our strategy to enhance our market presence in eastern China where there is rapid growth in electronics industry. In addition, to support laminate capacity growth, the capacity expansion of upstream component materials including copper foil, glass yarn and glass fabric is planned in tandem in 2007. The new epoxy resin plant in Jiangyin, Jiangsu province will commence trial operation by April 2007. All this additional capacity will strengthen our cost competitiveness and enables us to capture market share in future.
