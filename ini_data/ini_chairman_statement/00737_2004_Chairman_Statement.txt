Chairman s Statement Sir Gordon Ying Sheung WU GBS, KCMG, FICE 
Iam glad to report to our shareholders that the first financial year of Hopewell Highway Infrastructure Limited ( HHI ) as a publicly listed company was a successful one. Driven by the economic growth in the region on which HHI's business is focused, the Pearl River Delta Region ( PRD ), the combined tolled traffic for our Guangzhou-Shenzhen Superhighway ( GS Superhighway ), Guangzhou East-South-West Ring Road ( ESW Ring Road ) and Phase I of the Western Delta Route ( Phase I West ) grew by 23% and toll revenues increased by 21% compared to the last financial year. This double-digit growth has propelled our Company s net profit 38% from HK$533 million last financial year to HK$735 million this year.
We have achieved these results in large part due to our commitment to the PRD. HHI s mission has been, and will continue to be providing a safe and reliable integrated expressway, bridge and tunnel network in the PRD to meet the necessary demands of vehicular traffic.
Over a decade ago, we opened the first, and what is now still, the only expressway connecting Shenzhen to Guangzhou. At the time of opening, GS Superhighway s average daily traffic was a mere 30,000, but today, with the rapid growth in the PRD, this figure has increased over 6-fold to over 200,000 vehicles per day.
Attesting to our continued commitment to a complete expressway network in the PRD, 2004 also saw HHI open a new expressway, Phase I West. This is a 14.7 km stretch of expressway that links our ESW Ring Road in Guangzhou to Shunde, reducing what would normally have been a 40-minute trip to a quick 10-minute drive. I am particularly proud of this project as it was completed 2 months ahead of schedule.

As a result of the solid growth in our expressways, our net profit for financial year 2004 increased 38% to HK$735 million from last year, exceeding the forecast profit of HK$700 million as stated in the Company s initial public offering prospectus dated 28th July, 2003, translating to an increase in basic earnings per share from HK24.7 cents to HK26.2 cents. The Board of Directors has proposed a final dividend of HK12.5 cents per share which, together with the interim dividend of HK10 cents per share, will result in total dividends for the year of HK22.5 cents per share, same as the intended amount to be recommended by the Board of Directors as stated in the prospectus.
At the time of opening, GS Superhighway s average daily traffic was a mere 30,000, but today, with the rapid growth in the PRD, this figure has increased over 6-fold to over 200,000 vehicles per day.
The Register of members and warrantholders of the Company will be closed from Monday, 11th October, 2004 to Monday, 18th October, 2004, both days inclusive, during which no transfer of shares and no transfer or exercise of warrants of the Company will be effected. Subject to approval of the shareholders at the annual general meeting to be held on 18th October, 2004, the final dividend will be paid on or about 18th October, 2004 to shareholders as registered at the close of business on 18th October, 2004.
The Group s core earnings, defined as net profit excluding interest income from shareholder s loan and income from debt securities investments, increased 37% from HK$507 million to HK$693 million. This was driven by the continued strong growth in GS Superhighway and ESW Ring Road operations.
Financial year 2003 2004 Growth rate 
Average Daily Traffic (No. of vehicles) 155,394 188,768 22% Average Daily Revenue (RMB) 5,778,931 6,901,461 20% ESW Ring Road Average Daily Traffic (No. of vehicles) 38,930 47,516 22% Average Daily Revenue (RMB) 590,053 747,909 27% Phase I West Average Daily Traffic (No. of vehicles) NA 11,459 NA Average Daily Revenue (RMB) NA 166,025 NA The Group s balance sheet remains very strong. Net gearing (total debt less bank balances and cash, pledged bank deposits and debt securities investments to total equity) for financial year 2004 stood at 35%, compared to 104% in financial year 2003. Operating cashflow of the Group totaled HK$1,257 million in financial year 2004, a 24% increase over last year. Combined, our current favourable gearing levels and operating cashflow positions will allow for a strong platform for growth for future projects.
The 79-fold growth in GDP in the PRD from 1980 to 2002, and the expected continued growth in the coming years will undoubtedly benefit HHI s operations.
Business Review and Outlook HHI s business strategy continues to be focused on the PRD. As far back as the early 1980 s, HHI had already shown its commitment to the PRD, envisaging the need to provide a transportation backbone to support the future economic growth in the region. Since then, the growth of the PRD has been fuelled by competitive labour and production costs and the rapid development of factories for industries such as electronics, textiles, toys and more recently, automobiles. Through the creation of Closer Economic Partnership Arrangements ( CEPA ), the Pan-PRD programs, China s World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) membership and the opening of the Guangzhou New Baiyun International Airport, the PRD s growth will be further enhanced. The 79-fold growth in GDP in the PRD from 1980 to 2002, and the expected continued growth in the coming years will undoubtedly benefit HHI s operations.
With the Group s interest in GS Superhighway, ESW Ring Road and Phase I West, HHI is already well into realizing its original plan of creating a Pan-PRD network.
In seeking to complete this network, the Group recently announced in July and August of 2004, the possible co-operation with our Phase I West s PRC partner for the investment in and the planning, design, construction and operation of Phases II and III of the Western Delta Route. With the completion of these phases, vehicles will be able to travel seamlessly on an expressway from the city centers of Shenzhen to Guangzhou, Shunde, Zhongshan and Zhuhai.
I continue to view the proposed Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge project as a vital step in the economic integration of the major cities of the PRD, and I believe that HHI is well-positioned to participate in this project.
Investor Relations and Corporate Governance On the investor relations front, the Company is committed to better transparency of its business by providing the Group s monthly traffic and revenue information for its expressways on the Company s website, www.hopewellhighway.com. Our commitment to keeping investors and analysts abreast of the Company s business and strategy is further evidenced by the numerous conferences, meetings and conference calls we have participated in this year. Further, to expand the Company s investor base, a Level 1 American Depository Receipt program sponsored by the Company in respect of its Hong Kong listed shares was established in the United States and became effective on 26th April, 2004.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank my fellow directors, senior management team, and all staff for their hard work during this past financial year and their commitment to our platform for growth. My gratitude also goes to our shareholders, financiers and business partners for their invaluable support.
