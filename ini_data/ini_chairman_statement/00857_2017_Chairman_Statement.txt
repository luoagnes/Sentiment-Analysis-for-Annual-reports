CHAIRMAN’S REPORT
Dear Shareholders,
I am pleased to submit to you the annual report of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2016
for your review.
In 2016, the global economic recovery was slow, and China’s economy experienced the same situation but
tended to be stable, with the overall developments maintained within a reasonable range. The overall supply and
demand in the global oil and gas market was generally relaxed and the international oil prices kept fluctuating at
a low level. Despite the complicated and severe domestic and international economic environment, the Group
adhered to steady development, made overall plans for resources and markets both in the PRC and abroad,
focused on developing its principal business of oil and gas operations, adjusted and optimised its production
and operation based on market changes, continuously reformed and renovated on management models and
improved operating systems, intensified measures for broadening sources of income and reducing expenditure
as well as cutting costs and enhancing efficiency, and reinforced the base of safety and environmental protection.
As a result, the production and operation of the Group was stable and under control and the operating results
were better than the expectations. In 2016, due to such factors as the fall in the prices of crude oil, natural
gas and refined products as compared with last year, the Group achieved a revenue of RMB1,616,903 million,
representing a decrease of 6.3% as compared with last year, and the net profit attributable to owners of the
Company was RMB7,857 million, representing a decrease of 77.9% as compared with last year.
Business Prospects
In 2017, the global economy is expected to continue to recover moderately. As the global oil market
gradually tends to be balanced, the international oil price is likely to rebound, but may still involve relatively
great uncertainty. China’s economy is expected to keep growing in a moderately stable way, the consumption
demand for oil and gas in China maintains a growth momentum as a whole, profound changes take place in
the oil and gas market and the growth drive generates from the accelerated major strategies such as the The
Belt and Road Initiative, reforms in energy pricing and the oil and gas systems, which creates opportunities
for the organisation of production and the development of markets by the Group and facilitates the long-term
business development of the Group. The Group will continue to adhere to its steady development guidelines,
fully implement its four major strategies regarding resources, markets, internationalisation and innovation, place
