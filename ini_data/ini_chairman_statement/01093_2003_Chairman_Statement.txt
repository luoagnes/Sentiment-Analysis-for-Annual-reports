SineSS reie an rSeCtS 
During the year, both the production capacity and output of the $roups three ma7or bul8 drug series have increased, with equally strong sales. In July 2002, the Group diversified into finished drug business via acquisition from its parent company. he $roup now has more than 1* types of bul8 drug products and 120 types of finished drug products.
hrough the use of new production technology, the Group increased the production rate of penicillin by 1+.3% during the year, thereby maintaining its leading position in the industry. he output of penicillin reached 3,*03 tonnes, representing an increase of 3)% (mainly attributable to penicillin industrial salt). he output of penicillin downstream products was 1,013 tonnes, maintaining the level of previous year. Notwithstanding that 331 tonnes of self-produced penicillin products have been used in the manufacturing of some of the finished drug products during the year, sales volume of the entire series increased by 20% to 3,177 tonnes. Revenue from the entire series increasedby3to"#$%&,'&,000,accountingfor3ofthe(roup)srevenue.

*ith the rising living standard in the +!,, there is an increasing demand for semi-synthetic penicillin products, and we e-pect that the (roup)s penicillin series will maintain a strong growth in 2003.

The output of 7-ACA increased by 60% to &00 tonnes, whereas the output of cefaiolin, a downstream product, reached 1&% tonnes, maintaining the level of previous year. *ith regard to cefopera1one and cefradine, which were put into production last year, output reached 2& tonnes and 27 tonnes respectively. Notwithstanding that 21 tonnes of self-produced cefa1olin have been used in the manufacturing of some of the finished drug products during the year, sales volume of the entire series increased by 45% to 495 tonnes. Revenue from this series increased by 37% to "#$498,707,000, accounting for 31% of the (roup)s revenue.

*ith the commencement of operation of a new 7-ACA production line in 2002, the (roup)s annual capacity reached 800 tonnes of 7-ACA. 2n terms of the actual output in 2002, the (roup ranked third in the world, lagging behind the top two manufacturers by only a small margin. The (roup believes that when the production line attains full capacity, its mar3et share will increase steadily and it will become the world)s second largest manufacturer of 7-ACA. Furthermore, with the rising health consciousness and medication standard of the people in the +!C, growth in the demand for cephalosporin antibiotics remains strong and, therefore, the series will become a ma5or contributor to the proliferation ofthe (roup)s sales and profit.

Vitamin C series 
6uring the year, prices of vitamin C products rebounded strongly as a result of the scaling down of production by the overseas manufacturers. +rices of the products surged from 78$3.06 per 3g on average in 2001 to 78$4.04 per 3gbytheendof2002. The average price for the year reached 78$3.24 per 3g, and there was a supply shortage in the mar3et.
The output ofvitamin C increased by 8% to 12,144 tonnes for the year, while the output of downstream products was 2,026 tonnes, similar to previous year. Sales volume and revenue of the entire series increased by 17% and 26% to 13,371 tonnes and "#$362,003,000 respectively. The revenue from the series accounted for 22% of the (roup)s revenue. Theincreaseinoutputandreboundofpriceshavemadetheseriesbecomeama5orsourceofprofitforthe (roup again. 4or the first two months in 2003, the average price rose to 78$6.4 per 3g. The (roup believes that the current upward momentum in the price of vitamin C will sustain and the contribution from this series will greatly increase in 2003.
Finished drug division The operation of the finished drug division has been smooth since the (roup ac9uired the business in :uly 2002.

The ac9uisition of the finished drug business enabled the (roup to diversify from producing solely bul3 drug products to both bulk and finished drug products. The (roup is now able to e-pand its customer base to hospitals. The (roup believes that such product diversification and e-panded customer base will enable it to better position itself to capture the opportunities in the pharmaceutical market and to e-pand the (roup)s earning base.
With the continued application of new technology and equipment, as well as our proven effective measures in controlling production costs, the manufacturing costs of all our products have been lowered.
