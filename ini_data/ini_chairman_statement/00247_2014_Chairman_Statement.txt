REVIEW OF OPERATIONS

Sino Land s investment property portfolio primarily serves the need of its customers which include tenants, shoppers and the communities around the properties. The design and conditions of the properties together with the quality of service provided to customers are of paramount importance.
To ensure that the properties are in good condition with the proper layout and design, Sino Land would perform regular review of the properties and collect customers feedback to decide if asset enhancement work is required. To assess the effectiveness of capital expenditure, benefits to customers, payback and return on investment will be analysed. On service quality, Sino Land places a strong emphasis on regular training particularly for all front-line staff to ensure that the service provided to customers meet their expectations. Comments from customers, reports by silent shoppers and recognitions from professional institutions all play a role in assessing the quality of service delivered by the staff. These indicators are vital for management to review what additional work needs to be done as part of Sino Land s efforts for continuous improvement.
As at 30th June, 2014, Sino Land has approximately 11.3 million square feet of attributable floor area of investment properties and hotels in Hong Kong, China and Singapore.

Overall business performance of Sino Land s hotels, namely The Fullerton Hotel, The Fullerton Bay Hotel and Conrad Hong Kong was steady during the financial year 20132014. Sino Land will continue to improve the quality of its hotel services to ensure our discerning guests have enjoyable experiences during their stays in the hotels.

REVIEW OF OPERATIONS 
(6) China Business Urbanisation in China has been an integral part of its economic development. The economic benefits derived from movement of human capital have contributed to China s rapid economic growth since the economy took off in the mid-1980s. Over the past three decades, urbanisation has been one of the key focuses for the Central Government in setting economic policy and objectives. With both global and local economies changing over time, a comprehensive policy framework for urbanisation is needed. It will narrow rural-urban inequalities and reduce wealth disparities. The reforms proposed by the new government cover a broad spectrum of areas. Improvements in Hukou (household registration) system, property rights and land title registration system will facilitate the mobility of workers across China and safeguard the interests of the owners of the properties. Easing of one-child policy will also increase demand for consumer products, education as well as housing. Reforms in public finance, the banking system and capital markets including liberalization of interest rates and better access to housing finance are all important to establish a more sustainable consumption-led economy. These reforms are conducive to developing a healthy property market.
Throughout the years, Sino Land has completed a number of projects in Xiamen, Fuzhou and the first phase of its residential project in Zhangzhou.
The experience gained from developing and leasing projects in China has also built Sino Land s execution capability in the country. Sino Land s projects are situated in cities with good economic and demographic fundamentals. The major property developments, namely The Palazzo in Chengdu, The Coronation in Chongqing and Dynasty Park in Zhangzhou will be sold and completed in phases over the next few years.
Other than the matters mentioned above, there has been no material change from the information published in the report and accounts for the financial year ended 30th June, 2013.
FINANCE As at 30th June, 2014, the Group had cash and bank deposits of HK$14,504.2 million.
After netting off total borrowings of HK$11,290.4 million, the Group had net cash of HK$3,213.8 million as at 30th June, 2014. Of the total borrowings, 2.8% was repayable within one year, 38.1% repayable between one and two years and 59.1% repayable between two and five years.
The majority of the Group s debts are denominated in Hong Kong dollars and US dollars, with the balance in Singapore dollars, mainly used to fund The Fullerton Heritage project in Singapore. Other than the above-mentioned, there was no material change in foreign currency borrowings and the capital structure of the Group for the financial year ended 30th June, 2014. The majority of the Group s cash are denominated in Hong Kong dollars, with a portion of Renminbi denominated deposits. The Group has maintained a sound financial management policy and foreign exchange exposure has been prudently kept at a minimal level.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE The Group places great importance on corporate integrity, business ethics and good governance. With the objective of practising good corporate governance, the Group has formed Audit, Compliance, Remuneration and Nomination Committees. The Group is committed to maintaining corporate transparency and disseminates information about new developments through various channels, including press releases, its corporate website, results briefings, site visits, participation in non-deal roadshows and investor

Dedicated to promoting local art and culture, Sino Land initiated Sino Art project in 2006, under which Sino Art provides local and international artists with opportunities to showcase their works through exhibitions and public art installations at Sino Land s properties.

PROSPECTS The U.S. economy has continued to improve with lower unemployment rate.
Since the end of 2013, the Federal Reserve has steadily reduced the pace of the asset purchase programme. With signs of recovery mainly reflected in an improvement in household spending and the U.S. housing market, the outlook of the economy looks positive.
Overall financial conditions in Euro zone have stabilised, but economies remain vulnerable with high unemployment, excess production capacity and deflationary pressure in a number of its member countries. In response to the situation, European Central Bank has lowered interest rates, imposed negative rates on overnight deposits from banks for the first time and provided banks with new long-term funds. It has also started the lending programme of Targeted Long Term Refinancing Operations alongside with other stimulus measures to increase bank lending and to drive economic growth in the years 
China s economy has been growing steadily. Economic, financial and social reforms covering a wide range of areas will lead the economy and society towards a more healthy and sustainable development. As the economic growth in the U.S. continues to strengthen, exports from China should continue to pick up. Combined with the economic forces of domestic consumption-led growth, the gain in momentum in China s economy will have a positive effect on the Hong Kong economy which in turn is supportive to a better business environment for Hong Kong. Economic growth in Hong Kong has been stable with low unemployment and a healthy and prudent 
The Hong Kong property market has been going through a period of change as a result of economic and property-related policies. In February 2014, Legislative Council passed the Stamp Duty (Amendments) Ordinance 2014 in relation to the implementation of Buyer s Stamp Duty and Special Stamp Duty. An amendment to the Double Stamp Duty passed in July 2014 has helped to improve buying sentiment as more projects were launched to market for sale. Primary transaction volume has recently recovered, but with rising construction costs and the property-related policies, there remain sensitivities in the Hong Kong property market. Management will closely monitor the situation and will be responsive to market changes. Sino Land s recurrent businesses, which comprise property leasing, hospitality and property management services, continue to be resilient. With a good financial position, Sino Land is well-positioned to respond to challenges ahead.
Management will continue to optimise earnings, enhance efficiency and productivity and improve the quality of products and services. In respect of property development and property management, Sino Land will incorporate more environmentally friendly elements in its projects. Sino Land will maintain a policy of selectively and continuously replenishing its land bank, which will enable it to strengthen earnings and shareholders value.
STAFF AND MANAGEMENT On behalf of the Board, I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation to all staff for their commitment, dedication and continuing support. I would also like to express my gratitude to my fellow Directors for their guidance and wise counsel.
