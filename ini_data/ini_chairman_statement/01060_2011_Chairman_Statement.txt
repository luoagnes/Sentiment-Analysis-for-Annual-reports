CHAIRMAN S STATEMENT 
To the Shareholders, I am pleased to share with you our progress in developing our businesses in print media, mobile new media and television and film operations in 2010, the major revolutions and the results of the Company as well as our strategic focus and business planning in the future.
The economy and cultural industry in the PRC have experienced rapid growth. In its Twelfth Five-Year Plan, the Chinese Government has also declared that the cultural industry is becoming one of the pillars of the PRC economy. In fact, the cultural industry s rocketing expansion in recent years is making it one of the most dynamic sectors offering outstanding potential. At this initial stage of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, the cultural industry is set to enter a new era growing even more rapidly while undergoing sweeping changes and greater achievements. Against the backdrop of supportive Government policies for the cultural and creative industry, the Group intends to continue expanding all its core businesses.
PRINT MEDIA BUSINESS In first-tier cities within the PRC such as Beijing and Shanghai, JingHua Culture, our print media business, continued to show strong growth momentum thanks to the continuous expansion of the use of advertisements. In the newspaper market in Beijing, advertisers tend to gravitate to the leading newspapers such as Beijing Times. Branding advertisements need print media to reflect its value while property and motor vehicle advertisements tend to rely even more heavily on newspaper advertisements in their marketing efforts.
Growth in the higher end of advertisements shows the competitiveness of our newspaper advertising business and the growth potential of the newspaper industry.
Advertisements in the Beijing Times are principally for motor vehicles, fast moving consumer products, home appliances and new generation digital products. Stunning growth was recorded in the operating results of our advertising business in 2010, which was at the front of the overall growth trend exhibited by the newspaper industry in Beijing. Motor vehicle advertisements increased twofold, while property advertising underwent notable growth and is expected to further increase during 2011. Beijing Times has established a stylish business division which will help it expand its share in the high-end advertisement market.
2011 marks the 10th anniversary of Beijing Times. The newspaper is planning to launch a series of brand promotion activities based on its core strength in credibility, influence and communication . One such noteworthy event includes invitations to more than 30 of the most influential TV and film stars, celebrities in the cultural industry and business leaders in the PRC to film a charitable brand advertisement A Brilliant Decade for Beijing TimesNBf1Xi_ASt which will be broadcast across the country. This specialty promotion will also enhance the leading influence of Beijing Times as a popular mainstream media brand.

PRINT MEDIA BUSINESS (Continued) The JingHua Website of Beijing Times has been revamped and has established a new online version with an aim to build a new comprehensive digital media platform. To achieve this aim, a new Siheyuan concept is being created to build up a Beijing community forum. JingHua mobile new media is to offer e-book reader, mobile newspaper, e-newspaper, Hyun reading, and reading materials for both iPad and iPhone users.
As announced on 30th December, 2010, the Group has started the preparatory efforts for the A-share listing of JingHua Culture in Mainland China. The listing of JingHua Culture is expected to bring in new capital and enhance its shareholding structure, which will pave the way to enrich its media resources. This will provide a solid foundation for JingHua Culture to develop into a multi-media company that encompasses print media, mobile new media and film and TV media. This will be Beijing Times the most favorable in the years after the founding of the major events.
The Group will continue to expand its print media business while enhancing the synergies among the operations and businesses of its various publications, and consolidate its media resources with the aim of providing comprehensive advertising and marketing services to its customers.

China Mobile s revenue derived from mobile TV services recorded a year-on-year increase of 200% in 2010, and is expected to grow a further 100% during 2011. The Group s mobile TV applications have been provided to the three largest telecom operators and are now available on the mobile platforms of mainstream players including Symbian, Android and iPhone, among others.

Television drama contents have also become popular broadcast programmes on mobile TV. Such synergies are expanding and will bring more benefits to the Group.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Review of Operations The Cultural Industry Promotion Plan (eS"umicR) of the State Council and The Guidance re Financial Support of Cultural Industries and Revitalisation and Development and Prosperity (ee ceS"umicT|vUAivca) pronouncement jointly issued by nine ministries and commissions demonstrates the strategic importance the state placed on the cultural industry. In a session Push Forward the Reform of the Cultural System (meQc2eS6R9ei) held in July 2010, the Central Government advanced four major strategies: Guidance to quicken innovation and reform of the cultural system, establish a public cultural service system, quicken the development of the cultural industry, and strengthen the creation and production of cultural products for attainment of the mission.
With the supportive policy direction reiterated in the Twelfth Five-Year Plan by the Chinese Government, the cultural industry in the PRC has experienced rapid growth. The Group has managed to successfully seize the opportunity and achieved significant progress in print media business, mobile new media business and the television and film business during the year under review. A majority of these businesses were carried out in the PRC. Apart from these media related businesses, the Group was also engaged in the securities trading and investments, and distribution of cement business.
In addition to the favourable Government policies towards the cultural industry, the Group also gained support from the financial and film industries. In June 2010, the Group secured a RMB1 billion credit facility from the Bank of Beijing for the development of its core cultural businesses covering the television drama and film production, newspaper media as well as operation of new media businesses. This is by far the largest credit facility granted to a privately held listed company in the cultural industry by a local bank. In the same month, China Film Group Corporation ( CFGC ) and the Group established a strategic alliance, under which various audio and visual programming materials will be broadcasted via the Group s mobile TV business and new media platform. These medium contents include worldwide films for which CFGC owns the copyrights, as well as other audio and visual clips, images and pictures and related new media audio and visual programmes.

The decline in segment revenue and profit was primarily resulted from the Group s disposal of the manufacturing business of cement and clinker during 2009.
