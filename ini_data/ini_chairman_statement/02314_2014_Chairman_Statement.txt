In China, the market is seeing slackened growth with the possibility of interest rate rise. The Group is ready for these challenges.

Of course, while pursuing capacity growth, the management of the Group will also make strenuous efforts together to strictly control costs and strengthen capital operations in order to maintain the Group s market competitiveness in the paper industry. As the Chairman of the Company, I will ensure that the Group s business will continue to grow under the leadership of an experienced and capable management team, with a view to further enhancing the Group s profitability.
