06 HANG SENG BANK Chairman s Statement The impact of the Industrial Bank reclassification in 2013 and impairment loss in 2014 saw profit attributable to shareholders and earnings per share both fall by 43% to HK$15,131m and HK$7.91 respectively. Excluding these items, profit attributable to shareholders increased by 0.4% to HK$17,234m and earnings per share rose by 0.3% to HK$9.01.
Return on average shareholders funds for 2014 was 13.4%, compared with 25.4% in the previous year.
Excluding the Industrial Bank reclassification in 2013 and impairment loss in 2014, return on average shareholders funds was 16.3%, compared with 17.6% in 2013.
The Directors have declared a fourth interim dividend of HK$2.30 per share, bringing the total distribution for 2014 to HK$5.60 per share, up from HK$5.50 per share in 2013.

The global economy grew at a modest pace in 2014. Underpinned by stronger domestic demand, improved GDP growth in the US offset relatively slower growth in the Eurozone. In Japan, an increase in the valueadded tax rate dampened domestic demand during the second half of the year.
Hong Kong s economy expanded by 2.4% during the first three quarters of the year, supported by buoyant labour market conditions and improvement in the balance of trade. Stronger US demand and the continuing health of the domestic balance sheet should enable the city to withstand economic headwinds and remain on a growth track. We forecast real GDP growth of 2.6% for 2015 a modest increase on the 2.2% we expect for 2014.
In mainland China, the property market correction and the overhang of surplus capacity have led to a slowdown in economic expansion. GDP growth for 2014 was 7.4%, compared with 7.7% in 2013. Economic challenges will persist in 2015, but resilient domestic consumption and government efforts to stimulate economic activity will provide support for growth. We expect GDP growth to be lower in 2015 compared with 2014, but still above 7.0%.
In a challenging economic environment, Hang Seng maintained good growth momentum in 2014. Capitalising on our strong market position and brand, we leveraged our competitive strength to improve efficiency and provide an enhanced service experience for customers.
ANNUAL REPORT 2014 07 The normalisation of US monetary policy and the possibility of a structural slowdown on the Mainland will continue to create uncertainty and downside risk in the Asian region. However, initiatives to further strengthen economic ties between Hong Kong and the Mainland, including the launch of the ShanghaiHong Kong Stock Connect scheme in November 2014, and steps to further promote the internationalisation of the renminbi, continue to create opportunities for sustainable business growth.
