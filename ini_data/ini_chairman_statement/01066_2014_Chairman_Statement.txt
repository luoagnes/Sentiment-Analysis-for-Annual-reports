For the year ended 31 December 2013, the Group recorded a turnover of RMB4,613,310,000, representing an increase of 25.1% over the previous financial year.
Net profit attributable to the owners of the Company was approximately RMB387,984,000 (2012net profit attributable to the owners of the Company of approximately RMB996,486,000), representing a decrease of approximately 61.1% as compared with the previous year. Net profit attributable to the owners of the Company excluding extraordinary items (which include the effect on disposal of operation of Biosensors International Group, Ltd.
( BIG ) and exchange differences) was approximately RMB936,941,000 (2012: net profit attributable to the owners of the Company of approximately RMB852,172,000 excluding the effect of operation of BIG and exchange differences), representing an increase of approximately 9.9% over the previous year.

During the Year, the business growth of the Group was in line with our expectation. The new sales organisation for single use consumables has been established following the restructuring. The Group s gross profit margin increased to 59.1% from 57.3% in the previous year was mainly due to the resumption of the independent sales operation by Weigao s orthopaedic business. The disposal of all of its equity interest in BIG by the Group had an one-off impact on its net profit.

(4) The Group disposed all of its equity interest in BIG for a consideration of US$312,283,973 on 21 November 2013, from which an accounting loss of approximately RMB497,421,000 was recorded.
