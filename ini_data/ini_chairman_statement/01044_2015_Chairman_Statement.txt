Chairman s Statement 
On behalf of Hengan International Group Company Limited ( Hengan International or the Group ), I present its annual results for the year ended 31 December 2014. During the year under review, the economy of eurozone remained weak, but that of the United States gradually recovered, which supported the world s moderate economic growth. The Chinese government also launched a number of targeted easing policies to prolong the consistent growth of its economy. The steady pace of growth in the country s gross domestic product and the Chinese people s rising living standard and awareness of hygiene continued to add an impetus to the expansion of the markets for high-quality personal and household hygiene products.
As a leading company in the market for personal care and family hygiene products in mainland China, Hengan leverages its brand equity and outstanding corporate governance to grasp market opportunities and drive its consistent business growth.
For the year ended 31 December 2014, the Group s revenue rose by about 12.5% to approximately HK$23,830,778,000 (2013: HK$21,186,368,000). Profit attributable to shareholders increased by about 5.2% to approximately HK$3,915,818,000 (2013: HK$3,721,031,000). Basic earnings per share were approximately HK$3.188 (2013: HK$3.024).
The Board of Directors recommended the payment of a final dividend of HK$1.15 per share (2013: HK$1.00), which together with the interim dividend of HK$0.85 per share (2013 1H: HK$0.85), brings the annual dividend to HK$2.00 per share (2012: HK$1.85).
During the year, the Group proactively responded to intense market competition, thus making satisfactory progress in its major business. The tissue paper business continued to be the Group s major revenue source, accounting for approximately 45.6% of its total revenue. The businesses of sanitary napkin and disposable diaper maintained growth, and accounted for approximately 31.2% and 13.0% respectively of the Group s total revenue. The business of food and snacks accounted for 6.4% of the Group s total revenue. Benefitting from the optimized product portfolio which proved to be effective, as well as the drop in prices of such major raw materials as tissue wood pulp and petrochemical products since the second half of 2014, the Group s businesses of tissue paper, sanitary napkin and disposable diapers saw their gross profit margins 
Hengan International upholds its corporate spirit of integrity, diligence, innovation and dedication. In face of market consolidation and the challenges of ever-changing demand of consumers, the Group is committed to enhancing product quality and optimizing the product mix, thus successfully achieving business growth. In 2014, the Group was named by Forbes Magazine as one of the World s Most Innovative Companies . The Group was also selected as one of the Top 100 Hong Kong Stocks for 2014 . It also won The Excellence of Listed Enterprise Awards 2014 and the title of the Model Enterprise for Sustainable Development Leadership 2014 in recognition of its outstanding performance and market position.
In 2015, the United States gradual economic recovery will drive the growth of the global economy, but the uncertain outlook of the Europe s economy continues to cast a shadow over the global economic prospect. China is still facing the pressure of an economic slowdown.
Nevertheless, the country s rising personal income and accelerating urbanization have laid the solid foundations for the development of its market for personal hygiene products. In addition, the Group will be able to benefit from the decline in the cost of raw materials, which began in the second half of 2014 and is expected to continue well into 2015, and thus the Group s overall revenue and gross profit margins are expected to improve in 2015. The Group will continue to optimize its product mix and grasp the opportunities to tap the ever-increasing demand with a view to improving its profitability. With its solid business and nationwide distribution network, the Group is confident of maintaining its leading position in mainland China s personal hygiene product market and will strive for consistent growth in its business on the back of the country s steady 
I would like to express my gratitude to every member of staff for their continuous effort that contributed to the growth of Hengan International in the year under review. I would also like to thank the shareholders for their enduring support of the Group s development aspirations and strategies. In return, the entire staff of Hengan International will continue to work hard to create higher values for the shareholders.
