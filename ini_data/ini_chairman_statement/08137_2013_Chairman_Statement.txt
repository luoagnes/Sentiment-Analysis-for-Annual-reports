Chairman s Statement 
I report the activities of the Company and its subsidiaries (together the Group ) for the year ended 31 
Sales of the Group s highly purified silicon decreased 85% year on year in 2012. Due to the decreasing price of the highly purified silicon products, this segment is incurring a greater loss and the Company has reduced 
The mineral resources and steel metal trading arm contributed HK$407 million revenue to the Group which provided steady cashflow and good return to the Group. Compared to 2011, segment revenue decreased from HK$1,698 million to HK$407 million which is mainly due to the change of the Group s trading pattern and revenue from most of the sales transactions in 2012 was recognised in net basis in accordance with the accounting standards. Segment loss was reduced from HK$332 million in 2011 to HK$180 million in 2012, that was mainly due to the decrease in impairment loss of exploration and evaluation assets and the cessation of the loss-making mineral resources trading business in Latin America in 2012.

Since entering into a share purchase agreement on 5 March 2010 with an independent third party Grupo Votorantim s wholly owned subsidiary Votorantim Novos Negcios Ltda. ( VNN ) to acquire 100% interest of a company having rich iron mineral resources in Brazil Sul Americana de Metais S.A. ( SAM ), the Group has made substantial progress towards and is at the final stage of the completion of the acquisition.
The directors believe that the acquisitions of SAM will make the business strategy and scope of the Company more focused. Our resources and energy sector (especially the iron ore project) will become the Group s principal business in the near future.

On behalf of the Board, I would like to take this opportunity to thank our shareholders, customers and cooperative partners for their continued support during 2012 and all staff for their hard work.
