under our school development plan for the 20172018 and 20182019 school years, we will continue to build more middle and elementary schools in those second and third tier cities in China for providing feeders to our high schools located in nearby cities. this will help us establish a pyramid structure of student enrolment from elementary to high schools. in this regard, the asset light model by partnering with public or private entities remains our focused strategy. the Group will also consider opening schools in first tier cities in China such as Beijing and Shenzhen within the next two school years. Moreover, we will also explore some potential acquisition opportunities in China that will create a synergy with the Group and fit the educational philosophy of Maple leaf.
