Chairman’s Statement
Consolidated revenue of the Group was up 23% from fiscal year
2006 to HK$10,426.8 million. Earnings before interest and tax
(“EBIT”) increased by 13% to HK$2,223.0 million over previous
year. Volume sales were up around 14% with average monthly
shipment reaching 7.7 million square meters. Revenue growth
outpaced volume growth largely due to the faster sales growth
of glass epoxy laminates which commanded higher selling price
than paper laminates. Average selling price (“ASP”) of laminate
increased over previous year for both paper and glass epoxy
laminates as a result of high raw material costs during the year.
The new glass epoxy laminate plant in Jiangyin, Jiangsu province
commenced production in April 2007 and reached monthly
output of 600,000 sheets by end of 2007. Our glass epoxy
laminate manufacturing facility in Fogang, Guangdong province
also increased its output by 400,000 sheets per month in 2007.
Subsequent to these expansion initiatives, total monthly glass
epoxy laminate production capacity for the Group increased by 1
million sheets against the previous year. This was in line with our
strategy to reinforce our presence in PCB manufacturing hubs in
both southern and eastern China so as to serve our customers
with timely delivery of quality laminate products. To bolster our
level of vertical integration, production capacity of other upstream
materials, such as copper foil, bleached kraft paper and epoxy
resin was also increased during the year.
The increase in distribution costs by 15% was in line with the
increased product shipment. Compared to the magnitude of the
revenue growth, administrative expenses increased by only 13%
as a result of better operating leverage. Finance cost amounted
to HK$168.1 million, mainly relating to the interest expenses
incurred on the 5-year term loan facility of HK$2.5 billion drawn
in December 2006 and trust receipt loans drawn to fund our
working capital.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our consolidated financial and liquidity position continued to be
strong. As at 31 December 2007, net current assets and current
ratio of the Group were approximately HK$4,538.7 million (31
December 2006 – HK$3,873.0 million) and 2.92 (31 December
2006 – 2.87), respectively.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (continued)
The net working capital cycle improved slightly to 121 days as at
31 December 2007 from 124 days as at 31 December 2006 on
the following key metrics:
– Inventories, in terms of stock turnover days, decreased to
72 days (31 December 2006 – 81 days)
– Trade receivables including amounts due from fellow
subsidiaries, in terms of debtors turnover days, stayed
unchanged at 100 days (31 December 2006 – 100 days)
– Trade and bills payables including amounts due to
fellow subsidiaries, in terms of creditors turnover days,
decreased to 51 days (31 December 2006 – 57 days)
The Group’s net gearing ratio (ratio of interest bearing borrowings
net of cash and cash equivalents to total equity) improved
marginally to 23% (31 December 2006 – 24%) as a result of
our positive operating cash inflow after funding working capital
requirement, payment of interest and tax and capital expenditure
during the reporting year. In 2007, the Group invested HK$1,364
million in new production capacity and made deposits for
properties, plant and equipment of HK$222 million. We also paid
interim dividend of HK$300 million in September 2007 in respect
of the year ended 31 December 2007.
The proportion of bank borrowings between short term and long
term was 20%:80% (31 December 2006: 18%:82%). As of 31
December 2007, the Group had committed bank lines of HK$565
million. Together with cash on hand of HK$1.4 billion, the Group
is in a strong financial position to invest in future earnings growth.
Only 1% of the bank borrowings was denominated in Renminbi
and the rest in Hong Kong or US dollars.
The Group continued to adopt a prudent financial management
policy. Subsequent to the 2007 year end, we have entered
interest rate swap agreements of notional amount of HK$1.5
billion with reputable financial institutions in order to secure lower
interest rates for part of our bank borrowings in the next few
years. There was no material foreign exchange exposure to the
Group during the year under review. The Group’s revenue, mostly
dominated in Hong Kong dollars, Renminbi and US dollars,
was fairly matched with the currency requirement of operating
expenses.
HUMAN RESOURCES
As at 31 December 2007, the Group had a workforce of over
8,600 (31 December 2006: 7,200). The increase in headcount
was in line with our ongoing expansion blueprint. In addition
to offering competitive salary package, the Group grants
discretionary bonuses to eligible employees based on our overall
financial achievement and their individual performance.
PROSPECTS
With an excellent growth track record, we are confident that the
competitive advantages gained in the past will enable the Group
to seize new opportunities and continue to invest for sustainable
growth. Although the recent slow down in the US economy
has posted a challenge to the entire manufacturing sector,
we believe, in light of our financial strength and solid business
fundamentals, the Group will continue to create shareholders
value and, similar to other downturns in the past, make further
advancement against our competitors.
PROSPECTS (continued)
Demand for laminates at the start of 2008 experienced brief
softness due to seasonal effect of Chinese Lunar New Year.
The power shortage and logistic bottleneck caused by the
snowstorm in eastern and southern China provinces had caused
temporary disruption to certain production facilities located in the
north of Guangdong province for about one week. The affected
operations have since then resumed full production. In view of
fast growing PCB demand in emerging markets including China,
we will continue capacity expansion at our laminate plants in
Fogang, Guangdong province and Jiangyin, Jiangsu province to
bring total laminate monthly production capacity to 10.6 million
square meters, up 10% by the end of 2008. Our new glass yarn
plant in Qingyuan, Guangdong province was slightly behind
schedule as bad weather in the second half of 2007 had caused
delay in the construction work. Nevertheless, trial production
had commenced towards end January 2008 and monthly output
will reach 2,500 tonnes once the plant is fully ramp up. Glass
fabric and copper foil production capacity will also expand
in the new financial year in order to secure a stable supply of
critical upstream materials to support our expansion blueprint.
To capitalise on our broad customer base with diverse product
requirements, the Group is continuously developing high end
laminate products including thin and high performance laminates.
APPRECIATION
Finally, on behalf of the Board, I would like to take this opportunity
to express my sincere gratitude to our shareholders, customers,
banks, the management and employees for their unreserved
support to the Group in the past year.
