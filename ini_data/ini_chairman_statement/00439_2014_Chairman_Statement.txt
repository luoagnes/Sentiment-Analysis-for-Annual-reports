CHAIRMAN S STATEMENT On behalf of the board of directors (the Board ), I would like to present the annual results of Climax International Company Limited (the Company ) and its subsidiaries (the Group ) for the financial year ended 31 March 2014.
For the year ended 31 March 2014, the Group recorded turnover of approximately HK$113,433,000 and loss attributable to shareholders of approximately HK$37,908,000 as compared to a profit attributable to the shareholders for the corresponding year ended 31 March 2013 while loss per share is approximately 2.70 Hong Kong cents for the year. The loss was mainly caused by the drop of the operating profit and the recognition of significant impairment loss of goodwill for the Paper Business and the absence of the gain on changes in fair value of investment properties as compared to last corresponding year.
Subsequently on 29 May 2014, the Company and certain subscribers ( Subscribers ) entered into a subscription agreement ( Subscription Agreement ), pursuant to which the Subscribers have conditionally agreed to subscribe for, and the Company has conditionally agreed to allot and issue, a total of 4,350,000,000 subscription shares ( Subscription Share(s) ), comprising 1,666,666,668 new ordinary shares and 2,683,333,332 new preferred shares at an issue price of HK$0.08 per Subscription Share.
Pursuant to the Subscription Agreement, an outsourcing technology development agreement ( OTDA ) will also be entered into between a Group company and Kuang-Chi Innovative Technology Limited ( Kuang-Chi ), being a beneficial owner of one of the Subscribers, for the research and development of a near space civil flying apparatus which is intended to be used to carry devices relating to communication solutions for maritime, land-based and aeronautical uses.
Since Kuang-Chi has extensive experience, strong expertise and a wide business network in the innovative technology industry in the PRC, the Board considers that entering into the Subscription Agreement and the OTDA represent a good opportunity to provide the Company with the financial flexibility necessary for the Group s future business development and the capability to capture any prospective investment opportunities as and when they arise as well as to develop a new business segment in the innovative technology sector in the PRC and to broaden its revenue base. The Board is confident that the Subscribers will bring in additional resources and investment opportunities to the Company which are beneficial to the Company and the Shareholders as a whole.
Finally, on behalf of the Board, I would like to take this opportunity to deliver my most sincere gratitude to the Board members and management team for their devoted commitments during the year and look forward to their continuous support in the years
