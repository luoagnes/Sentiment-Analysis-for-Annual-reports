CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Business Review
For the fiscal year of 2006/2007, a growth in containerboard sales was
observed with 1.67 million tons of containerboard and 102,000 tons of
pulp sold (another 100,000 tons of pulp was self-used); and the total
sales volume was 1.77 million tons. The Group achieved a turnover of
HK$5,161 million and has recorded a net profit of HK$1,010 million.
This represents an increase in turnover of 36.6% and an increase in net
profit of 68.3% over last year. During the year, all of our paper production
lines and our pulp mill ran at maximum capacity.
During the year, we saw strong demand for containerboards driven by
higher export and domestic demands of manufactured goods. Further,
our superior technology and our experienced management team allow
us to produce excellent quality products at a lower cost. These two facts
result in significantly higher turnover and higher margins.
Outlook
The Group is fully confident of the market. The Group will install seven
world-class paper production lines and two bleached hardwood kraft
pulp (BHKP) production lines. In fact, PM8 and PM9, with a total annual
capacity of 860,000 tons have already started production in the first half
of 2007. PM10, PM11, with a total annual capacity of 600,000 tons, will
commence production before September 2007. The remaining three
paper production lines and two pulp production lines are also scheduled
to start production within 2008. With this expansion, the Group’s annual
pulp and paper capacity will reach 4,700,000 tons (500,000 tons of
pulp and 4,200,000 tons of containerboard), making the Group one of
the largest pulp and paper producers in the world. Just as important, we
are extending our geographic coverage with two of our paper production
lines (PM13 and PM15) and two pulp mills (BHKP1 and BHKP2) are
scheduled to start at our new production sites in Chongqing and Vietnam
in 2008 and will make contribution to the Group’s profit.
Our challenges are beyond pure financial gains. With increasing social
awareness in environmental protection, we are investing in the world’s
most advanced technology to reduce water and energy consumption
and to reduce the quantity of effluents produced. With these investments,
we hope to lead the industry to a greener and healthier future, while
becoming one of the largest and most important pulp and paper
producers in the world.
