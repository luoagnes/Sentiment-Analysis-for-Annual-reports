2015 was a challenging year for both Want Want and China. It was the first time that the results of Want Want had retreated for two consecutive years since it entered the China market in 1994. Many people were of the view that the subdued performance was attributable to either the macro environment or the general economic condition. However, I believe that China remains the biggest consumer market in the world and the key to success is to make timely adjustments according to the changing conditions of the market, find appropriate solutions and strategies and execute them with determination, thereby turning adversity into opportunity .

In 2015, as affected by the adverse results of dairy products and beverages and popsicles, the Company recorded a revenue of US$3,427.7 million, representing a decrease of 9.2% from that of the year 2014. However, gross profit margin increased by 3.7 percentage points to 43.9% as compared with that of 2014, attributable mainly to the decrease in cost of some key raw materials. The amount of gross profit decreased by 1.0% to US$1,504.3 million as compared with that of 2014, due mainly to the weak top-line performance. Generally, the overall operating expenses were well controlled.
The revenue contribution from modern channel increased in 2015 over the year 2014 and our advertising and promotion expenses to revenue ratio maintained at around 3.6%. Therefore, although our operating profit decreased by 6.2%, as our gross profit margin improved, our operating profit margin also increased by 0.7 percentage point to 21.3%, as compared with that of 2014.

In order to maintain the long-term competitive strength of Want Want products in distribution channels and end stores, we broadly classified the Group s products into Ordinary Star Products and Products with Growth Potential after collecting detailed market information across the nation and formulated different business solutions for each type of products. These solutions share one common feature which is to simplify most of the complicated sales policies, thereby enabling our distributors to be more confident and interested in distributing and selling Want Want products under the new normal economic environment in China.

Furthermore, after interviewing many of our customers, we are confident in the competitive advantages of Want Want products in the market. However, as the Group has a vast variety of products, it is difficult for our management to focus on both the existing and new products. Thus previously, many new products were not well managed and promoted. In 2016, we will integrate our marketing resources and strive for breakthroughs in some new differentiated products. Many investors are concerned about the insufficient advertising and promotion expenses incurred by the Group. In fact, incurring advertising expenses will only be wasting money if relevant products have not yet been put onto shelves. In view of this, we will continue to increase display areas in our selected points of sales, which should make it worthwhile to incur the additional advertising expenses.

Chairman s Statement 
Lastly, in 2015, we achieved better results in modern channel, e-commerce and maternity channels over the previous year. In 2016, we will focus on the preference of target customers in different channels and develop different packaging and product flavors, so as to expand our consumer base. We believe for a long time that only innovation and differentiation could enable the Group to build a solid foundation for long-term sustainable growth.

DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES: The Board recommended the payment of a final dividend of US1.25 cents per share for the year 2015, which is approximately US$160 million in total.
Including the interim dividend of US$80 million, the total amount of dividends for the year 2015 would be approximately US$240 million.

In view of the fluctuation in the share price in 2015, the Group, by way of share repurchase, repurchased 342,000,000 shares of the Company in the open market at a total cost of US$291.8 million.

The Group s total return to our shareholders by ways of dividends and share repurchases for the year 2015 would be approximately US$530 million. This amount is approximately equivalent to the total operating free cash flow after deduction of capital expenditure for the year 2015.

The Group continues to implement a stable dividend policy by returning most of the free cash flow to our shareholders by ways of dividends and share repurchases after reserving funds to satisfy the capital expenditure requirement for future operation and development. Since the listing of the Company in 2008, the Group has returned a total of US$2,693.8 million (excluding the proposed final dividend for the year 2015) to our shareholders by these two means. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all our shareholders for their continuous support.

At the Company s annual dinner held during the Chinese New Year, I mentioned to all members of the management that over the past 41 years, whenever I encountered setbacks and difficulties, I would review the Company motto that I wrote when I was young to look for solutions. I believe that the unique culture of Want Want surpasses all others before and since.
As long as all Want Want staff adhere to the spirit of Want Want, we will be able to regain pride and recognition. We have to make every effort to realise our dream. To build a great long-lasting enterprise, to overcome difficulties and face challenges with courage is a journey that we must go through. As long as over 50,000 Want Want staff members are of one mind, there is no limit to what we can achieve.
