Chairman s Statement Our consolidated profit attributable to shareholders for 2011 was HK$32,210 million, compared to HK$38,252 million in 2010. Underlying profit attributable to shareholders, which principally adjusts for changes in the valuation of investment properties, increased by HK$1,149 million to HK$17,292 million in 2011. The 2011 underlying profit included a profit of HK$8,615 million on disposal of the investment property known as Festival Walk. Excluding the effect of this and other non-recurring items, adjusted underlying profit attributable to shareholders decreased by HK$2,371 million to HK$8,728 million.
The increase in underlying profit principally reflects the profit on disposal of Festival Walk and growth in profits from the Property Division, the Marine Services Division and the Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company Limited ( HAECO ) group. There was a weaker performance from the Cathay Pacific group (which had earned record profits in 2010) and profits fell in the Beverages and Trading & Industrial Divisions.

The Directors have declared a second interim dividend (in lieu of a final dividend) of HK$2.35 per A share and HK$0.47 per B share which, together with the first interim dividend of HK$1.15 per A share and HK$0.23 per B share and the special interim dividend of HK$3.00 per A share and HK$0.60 per B share paid in October 2011, amount to full year dividends of HK$6.50 per A share and HK$1.30 per B share, compared to full year dividends of HK$3.50 per A share and HK$0.70 per B share in respect of 2010. The second interim dividend will be paid on 4th May 2012 to shareholders registered at the close of business on the record date, being Friday, 13th April 2012. Shares of the Company will be traded ex-dividend as from Wednesday, 11th April 2012.
The register of members will be closed on Friday, 13th April 2012, during which day no transfer of shares will be effected.
In order to qualify for entitlement to the second interim dividend, all transfer forms accompanied by the relevant share certificates must be lodged with the Company s share registrars, Computershare Hong Kong Investor Services Limited, 17th Floor, Hopewell Centre, 183 Queen s Road East, Hong Kong, for registration not later than 4:30 p.m. on Thursday, 12th April 2012.

During 2011, the Group acquired an additional 2% interest in Cathay Pacific for a total cost of HK$1,236 million, increasing its interest to 44.97%.
During 2011, Swire Pacific Offshore ( SPO ) committed to purchase an additional 27 vessels for delivery between 2011 and 2015. These commitments reflect SPO s strategy of rebalancing the fleet between anchor handling tug supply vessels and platform supply vessels and focusing the new building programme on vessels capable of operating in deeper waters, where demand is expected to be greatest.
In March 2011, Cathay Pacific announced orders for 27 new aircraft, including two Airbus A350-900s (which had been ordered in December 2010), 15 Airbus A330-300s and 10 Boeing 777-300ERs. In August 2011, Cathay Pacific announced the acquisition of four more Boeing 777-300ERs and eight Boeing 777-200F freighters. In January 2012, Cathay Pacific announced the purchase of six Airbus A350-900s. These new aircraft are expected to be delivered before the end of 2017.
In April 2011, Swire Properties acquired two parcels of land adjoining the existing Brickell CitiCentre development in Miami, USA. Development entitlements have been approved by the City of Miami for a special area plan, which allows for a mixed-use development of approximately 2.9 million square feet of gross floor area (excluding car park and 
In August 2011, Swire Properties sold its entire interest in the property in Hong Kong known as Festival Walk for a total net consideration of HK$18.8 billion. A net gain of HK$638 million on this sale, which excludes gains on revaluation of the property previously credited to the income statement up to 30th June 2011, was included in the attributable profit for 2011. The underlying profit on the sale, which is calculated by reference to the original cost of the property to the Group, was HK$8,615 million.
In September 2011, the retail space at TaiKoo Hui, a 3.8 million square foot mixed-use development in the Tianhe district of Guangzhou, opened. Handover of the office space to tenants commenced in August 2011. The hotel and serviced apartments are scheduled to open in the second half of 2012.
In October 2011, the Group submitted a proposal to The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited for the spin-off and separate listing of shares in Swire Properties by way of introduction.
The listing of Swire Properties shares, which took effect in January 2012, was achieved by a distribution in specie by Swire Pacific of approximately 18% of the shares in Swire Properties. Following the listing, Swire Pacific s shareholding in Swire Properties was reduced to 82%.

Underlying profit from the Property Division was HK$12,673 million, a 164% increase from HK$4,794 million in 2010.
Underlying profit included the profit of HK$8,615 million on disposal of Festival Walk. Excluding the effect of this and other non-recurring items, the underlying profit of the Property Division was HK$4,113 million, an increase of 6% over 2010. The increase principally reflects positive rental reversions and stronger turnover rents in Hong Kong, resulting in an overall increase of 9% in gross rental income. The operating performance of the owned and managed hotels in Hong Kong and Beijing was much improved. The positive effect of these favourable factors was offset in part by the loss of rental income following the disposal of Festival Walk and worse results from the property trading portfolio as a result of a reduction in sales volumes and sales and marketing costs incurred in connection with the residential developments in 
On an attributable basis, the Property Division s net investment property valuation gain in 2011, before deferred tax in Mainland China, was HK$20,899 million, compared to a net gain in 2010 of HK$22,274 million. The increase in the valuation of the investment property portfolio (most of which took place in the first half of 2011) principally reflects higher 
The Aviation Division recorded an attributable profit of HK$2,999 million in 2011, compared to HK$8,901 million in 2010. Non-recurring items included the attributable profit of HK$825 million arising on the disposal of interests in Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited ( Hactl ) and a gain of HK$2,547 million on the remeasurement of our previously held interest in HAECO to fair value. Excluding the effect of these and other non-recurring items, the attributable profit of the Aviation Division decreased by HK$2,305 million or 42%. Our share of the profit of the Cathay Pacific group was HK$2,405 million in 2011, compared with HK$5,079 million in 2010. In 2011 the core business of the Cathay Pacific group was materially affected by instability and uncertainty in the world s major economies. The business was also adversely affected by natural disasters in Japan and Thailand, the political situation in the Middle East and high jet fuel prices.
The passenger business of Cathay Pacific and Dragonair held up relatively well. The cargo business was weak.
Cathay Pacific benefited from the strong profits earned by its associated company, Air China.
The results of the HAECO group improved in 2011. Profit attributable to shareholders was HK$615 million in 2011, an increase of HK$173 million or 39% compared with the corresponding figure in 2010. Demand for HAECO s services in Hong Kong remained strong and there was a significant improvement in Taikoo (Xiamen) Aircraft Engineering Company Limited ( TAECO ) s performance in Mainland China, reflecting better utilisation of its hangars.
The results of Hong Kong Aero Engine Services Limited ( HAESL ) and Singapore Aero Engine Services Pte. Limited ( SAESL ) benefited from an increase in workload. However, other subsidiaries and the joint ventures in Mainland China continued to make losses as a result of the costs of developing capabilities in their operations, high wage inflation, the strength of the Renminbi and increased competition.
The Beverages Division recorded an attributable profit of HK$588 million, a decrease of 16% from 2010 after taking account of the HK$69 million loss incurred in 2011 by the newly formed Campbell Swire joint venture. Overall sales volume grew by 8% to 995 million unit cases, compared with 2% growth in 2010. Profits increased in Mainland China by 31% to HK$265 million due to a 10% increase in volume, higher prices and an improved sales mix. However, in other markets, price increases (where these were possible) and improvements in the sales mix were insufficient to offset the effect of raw material cost increases.
The Marine Services Division recorded an attributable profit of HK$863 million, a 9% increase from 2010. The 2011 result includes a profit of HK$79 million on disposal of seven vessels during the year. Excluding this profit and the impairment of HK$57 million recorded in 2010, attributable profit fell by 8% compared to 2010. 2011 saw a gradual improvement in the offshore energy market. Oil prices of more than US$100 per barrel supported an increase in exploration and production commitments by the oil majors and utilisation improved during the year. However, the over-supply of new tonnage entering the industry continued to restrict the recovery in charter hire rates. An increase of 22% in operating costs also contributed to the decrease in profits.
Disregarding non-recurring items, the attributable profit from the Trading & Industrial Division decreased by 21% in 2011 to HK$339 million. The decrease principally reflected the absence of contributions from PUMA (the interest in which was sold in January 2011) and CROWN Beverage Cans group (the interest in which was sold in September 2010).

Demand for the Group s office space in Hong Kong is likely to be affected by uncertain market conditions. Low vacancy rates and the fact that supply of new office space will be modest should mitigate the effect on rental income. The available office space will increase in 2012 with the completion of the 145,390 square foot building at 28 Hennessy Road and the 81,346 square foot building at 8 Queen s Road East, expected to take place in the second half of the year.
Consumer demand and accordingly competition for retail space are expected to remain strong in 2012. Active monitoring of the preferences of consumers and management of the mix of tenants should encourage higher retail sales in the Group s malls.
Retail conditions in Mainland China are expected to remain strong in 2012 as the economy continues to rebalance and grow. Results from Sanlitun Village are expected to continue to improve in 2012, reflecting past and planned investment aimed at enhancing footfall and circulation. TaiKoo Hui and INDIGO, a 1.9 million square foot mixed-use development in Beijing, are expected to contribute to higher rental income in 2012, with TaiKoo Hui in its first full year of operations and the retail component at INDIGO starting to open in 
Profits from property trading are expected to be significant in 2012, with the completion of and sale of units in the AZURA development in Hong Kong. Prices of luxury residential properties in Hong Kong are expected to be steady, underpinned by low interest rates and limited supply.
The hotels in Hong Kong and Mainland China are expected to continue to perform well in 2012, benefiting from increased business and leisure travel as the economies of Mainland China and the rest of Asia continue to grow. The 263-room hotel (operated by Mandarin Oriental) at the TaiKoo Hui development is scheduled to open in the second half of 2012.
EAST Beijing, which is part of the INDIGO development, is also scheduled to open in the latter part of 2012.
After a record year in 2010, the Cathay Pacific group faced a number of major challenges in 2011. It continues to face challenges in 2012. Economic uncertainties have continued into the first part of this year. While these uncertainties continue, pressure on economy class yields is expected to continue and the cargo business in particular is expected to remain weak. Fuel prices have risen further. As a result, 2012 is looking even more challenging than 2011 and Cathay Pacific is therefore cautious about the prospects for this year. Cathay Pacific will continue to be vigilant in managing costs without compromising the quality of its products and services or the long-term strategic investment in its business. Its financial position remains strong.
Despite the uncertainty in the world s major economies, demand for HAECO s heavy and line maintenance services in Hong Kong and for TAECO s base maintenance services in Xiamen is expected to grow modestly in 2012. HAESL is also expected to perform well in 2012.
In the Beverages Division, the growth of the Mainland China economy (particularly of manufacturing exports) is expected to slow and may affect beverage sales in the southern and eastern provinces. Overall prospects for growth in beverage sales in Mainland China are nevertheless considered favourable. Taiwan is expected to recover from the difficult trading conditions of 2011 and Hong Kong has potential for growth. Results in 2012 in the USA are likely to be affected by the weakness of the economy and the difficulty of 
SPO s charter hire and utilisation rates are expected to improve in 2012 as exploration and production spending by oil companies increases. SPO s 2012 results will also reflect the full-year contribution of vessels delivered in 2011 and the delivery of the first D-class and wind farm installation vessels.
In the longer-term, diminishing reserves and increasing consumption of oil and gas are expected to lead to increased exploration by energy companies in deeper waters. At the same time, there is growing demand by national governments for local content in offshore supply vessel contracts. With the investments SPO is currently making in larger, more sophisticated vessels and in expanding its network of regional offices and joint ventures, SPO will be well positioned to face both of these developments.
The Trading & Industrial Division expects continued growth in sales for Swire Resources and Taikoo Motors in 2012, with the effect of this at Swire Resources likely to be offset by the costs of expanding its distribution network and the portfolio of brands which it distributes. Taikoo Sugar and Akzo Nobel Swire Paints expect strong growth in sales in Mainland China, but this is likely to be partially offset by high raw material costs and the costs associated with network expansion.

Net debt at 31st December 2011 was HK$35,679 million, compared with HK$41,181 million at 31st December 2010.
The decrease principally reflects the sale of Festival Walk, offset in part by investment in property projects in Mainland China and Hong Kong and in new vessels at SPO. Gearing decreased by 4.3 percentage points from 19.7% to 15.4%.
Cash and undrawn committed facilities totalled HK$20,339 million at 31st December 2011, compared with HK$16,323 million at 31st December 2010.

Sustainability is integral to Swire Pacific s long-term approach to business. We believe that when the communities in which we operate prosper, so do we. We wish to protect the environment we work in. Our ultimate goal is for our operating companies to achieve zero net impact on the environment. We support community projects with money, products and services and the time and energy of our staff.
We are an equal opportunities employer and offer our staff competitive remuneration and benefits. We strive to conduct our operations in a manner which safeguards the health and safety of our employees, those with whom we do business, our visitors and the communities in which we operate.
In 2011, we formed an energy committee and held a sustainable development forum. This helped us to identify opportunities for improving energy efficiency and generating carbon credits. Swire Beverages bottling plant in Zhengzhou achieved zero wastewater discharge in 2011. The new bottling plant at Luohe was awarded a Platinum LEED rating for its green design. Swire Properties has reduced the time in which it is trying to reduce its energy consumption by 20% from ten years to five. We are developing a reporting system designed to enable us to quantify the effect of our sustainability efforts on profits and to set targets. This reflects our recognition that sustainability can be profitable if properly managed and funded.
The commitment and hard work of employees of the Group and its jointly controlled and associated companies are central to our continuing success. I take this opportunity to
