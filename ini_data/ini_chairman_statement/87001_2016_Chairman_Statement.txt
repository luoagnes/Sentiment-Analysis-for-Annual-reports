Chairman s Statement 
H L KAM 
2015 was an eventful year for Hui Xian REIT: it marked the 15th anniversary of Beijing Oriental Plaza, Hui Xian REIT s fl agship asset; and the completion of acquisition of Chongqing Metropolitan Oriental Plaza.

2015 was a challenging year marked by a worldwide economic slowdown and increased international volatility.
Nonetheless, Hui Xian REIT kept the growth momentum amid global market turmoil during the year.
The amount available for distribution for the period from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2015 ( Reporting Period ) increased 8.4% year-on-year to RMB1,479 million. The increase was driven by the organic growth from the existing leasing and hotel portfolio, and the additional income contributed by the newly acquired Chongqing Metropolitan Oriental Plaza from 2 March 2015 to 31 December 2015.
RESULTS AND DISTRIBUTION Total revenue for the Reporting Period was RMB3,050 million, an increase of 9.1% year-on-year. Net property income ( NPI ) was RMB2,036 million, a rise of 9.9% from a year ago.
Gross asset value amounted to RMB46,704 million, a 10.6% growth compared to that as at 31 December 2014. Net asset value attributable to unitholders was RMB27,557 million compared with RMB28,564 million as at 31 December 
The amount available for distribution for the Reporting Period increased 8.4% year-on-year to RMB1,479 million. The distribution per unit ( DPU ) for the second half of the year was RMB0.1337. Together with the interim DPU, the total DPU for the year increased 5.2% year-on-year to RMB0.2700.
The distribution yield was 8.11% based on the closing unit price of RMB3.33 on 31 December 2015.
AN EVENTFUL YEAR 2015 was an eventful year for Hui Xian REIT: it marked the 15th anniversary of Beijing Oriental Plaza, Hui Xian REIT s fl agship asset; and the completion of acquisition of Chongqing Metropolitan Oriental Plaza.
Beijing Oriental Plaza Celebrated 15th Anniversary Since its opening in 2000, Beijing Oriental Plaza has established itself as the landmark of Beijing. Located in Wangfujing, the 800,000-square metre mixed-use development comprises a 130,000-square metre shopping centre, eight Grade A offi ces towers, two serviced apartment towers, and a fi ve-star hotel, Grand Hyatt Beijing. These four components are part and parcel to the success of the property complex, refl ecting the World within a World self- contained community concept.
In the past 15 years, Beijing Oriental Plaza has a track record of high occupancy rates and solid fi nancial position.
These achievements have laid a strong foundation, enabling Beijing Oriental Plaza to maintain growth momentum.

Acquisition of Chongqing Metropolitan Plaza On 2 March 2015, the acquisition of Chongqing Metropolitan Plaza was completed. Located in Jiefangbei s Central Business District, the 164,000-square metre mixed-use project has immediately contributed to Hui Xian REIT s revenue. It has been offi cially rebranded as Chongqing Metropolitan Oriental Plaza , the second project under Hui Xian REIT s Oriental Plaza brand.
Following the acquisition, areas under Hui Xian REIT s management have now increased to over one million square metres across three cities in China, namely Beijing, Chongqing and Shenyang.
RMB EXCHANGE RATE IN 2015 In 2015, RMB exchange rate saw signifi cant fl uctuation. The RMB exchange rate against Hong Kong Dollars dropped approximately 5.8%* compared to a year ago.
All of Hui Xian REIT s existing projects are located in China, generating revenue in RMB. Hui Xian REIT s fi nancial statements are presented in RMB and the distribution to Unitholders is also in RMB. RMB exchange rate volatility does not have a signifi cant impact on the performance of Hui Xian REIT s projects. However, Hui Xian REIT s current borrowings are in Hong Kong Dollars. The RMB exposure may appear when the exchange gain or loss is realised upon loan repayment.
Investment sentiment, nonetheless, could be adversely affected by RMB s exchange fl uctuation. According to Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the RMB deposits in Hong Kong as at the end of December 2015 shrank to approximately RMB851 billion, representing a drop of 15% compared to the amount as at the end of December 2014.
* Based on the People s Bank of China RMB rate against Hong Kong Dollars on 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2015.
BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN CHINA China s economy in 2015 grew at its slowest pace since 1990. Its full-year gross domestic product ( GDP ) increased 6.9% year-on-year, down from 7.3% in 2014, according to the National Bureau of Statistics of China. Industrial output grew 6.1% (versus an increase of 8.3% in 2014). Fixed-asset investment increased 10%, the weakest full-year growth 
The country s retail sales of consumer goods grew 10.7% year-on-year in 2015, slower than the 12% increase recorded in 2014. Online sales surged 33% year-on-year to RMB3.9 trillion.
At the macro level, China s luxury retail sector continued to face strong headwinds throughout 2015. The Central Government s anti-extravagance campaign continued. Meanwhile, popularity in online shopping and overseas shopping continued to grow.
Hit by slumping sales of luxury goods, some international brands consolidated their shop networks and closed down stores in some cities. Retailers have taken a more cautious approach towards store opening. This affected the occupancy rates and rental reversions of many shopping malls in China. Some landlords even turned retail premises into offi ce leasing space.

On the other hand, the rising income of the thriving middle class has become a major driver for domestic consumption, creating new opportunities for affordable luxury and mass market brands.

In spite of worldwide concerns about the Chinese economy, Hui Xian REIT s portfolio continued to deliver satisfactory results in 2015. Total revenue and NPI of Hui Xian REIT s portfolio during the Reporting Period increased 9.1% and 9.9% respectively compared to 2014.

To further enhance the retail offering, The Malls commenced a large-scale asset enhancement programme in the second half of 2015 for two zones, totaling 6,000 square metres of retail space.
