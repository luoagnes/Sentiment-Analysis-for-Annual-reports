REVIEW OF OPERATIONS The operations under Sino Land Company Limited ( Sino Land ) represent a substantial portion of the operations of the Group as a whole.

Sino Land s rental portfolio continue to perform well in the financial year ended 30th June, 2008. The gross rental revenue, including the attributable share of its associates, increased by 19.1% to HK$1,915.2 million compared with HK$1,607.3 million in the previous financial year.
The gross rental revenue sustained substantial increase during the year under review. The overall increase in rental revenue was a broad-based rental increase for lease renewals and the high occupancy maintained across all sectors are indeed encouraging. Newly added rental properties also contributed well including Citywalk in Tsuen Wan, as well as the acquisition of the remaining interests in the development companies of Olympian City 1 and 2 
Sino Land has also rolled out a series of asset enhancement programmes on a continuing basis with specific focus on design upgrades, effective marketing and promotional events, improvement in quality of service and right tenant mix.

Property redevelopment and use conversion on a continuing basis will enhance the value of the rental 
REVIEW OF OPERATIONS 
Rental Activities (Continued) During the financial year 20072008, Sino Land has also improved the tenant mix of One Fullerton where a number of award-winning and renowned food and beverage outlets recently opened. The building of One Fullerton, which is located across from The Fullerton Hotel Singapore, was renovated with enhanced waterfront landscape and promenade. The move paves the way to establishing an integrated commercial development named The Fullerton Heritage at the heart of Singapore s central business district and Marina Bay.
This development consists of The Fullerton Hotel Singapore, One Fullerton, The Fullerton Waterboat House, a 100-room luxurious boutique hotel named The Fullerton Bay Hotel, The Customs House and the Clifford Pier. The integrated development will offer a world-class waterfront entertainment and dining destination for tourists and locals.
This year, Sino Land organised a series of events in flagship shopping malls including Olympian City 2 and Tuen Mun Town Plaza to celebrate the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games. The Hong Kong Welcomes the Torch events on 2nd May, 2008 took place in both shopping malls and was well attended by the Chief Executive of the HKSAR, and by many celebrities and thousands of supporters.

Sino Land expects to complete a total of approximately 3.0 million square feet of attributable gross floor area of investment properties in the next few years which will further increase its recurrent income base.

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore The tourism industry in Singapore has experienced four consecutive calendar years of record growth since 2004. Visitor arrivals in Singapore grew by approximately 4.3% to 10.4 million in the 12-month period from July 2007 to June 2008, up from 9.9 million in the 12-month period from July 2006 to June 2007. The average length of stay has also increased to 3.89 days from 3.53 days over the same periods of comparison. Given that a good increase in business travel resulted from growing economic activity and business conferences, The Fullerton Hotel Singapore recorded favourable growth in average room rate whilst maintaining high occupancy level during the financial 
REVIEW OF OPERATIONS 
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (Continued) Singapore s tourism and hospitality industries are set for further growth in the medium to long term due to more and more tourism related infrastructure and upgraded developments. These include the new two-berth International Cruise Terminal at Marina South that will double its existing cruise ship capacity; the rejuvenation of Orchard Road and transformation of Marina Bay area into a world class city; and the revitalization of Singapore River into a 24-hour entertainment precinct. Major events such as the upcoming Formula 1 Grand Prix scheduled for 28th September, 2008 and the Youth Olympic Games in 2010 to be hosted in Singapore will also be positive for The Fullerton as it will enjoy high visibility and business.
The Fullerton places an emphasis on providing high quality products and services to the discerning guests. Management makes continuous efforts to strengthen the competitiveness of the hotel. During the financial year 2007 2008, Sino Land carried out renovations to upgrade its amenities and facilities.
The business centre in the lobby was converted to high-end retail space with all five retail outlets already leased out. A new business centre was established on the first floor. The new Post Bar outlet in Terminal 3 of Changi Airport has been operating since opening in January 2008 and offering customers its quality food and beverages as well as a range of signature cocktails in a relaxing and comfortable environment round the clock.

Conrad Hong Kong Visitor arrivals in Hong Kong remained strong increasing to 29.3 million for the 12-month period between 1st July, 2007 and 30th June, 2008, from 26.0 million for the previous 12-month period. While visitors from Mainland China continued to be the main contributor to the growth of the tourism industry in Hong Kong, visitors from other areas such as Europe, UK, Australia and South Korea were on the rise.
The HKSAR Government s efforts to continuously promote Hong Kong tourism industry by introducing various type of thematic travel attractions such as the 2008 Hong Kong Summer Temptations, Visa Million Dollar Lucky Draw , and weekend family travel for people living in Guangdong province are contributing factors to making Hong Kong a vibrant and interesting city for visitors. Establishing Hong Kong as a MICE (Meeting, Incentive, Convention, Exhibition) destination is conducive to increasing business travel. The award of Best MICE City given to Hong Kong by CEI Asia Pacific Magazine in January 2008 indicates that Hong Kong s conference support and quality of services have gained overseas recognition.

REVIEW OF OPERATIONS 
The global economy has been undergoing a period of adjustment since the end of 2007. In particular, sub-prime issues in the United States and inflationary pressure have caused a slowdown in the economic growth of the major economies. China, as one of the major trading partners of the United States and other major economies, has inevitably been affected. Coupled with Mainland China s own internal policy measures, there have been corrections in the property market. As a result, Sino Land has not acquired any sites for property development since August 2007.
However, Sino Land is positive about the economic prospects of Mainland China. The economic growth of China will continue despite some short-term adjustments. Given the Central Government s recent stance to implement measures to boost economic growth as their top policy agenda, this is positive to the development of property market on the Mainland over the medium to long term. Sino Land s commitment to building quality properties and providing after-sales professional property management services have been the key factors in achieving customer satisfaction and we are committed to doing the same for projects in Mainland China.
As at 30th June, 2008, Sino Land has a total of 27.4 million square feet of land bank in China, of which 26.8 million square feet are development land bank and the remaining are completed properties for investment and for sale 
Management would like to take this opportunity to express our heartfelt sympathy to those who suffered profound loss in the Sichuan earthquakes.
Sino Land s projects in Cheng Hua District of Chengdu and Jiang Bei District of Chongqing were not affected by the earthquakes and no damage has been reported as the sites were bare land at that time. The Central Government s programme to rebuild the affected areas will induce more investment demand nationwide associated with reconstruction and redevelopment activities.
Other than the matters mentioned above, there has been no material change from the information published in the report and accounts for the financial year ended 30th June, 2007.

As at 30th June, 2008, the Group s gearing ratio was at approximately 26.2%, expressed as a percentage of total borrowings to the total assets. The decrease in gearing compared with that as at 30th June, 2007 was mainly due to the receipts of the sales proceeds from the sales of residential units in Vision City, One SilverSea, houses in St. Andrews Place and receipts from sales of The Palazzo. Of the total borrowings, 29% was repayable within one year, 44% repayable between one and two years and 27% repayable between two and five years. The Group, including the attributable share of its associates, had cash resources of approximately HK$13,748.3 million, comprising cash on hand of approximately HK$4,726.0 million together with committed undrawn facilities of approximately HK$9,022.3 million. All the cash on hand is in the form of deposits in banks of high credit ratings.
There was no material change in foreign currency borrowings and the capital structure of the Group for the financial year ended 30th June, 2008. Foreign exchange exposure has been prudently kept at a minimal level. The Group s borrowings are subject to floating interest rates.

The Group places great significance on corporate integrity, business ethics and good governance. With the objective of achieving best practice of corporate governance, the Group has established an Audit Committee, a Compliance Committee and a Remuneration Committee. Sino Land is committed to maintaining good corporate transparency as well as good communication with investors and shareholders by various channels such as non-deal roadshows, investor conferences, results briefing, site visits and corporate website to disseminate information on the Sino Land s latest 
Sino Land reaffirms its commitment to building quality projects. In keeping with its mission to enhance customer satisfaction, the Group will wherever possible ensure that attractive design concepts and features, which are also environmentally friendly, are integral elements of its developments.
Management continues to conduct regular reviews of its properties and where necessary makes improvements to maintain its reputation for the highest standards of quality and service.
Delivering high-quality customer service has long been one of the Sino Land s key business objectives. During the period under review, Sino Property Services received a number of awards from HKSAR Government and renowned organisations in recognition of its quality of service, management capability, contributions in community and charity services, and promotion of environmental protection. Sino Land will continue to make improvement in its quality of service so as to ensure customer satisfaction and enhance 
To further the Group s commitment to good corporate citizenship, the Community Care Committee (the Committee ) works closely with different charitable and voluntary organisations to arrange various community services for the needy.
On the environmental protection side, the Group has collaborated with a number of international organisations from promoting environmental protection to co-organising activities to inspire public interest in protecting our natural resources and encourage the concept of green living.
It is also the Group s belief that supporting local arts and cultural activities is important to foster creativity, reinforce public awareness and fulfill Hong Kong people s artistic appreciation. The Committee will continue to roll out activities for staff participation as well as to serve the community in the years 
The financial year 20072008 was indeed a challenging year. The impact of the price inflation of commodities has spread out to a range of industries.
The consolidation of the US economy triggered by sub-prime issues, the housing market, a tightening of credit in financial markets and the problems in mortgage backed securities have affected the world economic growth in general. However, government authorities have responded in a timely manner with appropriate and decisive fiscal and monetary stimulus and other measures to foster confidence and to promote a return of the economy to a sustained 
Although there has been volatility in equity markets, continuous economic growth in Mainland China, infrastructure developments both within Hong Kong and in Pearl River Delta Region as well as Hong Kong s own economic fundamentals continued to drive the economic growth of Hong Kong. On the other hand, the challenging global economic climate has recently caused consolidation in residential property prices this year but such consolidation is considered a short-term adjustment within a long-term growth cycle. A short term adjustment in the residential property market will bring in a healthy and sustainable growth in the medium to long run.
Notwithstanding the present global economic environment, the underlying macro economic environment in Hong Kong remains fundamentally sound with economic growth at a reasonably favourable level, the unemployment rate staying low and vibrant trade flows between Hong Kong and Mainland China. Furthermore, the negative real interest rate environment, a broad- based increase in payrolls partly balancing out inflation, mortgage rates at comparatively low levels, improvement in home purchase affordability are all positive indicators for the property market to grow in Hong Kong.

The budget of the HKSAR Government for the fiscal year 200809 proposing a series of incentives focusing on the reduction of certain tax rates is conducive to alleviating the burden of tax-payers. Investment in infrastructure developments including the new railway links of the West Island Line, the South Island Line and confirmation of the Shatin to Central Link as well as the upgrading programme for the Hong Kong International Airport are positives for the Hong Kong economy and property market. Further, the proposed Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge will further enhance economic links among these cities and to other Mainland cities which will certainly benefit Hong Kong s economy. As the majority of the Group s assets are in Hong Kong, the Group is well positioned to gain from positive economic and property market 
China, Asia s second largest economy, has shown signs of stabilising with inflation gradually contained as government measures have taken effect.
Central Government has also indicated that the national economy under macroeconomic control measures is continuing to develop in their expected direction. There have been signs that maintaining economic growth is on top of the Central Government s economic policy agenda. Prospects for the China s economy are good over the medium to long term.
The Group continues to be prudently positioned to benefit from opportunities that will arise in the future and will strive to optimise earnings, improve the quality of its properties and services, and enhance customers lifestyles. The Group will maintain a policy of selectively and continuously replenishing its land bank both in Hong Kong and China, which will enable it to strengthen earnings and profitability, and continue to deliver shareholder value. The Directors are indeed confident in the medium to long term prospects of the 
STAFF AND MANAGEMENT On behalf of the Board, I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation to all staff for their commitment, dedication and continuing support. I would also like to express my gratitude to my fellow Directors for their guidance and wise counsel.
