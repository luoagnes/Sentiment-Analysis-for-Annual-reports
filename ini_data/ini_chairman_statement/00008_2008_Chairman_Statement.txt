STATEMENT FROM THE CHAIRMAN
PCCW’s reputation for
innovation and quality
bolstered our
competitiveness in the
world arena, enabling us to
win more business
overseas
The PCCW team has worked diligently to build on our unique
quadruple-play capability, following launch in 2006. The
result of last year’s efforts was a succession of infotainment,
connectivity and transactional services across our fixed-line,
mobile, broadband Internet and TV platforms to enrich digital
lifestyles.
At the same time, buoyant economic conditions created
positive business sentiment, prompting further investment in
Information & Communications Technologies (ICT) as a potent
response to commercial growth and demand on government
infrastructure. This generated promising business
opportunities for the Company, both regionally and locally.
PCCW’s reputation for innovation and quality also bolstered
our competitiveness in the world arena, enabling the
Company to win more business overseas by making our core
expertise available on commercial terms.
Success in consumer and business markets in 2007 gave rise
to a robust financial and operating performance, adding
momentum to our pursuit of innovation and quality – to the
benefit of PCCW’s growing community of customers locally
and abroad.
The Company has performed well as a world-class ICT
player – and I wish to thank the management team and staff
for building a stronger PCCW Group to address the challenges
of the future.
