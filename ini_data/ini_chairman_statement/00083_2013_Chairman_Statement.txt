20122013 marked a smooth transition of leadership in China and the new Central Government officials were appointed under the National People s Congress in March 2013. The economic and financial reforms shall continue to maintain stability of the country and steer China s economy to grow on a 
Following an era of high growth in the past few decades, policymakers in China have set out the roadmap of economic and financial reforms that cover various economic and financial issues including public finance, capital markets, policy enforcement and operational standards within the government. These reforms will optimise resources allocation, minimise economic disparity among cities and regions, improve distribution of income, strengthen the financial sector which in turn will transform the country into a more consumption-led economy. Efforts have also been made to ensure that such growth is steady and at the same time, address issues such as environmental concerns.

Another key government policy focus is to manage the process of urbanisation. Urbanisation is a long-term process and has been progressing alongside with the development of land, housing, town planning, infrastructure, transportation, education, social service, security and environmental protection. Increasing population in cities and revitalization of local communities offer tremendous business opportunity not only for properties, but also for a wide range of industries.

Sino Land Company Limited Annual Report 2013 CHAIRMAN S STATEMENT (Continued) 
prospects Global economic environment remains uncertain despite some positive economic signs of financial stability in certain advanced economies. With world economic growth likely to continue to be weak, management expects there to be challenges in the short and medium term.

The United States economic data have shown that both domestic economy and the financial sector have been improving. Labour market has shown signs of recovery and household spending has advanced. Market has reacted somewhat positively with a view that economic activity is likely to pick up gradually. As stated in the meeting statements of the Federal Open Market Committee, it will maintain an accommodative monetary policy with federal funds rate being kept at low level until there are sustainable evidences of economic recovery.

In the Euro zone, the inauguration of the European Stability Mechanism in 2012 and the concerted policy actions at national and European levels to tackle the crisis have improved the financial conditions and restored confidence in the region.
Although the economic growth is expected to strengthen gradually over time as policymakers continue to introduce policies to address the structural weaknesses and challenges, there may still be volatility going forward.

As for China, the Central Government continues its economic reforms for the purpose of building a more resilient, healthier and balanced economy and society.
The reforms are important from the perspectives of urban development, income distribution and resources allocation. Not only do they improve people s standard of living, but also help tackle challenges arising from the domestic economy and changes in global economic environment. The meeting convened by the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee held in July this year reaffirmed the direction of Central Government s policy stance on economic growth and reforms, and has sent a positive signal to the market for a more sustainable economic and property market outlook.

The Hong Kong property market has been going through a period of change as a result of economic and property-related policies. The Group is mindful of the upcoming uncertainties in a challenging market and management will be responsive to market changes. The Group s recurrent businesses, namely rental, hospitality and property management services continue to be resilient. With a good financial position, the Group is well-positioned to face challenges ahead.
As there will be more land for private housing development, the Group will also benefit from this opportunity and will continue to acquire land with good development value at the appropriate time.

Management will continue to optimise earnings, enhance efficiency and productivity and improve the quality of products and services. In respect of property development and property management, the Group will incorporate more environmentally friendly elements in our projects. The Group will maintain a policy of selectively and continuously replenishing its land bank, which will enable it to strengthen earnings and shareholders value.
