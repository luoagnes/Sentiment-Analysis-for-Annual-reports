Chairman s Statement In the second half of 2008, economic conditions continued to deteriorate, both in Hong Kong and globally. Whilst growth in Mainland China remained positive, there were signs of a slowdown, particularly in the export sector, despite the announcement of a substantial stimulus package. Similarly, in Macau, the economy has slowed significantly after several years of above trend growth.
Conditions in the banking sector globally have remained extremely difficult, with bailouts of a number of major global financial institutions having taken place.
Against this backdrop, with the increasingly likely outcome of the first global recession for many years, our results for the full year 2008 were disappointing, with profit attributable to shareholders falling by 90% to HK$106 million.
Profit before impairment charges was down by 35% to HK$1,467 million, due mainly to much weaker fee and commission income in our banking business. Our profit for the year was significantly affected by the mark-to-market losses on our insurance investment portfolio, and a substantial increase in overall impairment charges on loans and securities investments over the previous year.
During the year, we were pleased to complete the acquisition of a further 3% in Bank of Chongqing, bringing our total shareholding to 20%. However, as the transaction was completed in October 2008, we only recorded the additional contribution to our results for a period of just over two months during the year.
In March 2008, we announced that our long term strategic shareholders, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., a subsidiary of The Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group ( MUFG ), increased its shareholding in the Group to 15%, raising proceeds of approximately HK$471 million. MUFG and Dah Sing have been working together with a view to a closer relationship in key areas of 
Our separately listed banking subsidiary, DSBG, reported a decrease in profits for the year, with profit attributable to shareholders of HK$189 million, a decrease of 76% compared with the previous year. Whilst net interest income remained robust, growing by around 7%, fee income was weak, principally due to reduced activity in the wealth management business.
However, the major reason for the substantial reduction in profit was due to sharp increases in impairment charges on loans, as well as continued high impairment charges on securities investment. In aggregate, impairment charges for loans and securities totalled HK$1,314 million, an increase of 8% compared with the previous 
Lending volumes remained relatively flat. Whilst loan demand weakened considerably in the second half of the year, we were able to continue business to support our customers as appropriate, with the result that aggregate loan volumes for the year were similar to 2007. Despite the difficult market environment, our customer deposits grew 4% year on year.
Dah Sing Bank s wholly owned and locally incorporated subsidiary bank in China, Dah Sing Bank (China) Limited, commenced business on 1 August 2008. This subsidiary bank is headquartered in Shenzhen, with a sub-branch in Shenzhen and a branch in

Whilst the efforts to grow our insurance business in recent years were still able to generate an increase in total premium and other insurance income of around 12% for the year, this represents a significant slowdown from the growth rates over the previous two years of more than 30% per year.
The major reason for the decline in the insurance performance for the year was the negative mark-to-market to the income statement of insurance investments. However, it is of note that whilst the insurance investment performance was negative, it was still able to outperform market benchmarks in one of the most difficult years for investment on record.
Board of Directors During the year, Mr. Keisuke Tahara ceased to serve as an alternate director to Mr. Tatsuo Tanaka and Mr. Tetsuya Wada was appointed in his place. Mr. Keisuke Tahara remains a non-executive director 
Mr. Chung-Kai Chow, the Vice Chairman and a non-executive Director of the Company, will not seek for re-election upon retirement by rotation at the forthcoming annual general meeting to be held on 1 June 2009 after 22 years of directorship in the Group. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude for his invaluable contribution to the Group especially for his guidance and wise counsel all these 
Recent economic data has indicated that the current economic downturn is likely to be one of the most severe in recent years.
Whilst the Mainland China economy continues to record healthy rates of growth, and the stimulus measures announced recently are expected to be supportive of the economy, it would not be prudent to expect that this will overcome the more general global economic 
Therefore, our strategy into 2009 will be one of caution. However, we must also be mindful that in times of adversity there are often opportunities, and that in the medium to longer term we expect that our market presence in Hong Kong, Mainland and Macau, and the continued long term prospects for the China market will enable us to continue to grow our business in future years.
Finally, I would like to thank my fellow directors for their valuable contribution and extend on behalf of the Board, our appreciation to all our colleagues for their hard work and dedication over the past year, and also our appreciation of the support of our customers.
