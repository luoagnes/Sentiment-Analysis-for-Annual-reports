CHAIRMAN S STATEMENT On behalf of the Board, I wish to present the Annual Report of Shangri-La Asia Limited for the financial year ended 31 December 2013.
The global economy has been showing signs of a slow, albeit, inconsistent recovery through 2013. However, the luxury segment of the hotel industry is facing challenging times in Mainland China. The situation has been exacerbated by the emergence of new competitive supply in several cities already afflicted by weak demand. Consequently, consolidated revenues grew marginally by 1.16% over 2012 to US$2.081 billion.
Despite efforts to contain operating costs, the EBITDA for the year was US$571.8 million compared to US$608.2 million in 2012. The prevailing competitive environment is expected to continue to exert pressure on the Group s operating profits 
Profits after tax from the hotel property folio continues to be adversely impacted by the start-up costs of newly opened hotels, pre-opening costs of hotels under development, higher depreciation and amortization costs from newly opened hotels and increase in interest costs attributable to a growing loan portfolio.
Profits after tax from the Group s investment properties portfolio amounted to US$97.3 million which represented an increase of 19.4% over 2012. Occupancies and rental yields continued to be generally robust through 2013.
Profits attributable to shareholders of US$392.3 million (2012: US$359.0 million) included revaluation gains on investment properties of US$398.7 million (2012: 
Earnings per share amounted to US12.57 cents per share (2012: US11.50 cents per 
A final dividend of HK4 cents per ordinary share has been proposed, which when added to the interim dividend of HK8 cents per ordinary share, will amount to a total dividend of HK12 cents per ordinary share for the financial year 2013.
During the year, the Group opened three new hotels in Mainland China, one in Istanbul, Turkey and one hotel under management contract in Malaysia. It also disposed its interest in an operating hotel in Mainland China at a profit and terminated its management contract with the Shangri-La Hotel, Mumbai, India.
As at the end of 2013, the Group s hotel portfolio consisted of 63 hotels that it owned leased and operated and 19 hotels that it operated for third party owners. It also had 22 new hotel projects under development of which 13 projects are in Mainland China and has on hand management contracts for 5 hotels which are being developed by third 
I would like to acknowledge the dedication and hard work of the management and staff member of each and every hotel and the management and marketing network of the Group. I would also like to thank my fellow Directors for their support and guidance.
