Dear Shareholders,
On behalf of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) and the management of China Yongda Automobiles Services

of 14.9% as compared to the same period in 2015, among which, the sales volume of luxury brand vehicles

retail prices have moderately improved, inventories of dealers have reduced, the passenger vehicles market in
China gradually achieved a sustainable and sound growth. Vehicle ownership in China reached 194 million units by

The Group considers that China’s luxury brand vehicles sales and services industry has since the end of
2015 gradually stepped out of a period of market adjustment over the past few years, and its physical
channels with 4S dealerships as the key form continues to demonstrate greater vitality after years of
tempering by the market annealing. We continue to keep an optimistic judgment upon the development of
the sales and after-sales market in the passenger vehicle industry. The Group plans to focus on the following
aspects in our future development:
1. We will adhere to our refi ned business management tradition, and enhance the management of all
aspects of our main businesses such as sales and after-sales services;

automobile fi nance, pre-owned vehicle business and automobile rental services, in order to achieve

the main brands including BMW, Porsche and Audi, and to actively capture high-quality merger and

quality of the customer service level of the Group. Besides, we will strive to build an integrated online

vertical e-commerce businesses, fi nancial institutions, insurance companies and leasing platforms, so
as to achieve powerful alliances and mutual complementarity;

Group’s sustainable development.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to express our sincere gratitude to all of the staff for their efforts and to
