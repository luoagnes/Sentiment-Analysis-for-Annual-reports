STATEMENT FROM THE CHAIRMAN
After a long period of economic growth in Hong Kong,
we are now operating in an environment made difficult
by the global financial turmoil and the prospect of a
prolonged international recession.
Since the last quarter of 2008 we have witnessed a
marked slowdown in market activities, which exert
considerable pressure on our businesses. Without any
signs of the economy reversing the present downward
trend, operators in Hong Kong’s highly competitive
telecommunications market are expected to be under
continuous challenges in the year ahead.
Fortunately, we enter this period of uncertainty with a
degree of financial and operational strength, as well as a
distinctly strong brand, thanks to the efforts of a skilled
and talented team that has produced a succession of
innovative services for our customers in both the private
and public sectors in Hong Kong and overseas.
Furthermore, I am pleased to report that we completed
a corporate restructuring last year. The Group’s
operational efficiencies will improve as a result of this
restructuring, which has grouped our telecoms services,
media and IT solutions businesses under a new
company, HKT Group Holdings Limited.
PCCW is Hong Kong’s premier telecommunications
provider. Going forward, we will continue to work hard
to consolidate our leadership position in the industry
via enhanced innovation and service quality, and with
optimization of operating and capital expenditures. To
achieve these goals, all staff must work together with
determination to continue to provide our customers with
PCCW’s high quality products and services.
These are challenging times, and we look forward to the
unwavering support of our shareholders and customers.
