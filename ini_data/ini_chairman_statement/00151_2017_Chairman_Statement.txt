Chairman’s Statement 
Dear Shareholders,
As mentioned in the Chairman’s Statement of the 2015 annual report,
throughout more than 40 years of my career in Want Want, whenever I faced
challenges and whenever the business encountered bottlenecks, I would
calm down to ponder every single word of the “Company Motto”. I had been
inspired by the Motto in different ways over the years and under different
circumstances. Nevertheless, “innovation for changes” has always been
the theme. It is the “start from oneself” Want Want spirit that has casted our
corporate culture of being fearless in embracing changes and brave in our
progress.
In 2016, since the performance of some products were affected by the
industry and weather conditions, the Group’s revenue decreased by 7.9%
year on year to RMB19,710.1 million. However, gross profit margin increased
by 3.9 percentage points to 47.8% as compared with that of 2015 due to the
decrease in cost of some raw materials. The operating expenses were well
controlled, which decreased by 4.4% to RMB5,128.7 million as compared
with that of 2015. Net profit attributable to equity holders of the Company
increased by 4.0% to RMB3,519.2 million as compared with that of 2015
with a net profit margin of 17.9%. Earnings before interest, income tax,
depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) grew 6.0% to RMB5,727.5 million
over that of 2015.
Building on our business in 2015, we continued in 2016 to focus on modern
channel, e-commerce and maternity channels and launched customized
and personalized products for these channels respectively. This strategy
was widely supported by both our customers and consumers, spurring a
prominent growth in these three channels. In addition, we made use of our
existing production capacity for introducing new products under different
brands such as “Yappy”, “Mr. Hot” and “Aiyo”, which, to a large extent, helped
to expand our existing consumer base and enhance our overall product
presence on shelves in stores. We will continue to adhere to such strategy,
enhance our brands’ visibility and consumer coverage, and conduct various
interactive activities with consumers with the objective of raising consumer
awareness and recognition of Want Want’s brands. Moreover, we will further
enhance our market and product penetration through our “Delivering Want
Want Products to Villages Project” so as to take full advantages of product
diversification. I believe that going through a journey of steady progress is the
only way to success irrespective of the changes in market or environment.DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES:
The Board recommended the payment of a final dividend of US1.19 cents
per share for the year of 2016, which is approximately US$148 million in
total. Including the interim dividend of US$73.61 million, the total amount of
dividends for the year of 2016 would be approximately US$222 million.
In 2016, to increase shareholders’ value, the Company, by way of share
repurchases funded by its free cash flow, repurchased 330 million shares
of the Company in the open market at a total consideration of HK$1,635.2
million. When aggregating the 342 million shares repurchased in 2015, the
total numbers of shares repurchased in the open market within these two
years were 672 million shares, and at a total consideration of HK$3,889.8
million. The shares repurchased were subsequently cancelled. As a result,
the number of issued shares of the Company as at 31 December 2016
decreased to 12,524 million with an earning per share of RMB27.7 cents,
representing a growth of 7.3% as compared with that of 2015.
Since the listing of the Company in 2008, most of the Group’s free cash
flow had been returned to our shareholders by ways of dividends and
share repurchases. By the end of 2016, the Group has returned a total of
US$3,137.2 million (excluding the proposed final dividend for the year 2016)
to our shareholders by these two means.
I believe that China’s food industry landscape will see a structural reform
in the coming two to three years. “Competition leads to progress” is what
we have learnt from the history and I believe there will be plenty of golden
opportunities amid all the difficulties and challenges, which are only
for someone who is well-prepared in advance. I require all Want Want
management to be accountable and responsible for their work, because we
bear the dreams of all Want Want staff and the hope of over 50,000 families.
2017 is the year of Rooster, which gives us prosperity, passion and power to
strive together for a better future for Want Want.
