Letter from the Board
On behalf of the board of directors (the “Board”) (the “Directors”)
of First Natural Foods Holdings Limited (the “Company”), I am
pleased to report on the financial results and operations of the
Company and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) for the year ended 31
December 2013.
FINANCIAL REVIEW
The Group achieved a turnover of approximately HK$544,824,000
for the year ended 31 December 2013, decreased by approximately
HK$106,738,000 or 16.4% as compared to that of last year while loss
attributable to the owners of the Company for the year ended 31
December 2013 was approximately HK$14,953,000 as compared to
a profit of approximately HK$382,858,000 in 2012. The loss was due
to the combined effects of (i) the absence of non-recurring gain on
debts discharged amounting to approximately HK$381,258,000
which was recorded in the year ended 31 December 2012; and (ii)
the decline in revenue and profit margin of food products
processing and trading business for the year ended 31 December
2013. The loss from operations for the year ended 31 December
2013 was approximately HK$14,951,000 as compared to a profit
from operations of approximately HK$19,412,000 in 2012. The
management discussion and analysis following this letter from the
Board provides a detailed review of operations of the year as well
as the business outlook of the Group.
