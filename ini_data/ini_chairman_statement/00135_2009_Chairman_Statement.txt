CHAIRMAN S STATEMENT 
I am pleased to announce to the shareholders on behalf of the Board that, for the year ended 31 December 2008 (the Year ), the Group recorded profit attributable to equity holders of the Company of HK$3,319,132,000, representing an increase of HK$1,355,692,000 or 69.05% compared with HK$1,963,440,000 (restated) in the previous year.

The sales volume of crude oil for the Year was 16,494,000 barrels (2007: 16,488,000 barrels), representing an increase of 6,000 barrels or 0.04% compared with the previous year. In addition, with the rise in international crude oil price, profit before taxation of the Group increased by HK$2,243,627,000. As compared with the previous year, the weighted average realised crude oil price per barrel of the Group was approximately US$78.26, representing an increase of US$19.20 or 32.52% as compared with US$59.06 in the previous year.

On 27 August 2008, the Company was informed by PetroChina Company Limited ( PetroChina ) that PetroChina would become the controlling shareholder of the Group. Upon completion of the shareholding restructure, the Group will continue to engage in its current oil and gas exploration and development business, and will exploit new business growth opportunities in city gas, vehicle fuel gas and related businesses with the support of PetroChina. After receiving the information, the Group promptly accelerated the search for relevant natural gas projects to be injected into the Group.

In previous accounting years, the Group adopted the purchase method of accounting, to account for acquisition of subsidiaries, including the business combinations under common control. Following the acquisition by PetroChina on 18 December 2008, the Directors of the Company are of the view that, taking into account of the policy adopted by PetroChina and certain companies within the industry, the predecessor value method of accounting would provide more appropriate and relevant information of the Group s business combinations under common control in the Group s consolidated financial statements. Therefore, with effect from 1 January 2008, the Group changed to adopt predecessor value method of accounting to account for its business combinations under common control.

The Group has eleven oilfields located in seven different countries, four of them are exploration projects. In 2008, each oil field underwent comprehensive exploration and development, seeking to increase reserves and production volume in light of high oil price, so as to generate considerable returns for shareholders.

The Group planned to complete the drilling work of four exploration wells during the exploration period (which was ended on 4 December 2007) so as to confirm the oil reserves and apply for development.

After the official take-over in October 2006, the Group immediately arranged the drilling and exploration works. In 2007, four exploration wells were drilled, although there was indication of different level of oil trail, the data was not sufficient to apply for entering the development phase. The petroleum contract has a term of thirty years, but the exploration phase has a term of only ten years which ended on 4 December 2007. After the drilling of the four exploration wells, the exploration phase expired before the comprehensive exploration works commenced, and all activities were subsequently suspended. The Group has applied in writing to the Petroleum Department of Indonesia (BP Migas) to extend the term for exploration. After relentless explanations and persuasion made to the Petroleum Department of Indonesia by the management of CGB II, eventually in February 2009, the Petroleum Department agreed to extend the exploration phase to December 2011. Therefore, 2009 will be a crucial year to CGB II.
