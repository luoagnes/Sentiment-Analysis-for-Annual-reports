Loss attributable to equity holders of the parent for the Year (from continuing and discontinued operations) was HK$1,494.4 million as compared to profit of HK$8,195.8 million for the same period last year.

DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASE The Board of Directors of the Company (the Board ) has recommended the payment of final dividend of HK1 cent per share for the Year (the Final Dividend ) (2007: HK22.5 cents). During the Year, the Group has realised all its listed securities investments. Out of the core profit HK$4,448.8 million (2007: HK$2,732.1 million), a profit of HK$3,690.5 million (2007: HK$1,200.0 million) was generated by the listed securities investment activities. With such results, the Board has recommended the payment of a special dividend of HK99 cents per share for the Year (the Special Dividend ) (2007: nil), amounting to HK$2,033.8 million (2007: nil), which are summarised on next page.
In addition to the Special Dividend, during the Year, the Company has allocated an aggregate cash amount of HK$4,648.4 million (2007: HK$825.5 million) (or HK216.2 cents per share (2007: HK36.0 cents)) which would be paid to shareholders. Out of such sum, an amount of HK$306.2 million (2007: HK$308.4 million) (or HK13.5 cents per share (2007: HK13.5 cents)) has been applied for the payment of interim dividend; an amount of HK$20.5 million (2007: HK$517.1 million) (or HK1 cent per share (2007: HK22.5 cents)) would be applied for the payment of Final Dividend; and an amount of HK$2,287.9 million (2007: nil) (or HK102.7 cents) has been utilised for the repurchase of the Company s shares.
The aggregate of interim dividend, Final Dividend, Special Dividend and share repurchase are summarised as follows: DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASE (cont d) 
In its decision of recommending the Final Dividend and Special Dividend, the Board has taken into consideration the following factors: (1) The profit on listed securities investments was arose from disposal of the entire portfolio of listed securities investment during the Year.
After such disposal, there is no intention to invest in listed securities in a similar level as in 2008 in the near future.
(2) Cash and bank balances of the Group amounted to HK$10,419 million as at 31st December, 2008. A significant portion of such balance was derived from the disposal of the entire portfolio of listed securities investment during the Year referred to above.
(3) Following the financial tsunami since late 2008, the economic condition and operating environment have deteriorated. Rental for 2009 is expected to decrease and properties are likely to be sold at a low price.
(4) The current difficult economic condition and operating environment would have an adverse impact on the Group s business activities and thus on its ability to pay dividend.
(5) The prevailing Hong Kong dollar interest spread for placing deposit and bank borrowing has widen by 200 to 250 basis point or 2% to 2.5% per annum as compared with the market spread in the first half 2008, which implies a higher cost of negative carry in holding cash and bank balances by the Group.
(6) The Group has outstanding bank borrowings of HK$11,669 million and contingent liabilities in respect of bank borrowings by its associated companies of HK$1,080 million as at 31st December, 2008. Following the financial tsunami since late 2008, a number of foreign banks have withdrew their participation in Hong Kong loan lending market while some local banks have reduced the size of their loan books. The loan syndication market in Hong Kong is weak.
In general, refinancing bank borrowings would be a challenge to many corporations in 2009.
(7) If the Final Dividend and Special Dividend are approved by the shareholders and payment made, the cash and bank balances of the Group will be reduced by such amount. In the event that the Group encounters difficulties refinancing its bank borrowings in the years ahead, the Company could at that time raise fund through equity issue including seeking the support from its shareholders by way of rights issue.
