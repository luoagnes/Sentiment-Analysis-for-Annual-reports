Overall revenue of the Hotels division increased by 18.1% from HK$3,269.4 million in 2010 to HK$3,862 million in 2011, driven predominately by higher room rates. The performance at the majority of our overseas hotels has been adversely affected by a slowing of the world economies following the outbreak of the Euro debt crisis in the third quarter of 2011. The slowdown in business travel also had an impact on the Hong Kong hotels, but fortunately the surge in demand from Mainland leisure travelers mitigated the effect of the slowdown. Overall, EBITDA of the Hotels division rose 53.9% from HK$659.6 million in 2010 to HK$1,015.4 million in 2011. (Note: in 2010, a one-off re-branding expense was booked, which lowered the base for 
The biggest revenue contributors to the Hotels division were the three hotels in Hong Kong, which generated HK$1,481.7 million in revenue (2010: HK$1,260.3 million). Notwithstanding the deterioration in global economic conditions since the second quarter of 2011 which put a drag on international business travel, Hong Kong benefitted from rising arrivals from Mainland China and Southeast Asia countries (Mainland China accounted for approximately 30% of the guests at our Hong Kong hotels in 2011). With occupancy in the Hong Kong market hovering at very high levels throughout the year, pricing power was in the hands of hoteliers. As a result the overall room rates achieved at our three hotels rose by 20% for the year. That in turn led to a 36.4% growth in EBITDA to HK$562.7 million in 2011. The Hong Kong hotels accounted for 38.4% of revenue but 55.5% of EBITDA of the global hotel portfolio in 2011.
The Langham, Hong Kong Thanks to its location in the prime shopping area of Tsimshatsui, coupled with high-profile promotion of the Langham brand in Mainland China, Langham Hong Kong enjoyed a high growth in tourist arrivals from Mainland China in 2011. Increased arrivals from other parts of the Asia-Pacific region also helped the hotel to maintain a high average occupancy of 81% for 2011 (2010: 80%). Therefore despite growing macro uncertainties since the third quarter, the Hotel was able to continue with its strategy of maximising room rates. As a result it delivered a 20% year-on-year growth in average room rate to HK$2,128 in 2011 
Revenue from food and beverage rose 14% year-on- year in 2011, driven by higher demand for catering services and an increased number of high spending guests at its signature restaurants.
Langham Place, Hong Kong The higher average occupancy of 87% achieved in 2011 (2010: 85%) was primarily due to an increase in both corporate and leisure travellers from Southeast Asia and Mainland China. In particular, room nights sold to arrivals from Mainland China rose by 32% year-on-year in 2011. In view of the strong demand, the Hotel was able to raise its average room rates by 20% from HK$1,487 in 2010 to HK$1,788 in 2011.
Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR) as a result increased by 24% year-on-year.
Revenue from food and beverage rose 13% year- on-year in 2011. It was supported by increased catering business from corporate functions and strong business at the Michelin rated two-star Chinese

Turning around from a 3 percentage-point decline in occupancy achieved in the first half of 2011, when the Hotel was focusing on increasing its market share, average occupancy actually rose by 1 percentage point to 88% for the full year in 2011. That was a reflection of the strong demand for mid-priced rooms in the second half of 2011. That in turn led a 20% increase in average room rates from HK$900 in 2010 to HK$1,079 for the full year.
Revenue from food and beverage was softer in 2011, in the face of keen competition for wedding banquet business from other restaurants in the area, though that was partially offset by better performance at the newly renovated bar and restaurant.

The Langham, London The Langham Hotel London increased its revenue by 24.2% in 2011 to HK$519.3 million on improved room rates, as compared to the relatively low base of HK$418 million in 2010, when the Hotel just completed a major renovation. This Hotel accounted for 13.4% of the Division s total revenue in 2011. Due to operating leverage, EBITDA increased 45.8% from HK$108.5 million in 2010 to HK$158.2 million in 2011.
The momentum of the full re-opening of the London hotel after refurbishment carried through to the first half of 2011 as it gained market share and built revenues.
However the Euro-zone crisis began to impact business in the second half of the year. Nonetheless, the Hotel has solidified its position as one of the top hotels in Central London. With a focus on high-yield retail and Middle Eastern markets, occupancy reached 78% on an average of 378 available rooms in 2011, compared with occupancy of 75% on an average of 350 available rooms in 2010. It was also able to raise its average room rates by 7.5% from 252 in 2010 to 271 in 2011. Revenue from food and beverage also recorded a modest growth of 13% in 2011.

The two hotels in Australia and New Zealand contributed HK$701.1 million in revenue or 18.2% of the Division s total revenue in 2011. Compared to the revenue of HK$558.9 million of 2010, the growth rate was 25.4%, mainly due to the strong performance of Langham Auckland, which benefitted from the Rugby 
The Langham, Melbourne Global economic slowdown in the third quarter of 2011 adversely affected the Melbourne hotel s performance, resulting in marginal growth in total revenue for the year. Softer demand from the corporate segment was compensated by an increase in weekend leisure business, which helped to lift average room rates by 6% to A$266 in 2011 (2010: A$252). During 2011, the refurbishment of 117 rooms was completed, enhancing the competitive position of the Hotel. In 2011, an occupancy of 78% on an average of 370 available rooms was achieved (2010: 80% on an average of 372 rooms). Revenue from food and beverage was stable in 2011, with increased revenue at the restaurants offsetting the sluggish demand for corporate catering services.
The Langham, Auckland Business of the Hotel was supported by an increase in retail, meetings and conference business over the first half of 2011 under stable economic conditions.
Performance of the second half was significantly lifted by the hosting of the Rugby World Cup 2011 in Auckland in September and October. While average occupancy went up only moderately to 69% in 2011 (2010: 66%), average room rate achieved jumped 30% to NZ$226 in 2011 (2010: NZ$174).
Revenue from food and beverage increased 36% year-on-year in 2011, and was driven primarily by the newly renovated restaurant and full year revenue contribution from the banquet facility, which became fully operational from March 2010.

The three hotels in North America produced HK$1,136.7 million or 29.4% of the Division s revenue in 2011. Compared to the $1,020.5 million in 2010, the growth rate was a modest 11.4%, due to better performance of Langham Pasadena and Delta Chelsea Toronto. As the Langham Pasadena was a turn- around situation in 2011, the EBITDA contribution of North America as a whole almost tripled from HK$36.7 million in 2010 to HK$117.2 million. Nevertheless, the North America market continued to underperform the rest of the portfolio.
The Langham, Boston Despite a difficult operating environment in 2011, revenue managed to edge up 3% in 2011, mainly due to a stronger performance in the first half, when there was some rebound in corporate activities. However food and beverage and other revenues declined. For the year 2011, the hotel achieved average occupancy of 69% (2010: 68%) and an average room rate of US$234 (2010: US$219).
The Langham Huntington, Pasadena, Los Angeles Under fragile local economic conditions, the Hotel shifted its focus towards the lower-yielding retail leisure and MICE markets. As a result, average occupancy increased by 11 percentage points in 2011 to 66% (2010: 55%), albeit at the expense of average room rates, which declined by 3% to US$211 (2010: US$217). Overall, revenue from rooms increased by 15% in 2011, with a corresponding growth in food and beverage revenue. With that, the Hotel turned EBITDA positive in 2011.
Delta Chelsea Hotel, Toronto Against the higher comparables of 2010 associated with the G20 summit in Toronto, the Hotel achieved stable performance with the return of corporate travellers and leisure business. Average occupancy was higher at 73% for 2011, as compared to 68% for 2010. Average room rates were constrained by a continued competitive market environment and stayed at C$127 (2010: C$126). Revenue from food and beverage increased by 9% year-on-year on increased catering demand and increased business at the

Income from Champion REIT Commencing in financial year 2011, our core profit is based on attributable dividend income from Champion REIT in respect of the same financial period as that of the Group. On that basis, total income from Champion REIT rose 3.3% year-on-year to HK$838.4 million. A higher net property income achieved by Champion REIT led to a higher asset management fee income, which offset a lower level of agency commission income. As a result overall management fee income from Champion REIT rose 0.9% from HK$262 million in 2010 to HK$264.3 million in 2011.
The following remarks are based on Champion REIT s 2011 annual results announcement relating to the performance of the REIT s properties.

The office leasing market in Central weakened in the second half of 2011, given rapidly deteriorating outlook for the global economy. However, as asking rents are still higher than passing rents at Citibank Plaza, passing rents improved to HK$85.15 per sq.ft.
as at December 2011, compared with HK$84.67 per sq.ft. as at December 2010. Given greater flexibility in pricing strategy in the second half of 2011, occupancy improved from 81.5% at the beginning of the year to 90.4% at year end. Mainly as a result of higher average occupancy, gross revenue increased by 2.2% to HK$1,154 million in 2011. However, with higher rental commission paid, net property income only increased marginally by HK$3.4 million to HK$946 million in 2011.
Langham Place Office Tower In contrast to slowing demand for office space from financial companies in Central, a continuing expansion of the services sector and relocations from Hong Kong Island created sustained demand for office space on the Kowloon Peninsular. Occupancy at Langham Place Office Tower was maintained at a high level of 96.8% at year-end 2011, as compared to 99.2% in 2010. Also, passing rents increased from HK$26.40 per sq.ft. to HK$27.43 per sq.ft. over the course of the year. However, with the expiry of a naming right agreement at the end of 2010, and the loss of associated income of about HK$14.1 million, gross revenue dropped by 4.9% to HK$254 million in 2011. Net property income also dropped by 5.1% to HK$205 million in 2011.
Langham Place Mall Foot traffic at the Mall went up even further in 2011 from the already very high levels of 2010, mainly due to more visits by tourists, especially those from Mainland China. As average gross sales of tenants at the mall improved by 24% year-on-year to HK$889 per sq.ft., the vast majority of existing tenants have been willing to pay higher rents to retain their spaces. The average passing rent rate increased from HK$97.48 per sq.ft.
at the end of 2010 to HK$100.77 at year-end.
In addition, turnover rent increased by 56% to HK$64 million in 2011. Overall, gross revenue increased by 11% to HK$532 million. Revenue growth would have been even stronger were it not for the expiry of a naming right agreement at the end of 2010 and the loss of associated income of about HK$11.9 million.
With lower rental commissions paid in 2011 and thus lower expenses incurred in 2011, net property income rose 17.5% to HK$412 million for 2011.

Great Eagle Centre Unlike the Central District, which has been affected by the global slowdown of the financial and banking industries, the Wanchai North office market remained fairly stable in 2011. Occupancy remained at very high levels for buildings in the district, which has continued to be a preferred location for Mainland Chinese companies and the services sector. Also because its relatively low rents and easy access to Central, Wanchai has also been a favourite destination for tenants fleeing the high rents of Central. Occupancy for the office portion of Great Eagle Centre eased back to 96.8% at the end of 2011 from full occupancy a year ago, due to normal tenancy rollover. However, rents achieved reached HK$60 s to HK$70 s per sq.ft. (depending on the views) as at the end of 2011, compared with high HK$50 s per sq.ft. a year earlier.
Average passing rent increased by 11.4% from HK$43.9 per sq.ft. at December 2010 to HK$48.9 per sq.ft. as of December 2011.
Occupancy for the retail portion increased from 93.5% as of 31st December 2010 to 99.4% as of 31st December 2011. All leases that expired in 2011 have been renewed at higher rates.
Even though passing rents at the Great Eagle Centre have increased during 2011, the occupation of incremental space by the Group has resulted in slower growth in overall rental income, as rental related thereto is eliminated on consolidation. Gross rental income for Great Eagle Centre increased 4.7% from HK$105.5 million in 2010 to HK$110.5 million in 2011.
On the other hand, net rental income dropped by 5.6% from HK$102.2 million in 2010 to HK$96.5 million in 2011, due to a payment related to the relocation and upgrading of the cooling water pumping facilities.
Eaton Serviced Apartments Compared with the positive momentum witnessed in the first half of 2011, when there were increased inflows of overseas professionals and hence demand for the serviced apartments, the deepening crisis in the Eurozone has negative impacted demand since the third quarter of 2011. Keen competition in the market, as well as slower demand in the second half led to a drop in occupancy from 78.5% in 2010 to 72.8% in 2011. Nonetheless, for the full year of 2011, achieved rental rate still rose 24.9% from HK$33.6 per sq.ft. in 2010 to HK$42 per sq.ft. in 2011. Gross rental income increased 14.8% year-on-year to HK$40.1 million in 2011, whereas net rental income increased 11.2% year-on-year to HK$26.5 million.
United States Properties The continued pickup in activity in the technology sector is helping the office market in San Francisco to move to more solid ground and asking rental rates are also firming up in the Bay Area. However, as the average passing rental rates for our US office portfolio remained above market levels, negative rental reversion continued in 2011 as average passing rent dropped by 2.7% from US$36.4 per sq.ft. as at the end of 2010 to US$35.5 per sq.ft. as at the end of 2011. On the other hand, occupancy rose by 3 percentage-points year-on-year to 93% as at the end of December 2011. Gross rental income increased slightly from HK$117.7 million in 2010 to HK$118.1 million in 2011. However, due to higher expenses incurred, net rental income dropped from HK$46.7 million in 2010 to HK$46.4 million in 2011.

Dalian Mixed-use Development Project The project comprises approximately 1,200 high- end apartments and a luxury international hotel with approximately 350 rooms, generating an aggregate gross floor area of approximately 286,000 sq.
metres. The project is targeted for completion in two phases from 201415 onward. The Group has a 50% equity interest in this project and acts as the project 
The progress of construction has so far been satisfactory. Excavation works at the site were completed in March 2011 and the foundation works are near completion.
Curtailed access to mortgage financing in China, together with restrictions on residential home purchases, the sales market for residential properties has slowed down considerably during 2011. Though there have been some recent expectations for looser monetary policies, as inflation moderated towards the end of 2011, there has not been any significant positive impact on the property market in Dalian.
Therefore, the marketing launch for our project will be deferred till more favourable market conditions return.
Our construction programme will also be adjusted accordingly. Nevertheless, the prime location and low land cost of our Dalian project should continue to make it a viable investment.
Up to the end of 2011, the Group has invested HK$633 million for its stake in the project.

Hotel Redevelopment Project The Langham, Chicago The Group acquired a 100% interest in a redevelopment project in downtown Chicago, USA at the end of 2010. The property comprises the lower 13 floors and part of the basement of an existing commercial building at 330 Wabash Avenue (formerly the IBM Building). It is being converted into a luxury 330-room hotel under the Langham brand. This property was acquired at a low point of the U.S. real estate market and is part of the Group s strategy to establish a presence in strategic gateway cities to anchor the Langham brand.
An internationally renowned designer has been retained in 2011 to design the hotel. Some early structural works have also been carried out in second half of 2011. Full scale construction will commence in the first quarter of 2012, and is scheduled for completion in 2013.

Gross debts denominated in HK dollars amounted to HK$1,316 million as of 31 December 2011. Our foreign currency gross debts as of 31 December 2011 amounted to the equivalent of HK$2,078 million, of which the equivalent of HK$496 million or 24% of our foreign currency debts was on fixed-rate basis.
Net of cash and bank deposits that mature within 3 months totalling the equivalent of HK$2,452 million, our consolidated net debt outstanding as of 31 December 2011 was HK$942 million, a decrease of HK$989 million from that of HK$1,931 million as of 31 
Because of the persistent low interest rate environment and in order to enhance return to shareholders, as a normal treasury function the Group has been prudently investing in quality short-term bonds which are intended to be held to maturity, and principal protected notes with reputable banks and financial institutions as counter-parties. As at 31 December 2011, investment in these bonds and notes amounted to HK$174 million. Should this amount be taken into account, the consolidated net borrowing of the Group would be reduced to HK$768 million.
Equity Attributable to Shareholders, based on professional valuation of the Group s investment properties as of 31 December 2011 and the depreciated costs of the Group s hotel properties, amounted to HK$33,589 million as of 31 December 2011. The net assets value at 31 December 2011 represented an increase of HK$3,944 million compared to the restated value of HK$29,645 million as of 31 December 2010, mainly attributable to the profit for the year including share of results of Champion REIT. Based on the consolidated net debt of HK$942 million, the resulting gearing ratio at 31 December 2011 was 3%. Should the investment in bonds and notes mentioned above be recognized in the calculation, the gearing ratio would be reduced to 
During the year, market interest rate had remained at an extremely low level. Coupled with the high interest income from the Group s investment in Champion REIT convertible bonds, the Group had earned a net interest income of HK$91 million for the year.
Consequently, there was no applicable interest cover ratio as at the balance sheet dates.
Liquidity and Debt Maturity Profile As of 31 December 2011, our cash, bank deposits and committed but undrawn loan facilities amounted to a total of HK$4,315 million. The majority of our loan facilities are secured by properties with sufficient value to loan coverage and the major portion of the loan due within one year lie in the latter part of 2012. The following is a profile of the maturity of our outstanding debts as of 31 December 2011: Within 1 year 76.2% 1-2 years 7.7% 3-5 years 16.1% Pledge of Assets At 31 December 2011, properties of the Group with a total carrying value of approximately HK$10,030 million (31 December 2010: HK$9,615 million), were mortgaged or pledged to secure credit facilities granted to its subsidiaries.
Commitments and Contingent Liabilities As at 31 December 2011, the Group had authorised capital expenditures not provided for in these financial statements amounting to approximately HK$651 million (31 December 2010: HK$74 million) of which approximately HK$71 million (31 December 2010: HK$70 million) was contracted for.
As at 31 December 2011, the Group had outstanding financial commitment of RMB26.5 million (equivalent to HK$32.5 million) (31 December 2010: HK$152 million) for capital injection to a jointly controlled entity, and commitment of RMB132 million (equivalent to HK$163 million) (31 December 2010: HK$275 million) for construction cost to complete a hotel property owned by an associate.
In addition to the above, as at 31 December 2011 the Group had provided a several corporate guarantee and a charge over its interest in the share capital of an associate to a bank in respect of its share of banking facility utilised by the associate of US$13 million (equivalent to HK$98 million) (31 December 2010: 
Other than set out above, the Group did not have any significant commitments and contingent liabilities as at 31 December 2011.

The prospects for global growth have deteriorated markedly in the past several months, as escalation of the Euro zone crisis has stalled global economic recovery and brought considerable uncertainties to the world markets. It is likely that resolution of the crisis will take time. Until then, there will be considerable volatility in the markets that we operate in. Therefore, even though the performance of our major profit contributing businesses has remained intact in recent months, we must remain vigilant and be ready to adjust our strategies accordingly.
Despite the weaker global economic outlook, we remain cautiously optimistic on the prospects for our hotels in Hong Kong in 2012, in part because of the inflow of tourist arrivals from Mainland China has so far shown little signs of slowing down. However, we are expecting the performance of our overseas hotels to be affected to varying degrees in 2012.
The contribution from Champion REIT should remain fairly stable in 2012. There might be some weakness in the income of Citibank Plaza because of softer demand in the Central office market. That however should be compensated to a certain extent by the strength of the Langham Place Mall, where positive rental reversions will lead to higher property income.
Over the past several years, we have enhanced our financial resilience through aggressive reduction of debts. With a very low gearing position, we are on a strong footing to face the challenges of the forthcoming volatility in global markets.
