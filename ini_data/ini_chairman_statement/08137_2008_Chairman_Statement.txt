The Board of Directors believes that the trend of normal development has been established for the magazine publication business, which generates stable income for the Group.

On behalf of the Board, I would like to take this opportunity to thank our shareholders for their continued support and all staff for their hard work. We look forward to a prosperous 2008, generating higher investment returns to our shareholders.
