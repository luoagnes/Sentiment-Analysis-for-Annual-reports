The Directors have declared a fourth interim dividend of HK$2.20 per share. This brings the total distribution for 2013 to HK$5.50 per share up from HK$5.30 in 2012. We remain committed to a dividend policy that reflects a good balance between annual distributions and investment for future growth.

The global economic environment improved in 2013. The US economy expanded at a moderate pace, supported by indications of a recovery in the housing market. Conditions in the eurozone stabilised, with the region returning to economic growth in the second quarter following an 18-month recession.
Favourable labour market conditions in Hong Kong underpinned consumer spending, supporting steady GDP growth of 3% for the first three quarters of the year. Trade activity, however, remained weak with the improvement in the global economy yet to be reflected in export demand. Private consumption remains the key economic driver and we expect 2013 full-year growth of 3%.
Mainland China s economy grew by 7.7% in 2013 the same as in 2012 and above the official target of 7.5%.
The government s selective stimulation policies supported domestic consumption and investment, with real GDP expanding by 7.8% in the second half of the year up from 7.6% in the first half. Economic challenges will persist, but domestic drivers should remain resilient and we expect real GDP growth of 7.6% for 2014.
Asia will generally benefit from the recovery in the international economy, although the reduction of quantitative easing measures in the US will continue to create some challenges and uncertainty in the region. Closer economic integration in the Greater China region and Hong Kong s position as a primary centre for offshore renminbi financial services will open up new avenues for business.
