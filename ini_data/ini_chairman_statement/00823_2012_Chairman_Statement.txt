Since the listing of The Link REIT, we have been committed to building success by better serving the people around us, based on our vision, mission and values. With a portfolio that serves over 40% of Hong Kong s households, we are dedicated to providing our tenants with facilities that can support the community s needs.
To align our actions with our mission in providing value and quality service, partnering with local communities and delivering sustainable growth, the prime priorities of our management teams have been tenant sustainability and community well-being.

If we are to continuously improve our standards, we have to invest in our people. Properly equipping our staffs is crucial to delivering service excellence, while adhering to our core values.
Through prioritising staff well-being, learning and development, we can strengthen staff morale and ensure that all have consistent objectives, in terms of service quality and commitment.
All these have only one goal to provide a better shopping experience for a thriving community.
OUTLOOK AND APPRECIATION Uncertainty in Europe is likely to continue, since reforms will take time. In China, rising commodity prices and slowing GDP growth suggest a cooling economy. For Hong Kong, local retail sales are still growing albeit more slowly, while household income, including those from public housing, has generally increased. So despite external uncertainties, local economic stability gives us reasons for optimism over retailing. The Link REIT is committed to build on our expertise and grow beyond the existing portfolio, by seeking opportunities for inorganic growth in Hong Kong.
The Board is grateful to Dr. Allan ZEMAN, who has been an independent non-executive director of the Manager for seven years. Dr. Allan ZEMAN has played a most valuable role in the development of The Link REIT during his term. The Board and its Nomination Committee will continue to review the composition and performance of the Board on an ongoing basis.
The Board would also like to take this opportunity to extend its sincere gratitude to our management and staff, whose professionalism and commitment have been crucial to our continual success. I have full confidence that, with the dedication of our people, The Link REIT will prosper and build a sustainable business that everyone can be proud of in the future.
