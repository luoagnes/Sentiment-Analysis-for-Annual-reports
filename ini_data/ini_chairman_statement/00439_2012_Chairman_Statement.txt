Loss attributable to shareholders for the year ended 31 March 2012 was approximately HK$5 million. Loss per share slightly increased to HK4.86 cents as compared to HK4.43 cents in previous year.
Trading of the Company s shares has been suspended since 23 September 2008. On 14 December 2011, the Listing Committee of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the Stock Exchange ) agreed to allow the Company to proceed with its resumption proposal, subject to the compliance with the resumption conditions to the satisfaction of the Listing Division of the Stock Exchange, by 13 June 2012.

Upon the completion of the transactions contemplated under the resumption proposal of the Company which include, among others, the capital reorganisation, the acquisition of the paper business, the share subscription, the open offer and the bonus issue on 3 May 2012, the Group could generate additional turnover and have sufficient level of operations and assets.
