Both Middle East and South America recorded a growth, of which turnover of South America substantially increased from approximately HK$10 million in 2001 to approximately HK$31.7 million in 2002, representing an increase of 217%.

After the suspension and disposal of the business of distribution of computer components, selling and manufacturing of watches became the core and major revenue contribution business of the Group. Based on the current market conditions, the Board anticipates that the coming year will be more challenging and difficult to the Group as the global economy remains sluggish since the terrorism attack in the US and the warfare in Iraq. Tensions still exist owing to the turbulent situation in Middle East after the war which is one of the major markets of the Group at present. The Company will continue to cautiously allocate resources on other geographic segment with relatively stable market conditions. The economy of Hong Kong and PRC has been further affected by the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ). The underlying impact of such contagion on the overall economy is not yet revealed and the prolonged period is unforeseeable.
Despite the unfavorable economic environment, the Board believes that the huge market of China still provides good opportunities and the Group will continue to explore new business and investment opportunities with good potential as to diversify the Group s business and bring in new sources of income. It will continue to enhance efficiencies by way of streamline operation, retrenching of organization structure and costs reduction, and it may consider any business rationalization whenever it deems appropriate after evaluation of existing business and future development plan from time to time, in order to improve its financial position and enhance shareholders value as a whole.

Last but not least, I would like to thank my fellow directors, dedicated employees, our supportive shareholders and our loyal customers and suppliers for their confidence and continued support in
