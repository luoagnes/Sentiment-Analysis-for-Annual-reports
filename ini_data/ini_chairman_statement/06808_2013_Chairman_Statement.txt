CHAIRMAN S STATEMENT 
It gives me great pleasure to report to you the substantial progress made in 2012 by Sun Art Retail Group Limited, posting again solid results in the second year after our IPO.
We have, during a year of slowing GDP growth, been able to continue to improve our profitability while opening 43 new stores, gaining market share in a context where investment in our industry has been rather subdued compared to previous years.
We believe our continuous emphasis on customer needs, which are changing by the day, and investment in employee training, explains this performance and will continue to help us to ensure a high level of customer satisfaction, translating into sustained levels of turnover, margins and profit for the Company.
In 2013, our Board, beyond monitoring financials, integrating principal risks and ensuring compliance, will provide further strategic guidance to our management team to continue to grow at a sustained rate, and face multi-faceted competitive challenges in China s retail market.
