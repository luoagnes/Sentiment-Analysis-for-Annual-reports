CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
FORGING AHEAD ALONG THE NEW SILK ROAD
Despite significant challenges in 2016, Kerry Logistics continued to make steady progress. More importantly, we are
able to help existing customers overcome difficulties and add new customers from a range of industries.
Aligning ourselves with China’s game-changing One Belt, One Road Initiative, we are systematically expanding our
network by sea, air, road and rail. Our intention is to become a major logistics service provider for the new Silk Road
of the 21st century. The acquisition of a freight forwarding group based in CIS will significantly expand our coverage
in Central Asia. The opening of new road and rail freight routes from China to Europe and Pakistan will enable us to
offer different options to our customers.
The acquisition of APEX has greatly enhanced our trans-Pacific capability. Kerry Logistics has become a major mover
of freight between Asia and North America.
Cross-border e-commerce between Greater China and ASEAN is booming. We are strengthening our express platform
in various Southeast Asian countries to serve expanding demand both by air and through our road transportation
network.
Step by step, we are becoming the premier logistics service provider in Asia. Our tagline is Asia Specialist, China
Focus, Global Network. We are constantly improving the menu of solutions available to our customers. With the world
trading system in flux, new solutions will be needed. Whatever changes may result from policy changes in the US and
other countries, Kerry Logistics stands ready to help our customers adjust to them quickly and optimally
