Chairman s Statement 
On behalf of the Board of Directors, I hereby present the annual report of the Company for 2008 for your review.
The year 2008 was an out of the ordinary year for the automobile industry of the PRC. Amid global fi nancial crisis, austerity measures as well as changes in policy and regulations of the PRC, the production and sales of automobile industry experienced severe fl uctuation during the year. The sales of vehicles shrank sharply in the second half of the year after a strong growth in the fi rst half of the year. The annual sales volume of vehicles of automobile manufacturers in the PRC was approximately 9,381,000 units, representing an increase of approximately 6.7% over last year. However, the growth rate represented a drop of approximately 15.1 percentage points when compared with that of 2007.
Despite a number of unfavourable factors, the Dongfeng Motor Group recorded satisfactory sales. In 2008, the aggregate sales volume of vehicles of the Dongfeng Motor Group was approximately 1,058,000 units, representing an increase of approximately 11.4% over last year, which is approximately 4.7 percentage points higher than the industry average. Of the sales volume, passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles accounted for approximately 727,000 units and approximately 331,000 units, representing an increase of approximately 14.0% and approximately 6.1% over last year, which is approximately 6.7 percentage points and approximately 0.9 percentage points higher than the industry averages, respectively. Leveraging on its diversifi ed product mix to expand in different market segments, the Dongfeng Motor Group successfully mitigated its exposure to the downturn of automobile industry in the PRC. In 2008, the Dongfeng Motor Group commanded a market share of approximately 11.3%, representing an increase of approximately 0.5 percentage points over 2007.
In 2008, the Group s sales revenue was approximately RMB70,569 million, representing a year-on-year increase of approximately 19.0% and a compound growth rate for the last three years of approximately 19.1%. Profi t attributable to shareholders of the Company was approximately RMB4,040 million, representing a year-on-year increase of approximately 7.2% and a compound growth rate for the last three years of approximately 36.2%. The earnings per share was approximately RMB46.89 cents, representing an increase of approximately 7.2% over last year. If the write-back of deferred tax for previous years accounted in the annual results of last year is excluded, the actual operating results of 2008 would present a growth of approximately 24.3% over last year. The Dongfeng Motor Group is one of the most profi table auto makers in the PRC.
In 2008, the Dongfeng Motor Group promptly adjusted its investment plans according to the changes in the marco economy and automobile industry of the PRC. The total investment for the year was approximately RMB6,151 million which was reasonably adequate for expansion of capacity to meet market demand while at the same time the capacity investment was controlled at a reasonable level. As at the end of 2008, the total annual whole vehicle production capacity of the Dongfeng Motor Group amounted to approximately 1,312,000 units. The Dongfeng Motor Group also achieved signifi cant improvement in various aspects of operations such as advertising and marketing, the optimization and expansion of distribution network, research and development and protection of intellectual property rights, energy saving and environmental protection, production safety as well as the protection of employees interests in 2008.
Looking forward, despite the uncertainties in the automobile industry in the PRC, we consider this just a temporary turbulence faced by the industry, which is still in its fast-growth phase in 2009. Furthermore, at the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009, with the introduction of various stimulus policies and measures for the automobile industry by the PRC government, we are confi dent that the long term development of the industry would be promising. The Dongfeng Motor Group has made appropriate business arrangements for 2009. In spite of the diffi cult situation ahead, the Dongfeng Motor Group will continue to improve its operations and turn challenges into opportunities so as to achieve a general improvement in its operation and results.
