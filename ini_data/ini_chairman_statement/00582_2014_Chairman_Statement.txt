Letter from the Board 
On behalf of the board of directors (the Director(s) ) (the Board ) of Landing International Development Limited (the Company ), I have pleasure to report on the financial results, operations and other aspects of the Company and its subsidiaries (the Group ) for the year ended 31 December 2013.

For the year ended 31 December 2013, the Group s consolidated turnover was approximately HK$181,075,000 (2012: HK$156,265,000). A loss attributable to equity holders of the Company of approximately HK$137,147,000 was recorded (2012: loss of HK$303,948,000). The basic and diluted loss per share was HK3.46 cents (2012: basic and diluted loss per share of HK19.0 cents) 
As at 31 December 2013, the consolidated net asset value per share attributable to equity holders of the Company was HK$0.08 (2012: 
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS REVIEW OF OPERATION During the year, the principal activity of the Company is investment holding and through its subsidiaries, the Company engages in (i) the design, manufacturing and sale of the light-emitting diode ( LED ) (the Lighting Business ) and (ii) the property development (the 
The loss for the year was mainly attributed to the loss incurred in the Lighting Business, the expenses resulted from the Property Development which is expected to generate revenue in near future, the imputed interest on convertible bonds recognised during the year and the rise in administrative expenses, including operating lease payments and employee benefits expenses.

The revenue of the Lighting Business amounted to approximately HK$181,075,000 for the year ended 31 December 2013, represented an increase of 15.9% comparing with last year. Such increase was driven by rise of the local demand for the LED industry. As the result of this segment improved and accordingly, no impairment of goodwill in respect of the cash-generating unit (the CGU ) this business has been provided (2012: HK$128,257,000).
The recoverable amount of the CGU has been determined by income- based approach adopted by Roma Appraisals Limited (the Valuer ), an independent qualified valuer, based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections based on financial budgets covering a five-year period approved by senior management of the Company.
Detail of the goodwill is set out in the note 18 to the consolidated 
In the process of the valuation, the Valuer has taken into account of the uniqueness of the business operation and the LED industry in which the Lighting Business is participating. The income-based approach has been adopted rather than market-based approach or asset-based approach since the income-based approach could better reflect the market value of the Lighting Business without omitting most of the important assumptions.
Key underlying assumptions and respective changes used in the cash flow projections are summarized as follows: Average gross margins of 28% (2012: 27%) and average growth rate of 14% (2012: 10%) to reflect the improvement of the Lighting Business with reference to the average performance in the previous years; Discount rate of 12.55% (2012: 13.57%) is used with reference to the current market data for the relevant industry and comparable companies; and Terminal growth rate of 3.22% (2012: 2.92%) is used with reference to the average China inflation rate in the past five 
Despite the improvement during the current year was recorded, the business growth of the Lighting Business as well as the pricing of LED products was lower than expected as the Lighting Business has been continuously and adversely affected by the keen competition within 
To generate diversified income source for the Group s continuous development, the Company acquired the entire issued share capital of Double Earn Holdings Limited ( Double Earn ), a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands with limited liability, at a consideration of HK$550,000,000 (the Yueyang Acquisition ).
Double Earn and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Double Earn Group ) is principally engaged in the development and operation of a parcel of land situated on the western shores of Nanhu Lake # (WSVn), Yueyang, Hunan Province, the People s Republic of China ( PRC ) (the Yueyang Project Site ), which will be developed into high-end residential properties with club houses and parking lots. The Yueyang Acquisition was completed on 7 June 2013. Construction work has been commenced in July 2013 but not yet to be completed for sale during the year ended 31 December 2013.

During the year, transaction volume increased with improvement in gross profit margin due to gradual recovery of the global economy and the restoration of customer demand as compared to the year of 2012. However, more new competitors have entered into the LED market in the PRC with lower technological barrier, causing keen competition in the market for LED related products and unstable customers order. As such, the management will thoroughly monitor and review both the operations and financial performance of the Lighting Business to formulate long-term business strategy for the Group in the coming year, which may include restructuring or downsizing the Lighting Business if it continues to operate in an 
The Directors strived to improve the business operations and financial position of the Group by proactively seeking potential investment opportunities that could diversify its existing business portfolio and broaden its source of income, and enhance value to the shareholders of the Company (the Shareholders ).

Pre-sale of the residential properties at the Yueyang Project Site has started in January 2014.

In line with the economic growth, the disposable income per capita and urbanization rate in Yueyang have also recorded persistent increase over the past decade. The increase in disposable income and urbanization rates are both key drivers of the property market growth. Therefore, it is expected that the favorable outcome of these figures will drive the domestic demand for luxurious residential districts in Yueyang.
