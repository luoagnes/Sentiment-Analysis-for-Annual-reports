China s passenger vehicle market achieved a stable growth in 2015, featured by lower demand for sedans but continued strong growth in demand for Sport Utility Vehicles ( SUVs ) and stable growth in Multi-Purpose Vehicles. The sales volume of indigenous brand passenger vehicles grew 15.3% year-on-year ( YoY ) in 2015, mainly driven by growth in sales volume of indigenous brand SUVs, compared with the 7.3% YoY growth of the overall China passenger vehicle market according to China Association of Automobile 
Despite our group s focusing on the sedan segment, which has been the weakest part of China s passenger vehicle market, the sales volume of our group in the China market was up a respectful 35.2% YoY in 2015 as a result of the good response to our new sedan models like New Emgrand (previously known as Xindihao , an upgraded version of EC7 ), New Vision (new version of our Vision sedan) and Geely GC9 during the year. Our group s strong sales volume growth in 2015 was also partly due to a low base for comparison in 2014, when our sales performance in the China market was affected by the restructuring of our sales and marketing system in China and the commencement of a major model upgrading cycle.
Separately, the performance of our group s export sales was also affected by the uncertain political and economic environment in some of our major export markets, and the weakening of emerging market currencies against United States Dollar ( US$ ) and thus RMB in 2015. Our group s export sales volume recorded a 56.9% YoY decline but this contributed a 6.0% of China s total export of passenger vehicles in 2015 according to CAAM, making us one of the major vehicle exporters in China.

CHAIRMAN S STATEMENT 
Our group sold a total of 510,097 units of vehicles in 2015, up 22.1% from 417,851 units in 2014, of which 484,363 units were sold domestically, up 35.2% from 2014, whilst the remaining 25,734 units or 5.0% were sold abroad, down 56.9% from 2014. Our most popular models in 2015 included New Emgrand , New Vision , Geely GC9 and Geely Kingkong , which together accounted for 76.4% of our group s total sales volume in 2015.

Our group s financial performance in 2015 was in line with our expectations with total revenue increased by 38.6% to RMB30.14 billion for the year ended 31 December 2015 as better than expected domestic sales volume growth was offset by weaker exports and foreign exchange losses. The mid-size sedan model New Emgrand remained our group s most popular model in terms of sales volume, accounting for 38.9% of our total sales volume in 2015. Despite this, our group s ex-factory average selling price ( ASP ) continued to improve in 2015, mainly driven by the improvement in product mix (i.e. higher proportion of higher-priced models).
Total net profit of our group grew 57.9% from RMB1.45 billion in 2014 to RMB2.29 billion in 2015 due to the increase in overall sales volume, higher ASP and stable profit margin, despite the inclusion of unrealized foreign exchange loss arising from our operations in Russia and the unrealized currency translation loss on the issuance of US$300 million 5.25% 5-year senior notes in October 2014 (the Senior Notes ). After accounting for non-controlling interests, our net profit attributable to shareholders was up 58.0% from RMB1.43 billion in 2014 to RMB2.26 billion in 2015. Diluted earnings per share was up 57.9% to RMB25.66 cents.
During the year, our manufacturing operations continued to generate good operational cash inflow with our group s total cash level (bank balances and cash + pledged bank deposits) increasing 27.0% to RMB9.21 billion at the end of

CHAIRMAN S STATEMENT 
Our board of directors recommends the payment of a final dividend of HK$3.8 cents per share for 2015 (2014: HK$2.5 cents per share).

In the face of increasing challenges caused by uncertain economic environments globally and fierce competition in both of our domestic and export markets, we have achieved initial success in new product development and in establishing a more efficient sales and distribution network after the restructuring of our sales and marketing functions, thus further enhancing the quality of our products and services. Apart from our dedication to the mission of Creating Fine Cars for Everybody ( k PNv|T) under Geely brand, we have also been allocating more resources in the development and distribution of New Energy Vehicles in view of the anticipated increase in demand for these vehicles.
The launch of Blue Geely Initiative (r T)RLR) in November 2015 signified the cornerstone of our new energy strategy. I have no doubt that the successful execution of these initiatives would lead our group entering into a new development era (i.e. New Geely Era (e T)RBfN)) and becoming a much stronger Geely in the future.

The technological cooperation between our group and Volvo Car Corporation, which is majority-owned by our group s parent, Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Company Limited (Ym _l T)RcW gPlQS), has achieved significant progress during the year, enabling our group to further optimizing resource utilization, and speeding up the implementation of platform strategy, standardization, and shared modularization in product development. The cooperation should create huge benefits of synergy, enhancing our technologies, product quality and brand image which, in turn, should equip us with strong and unique advantages over our competitors.
I am confident that the positive results from the cooperation would become increasingly obvious in the coming years, thus boding well for our group s competitive strength in the areas of technology, quality and brand.

I firmly believe that our group is on the right track to achieve the long-term goal of becoming a leading global automobile group with good reputation and integrity, winning respects from our customers. Finally, I would like to pay tribute to all our staff for their hard work and achievements during 2015 and to our shareholders for their continued support.
