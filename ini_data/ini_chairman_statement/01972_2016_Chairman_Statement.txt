Adjusted so as to exclude a loss of HK$229 million on disposal of four hotels in the U.K., underlying profit increased to HK$7,307 million in 2015 from HK$7,152 million in 2014. The increase principally reflects good performances from the office portfolio in Hong Kong and from the retail portfolio in Mainland China. The underlying profit from property investment increased by 3%. There were higher profits from property trading, reflecting the sale of luxury residential properties in Hong Kong and the sale of offices in Mainland China. The hotel results were adversely affected by the loss on disposal referred to above and pre-opening costs at hotels in Chengdu in Mainland China and in Miami in the U.S.A.
Gross rental income was HK$10,716 million in 2015 compared to HK$10,320 million in 2014. Rental income increased both in Hong Kong and Mainland China, as rental reversions were generally positive. In Hong Kong, office occupancy levels were firm. Retail sales in Hong Kong were adversely affected by reduced spending by tourists. In Mainland China, retail sales of luxury goods were weak.
However, sales in our retail portfolios increased and demand for our retail space was firm.
Operating profit from property trading increased in 2015, principally because of the completion of the sales of the majority of the units at the AREZZO development in Hong Kong.
On an attributable basis, net investment property valuation gains in 2015, after deferred tax relating to investment properties in Mainland China and the U.S.A., were HK$7,055 million, compared to net gains of HK$2,437 million in 2014.

Net debt at 31st December 2015 was HK$33,348 million, compared with HK$34,071 million at 31st December 2014. Gearing decreased from 16.3% at 31st December 2014 to 15.3% at 31st December 2015. The decrease in net debt was mainly due to receipt of sales proceeds from trading properties in Hong Kong and in Miami, partially offset by expenditure on investment and trading properties in Hong Kong and on the Brickell City Centre development in Miami. Cash and undrawn committed facilities totalled HK$12,193 million at 31st December 2015, compared with HK$9,622 million at 31st December 2014.

In Hong Kong, demand for office space improved in 2015. In 2016, high occupancy and limited supply will put upward pressure on rents in Central despite a slowdown in demand for office space by Mainland Chinese entities. High occupancy is expected to result in rents in Taikoo Place and Cityplaza being reasonably resilient despite increased supply in Kowloon East and other districts. In Guangzhou, office rents are expected to be stable in 2016 despite a substantial supply of new office space. In Beijing, office rents are expected to weaken in 2016 as substantial amounts of new office space become available and demand falls.
Demand for retail space in Hong Kong is expected generally to weaken in 2016. But there is growth in demand for quality space from tenants engaged in successful businesses. Overall retail sales are expected to grow modestly in Guangzhou and Beijing and steadily in Chengdu.
In Hong Kong, buyers of property have become more cautious in the light of expected interest rate increases and general economic uncertainties. Trading profits are expected to be recognised in 2016 from the sales of the remaining units at the Hong Kong developments and from the sales of units at the Reach and Rise developments in Miami.
Trading conditions for our hotels in Hong Kong and Mainland China are expected to be challenging 
On behalf of the shareholders and my fellow Directors, I wish to express our appreciation to all our employees, whose commitment and hard work have been central to our continuing success.
