BUSINESS REVIEW AND OUTLOOK 
We are very pleased to share with you that the Group achieved revenue of HK$14,716 million for the year ended 31 March 2012 which was slightly increased by 4.9% as compared to last year. The net profit for the year was HK$1,351 million and was decreased by 26.9% as compared to last year. At as 31 March 2012, the Group s net gearing ratio was 65% as a result of the capacity expansion. The Board considers this to be a healthy and reasonable debt level.
Our new production lines, PM 15 and PM 16 have been started in August 2011 and November 2011 respectively; PM 17 (the production line of coated duplex board) will commission production in July 2012. The Group has begun construction of its fifth paper production industrial park located at Ruichang City of Jiangxi Province, which will allow it to capture the demand for quality containerboard in the central and western part of China. PM18, our production machine at Jiangxi plant, is under construction and is expected to begin operation by March 2013. Within the responsible debt level, the Group will constructively expand its production capacity in order to create favorable conditions in future 
Impacted by external whirlwinds, such as the faltering US and Europe economy and the sovereign debt crisis in Europe; both the performance of the domestic and export market are unsatisfied.
Though the Group has been expanding its production capacity, its average selling price has been decreased. The Group was not fully able to pass through the increase in salaries and corresponding production cost to its customers. Hence the existing business environment is still difficult. The Group will continually control costs closely, spreading our production plants in China and expanding its production capacity. When the economy of the global market improves, the Group will be able to deliver better returns to the
