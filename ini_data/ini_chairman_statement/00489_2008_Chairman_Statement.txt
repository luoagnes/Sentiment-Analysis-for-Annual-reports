Chairman s Statement 
On behalf of the Board of Directors, I hereby present the annual report of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2007 for your review.
In 2007, the annual sales volume of vehicles of automobile manufacturers in China was 8,790,000 units, representing an increase of 21.84% over last year; of which passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles accounted for 6,300,000 units and 2,490,000 units, representing an increase of 21.68% and 22.25% over last year respectively. It is shown that the industry is under rapid growth. Against such a favourable background, Dongfeng Motor Group recorded outstanding operation results. In 2007, the aggregate sales volume of vehicles of Dongfeng Motor Group was 949,500 units, representing an increase of 26.50% over last year, which is even higher than the industry growth rate of 4.66 percentage points. Of the sales volume, passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles accounted for 638,000 units and 311,500 units, representing an increase of approximately 28.89% and 21.58% over last year respectively. The product and sales mix of the Dongfeng Motor Group were more reasonable. In general, Dongfeng Motor Group has been able to secure top rankings in its market segments.
During the year, Dongfeng Motor Group has introduced approximately 8 brand new and modifi ed models for its major line of passenger vehicles to the market, posting a strong support to the growth of production and sales of passenger vehicles. Since the launch of New Dongfeng Honda CRV in March 2007, an annual sales of over 40,000 units has been recorded, representing the largest market share of 4WD SUVs. New models of commercial vehicles were also recognised by the market, resulting in an improved production and sales mix. The annual sales volume of new generation Dongfeng Kinland heavy trucks amounted to 21,956 units.
In 2007, the Group s sales revenue and profi t attributable to shareholders of the Company was approximately RMB59.318 billion and RMB3.77 billion, representing an increase of approximately 22.9% and 81.2% over last year respectively. The earning per share was approximately RMB43.76 cents, representing an increase of approximately 81.2%. If the one-off write-back of deferred tax for previous years of approximately RMB0.521 billion is excluded, the adjusted profi t attributable to shareholders would amount to approximately RMB3.249 billion. The profi t margin before interest and taxes and the net profi t margin was 7% and 6.4%, representing an increase of approximately 0.7 percentage points and 2.1 percentage points over last year. The inventory turnover in 2007 decreased to 56 days from 65 days of last year. The overall effi ciency and quality of the Group s operation were further improved and enhanced accordingly.
In 2007, the investment of the Dongfeng Motor Group was made as planned with the actual investment amount of approximately RMB7.92 billion for the year. The production capacity has been expanded steadily and the total production capacity amounted to approximately 1,117,000 units as of the end of the year. The distribution network was expanded as scheduled with more than 3,900 sales outlets at all levels, including those for passenger and commercial vehicles. In respect of research and development and intellectual property, we have made a signifi cant advancement by improving our capabilities of independent research and development.
In addition, the Dongfeng Motor Group places great emphasis on its social responsibilities and signifi cant and effective efforts have been made to recognise the importance of treating clients interests with respect, energy conservation and environment protection, production safety and protection of staff interests.
While we have made a general advancement in all respects, the Board of Directors recognises that there are still challenges and diffi culties ahead. The annual sales volume of Dongfeng Peugeot Citron Automobiles Company Ltd. and Dongfeng Nissan Passenger Vehicle Company have failed to meet the expected targets, and the growth rate of sales of commercial vehicles, particularly heavy trucks, has been lower than that of the industry. Looking ahead, we believe that 2008 will still be a unprecedented booming year for the PRC automobile industry. With the encouraging growth prospect, the annual sales volume of vehicles in the industry is expected to be above 10,000,000 units. We also realise that, however, the economy of China will see macro-control pressures in 2008.
The sales price of vehicles will be lowered due to intensifi ed market competition and it will be more diffi cult to control the cost because of higher prices of raw materials. The Dongfeng Motor Group will endeavour to address and settle all these issues in a proactive way.
