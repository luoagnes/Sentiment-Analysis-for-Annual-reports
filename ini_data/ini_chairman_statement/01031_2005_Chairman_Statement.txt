For the year ended 31 December 2004, the Group s turnover was approximately HK$142 million, representing a increase of 57% as compared to HK$90 million in last year.

Hong Kong, Middle East and South America are still the Group s primary markets.

Energy Saving Business As the Group is strategically diversified into the hotel business in Macau, the Group has entered into a sale and purchase agreement on 10 January 2005 to dispose of the investment in the energy saving business and the consideration from which will be preserved for the acquisition or development of the Group s hotel business.

The Group is principally engaged in the manufacturing and trading of watches and watch components, the provision of electroplating services, investment holding, property holding and hotel business.
Manufacturing and trading of watches and watches components The Group will continue to focus on the markets of South America, Middle East as well as Hong Kong.
Cost control policy will remain in place with the aim to further minimize the cost and improve the efficiency of the business.

In 2004, the economy of Hong Kong has experienced upward improvement from which most of the business has benefited. At the same time, economy of Macau has also been booming. With the introduction of Individual Traveller s Scheme by the PRC government and the opening of more casinos, the number of tourists, especially those from the PRC, to Macau has been significantly increased. Their consumption in Macau stimulates enormous business opportunity and growth potentials in the tourism industry and the situation is expected to sustain in the future.
The directors believe that the Group is able to capture the results of the economic boom in Macau through active investment in the hotel business with gaming entertainment in the territory. The strategic diversification of the Group into the hotel business will enhance the Group s profitability and maximize returns for its shareholders.
In late November 2004, the Group proposed to acquire Grandview Hotel and the transaction was completed by end March 2005. In January 2005, the Group proposed to acquire Hotel Casa Real through the acquisition of Hang Huo Hotel Company Limited and the transaction is still subject to approval by shareholders in May this year. Both are four star hotels with casino facilities. As gaming entertainment is one of the most popular activities for tourists in Macua, the Group will further expand the casinos in the hotels with the aim to attract and retain more tourists staying at the hotels.

The hotel is located at Taipa and it takes approximately 5 minutes traveling to the Macau International Airport and 10 minutes traveling to the New Macau Maritime Ferry Terminal. It has a total of 407 guest rooms and facilities including spa, outdoor swimming pool, fitness center, children care room and the casino. There are also Chinese and western restaurants and lobby lounge. Given the proximity to major transportation terminals in Macau, the management believes that the occupancy rate of Grandview hotel will increase in line with the overall growth in the tourism industry in the region. The Group has started renovation immediately subsequent to the completion of the acquisition by end March 2005 and will expand the casino and launch various promotion activities to further promote the hotel.
Hotel Casa Real The hotel is located at Macau, approximately 5 minutes traveling to the Macau Ferry Terminal. It has a total of about 381 guest rooms and facilities including swimming pool, fitness center, retail shop and a casino with both slot machines and gaming tables. There are also Chinese and western restaurants and a coffee shop.
Similar to Grandview Hotel, the Group will undertake various refurbishment works and marketing activity once the transaction is completed in order to further promote the hotel and improve the occupancy rate 
The directors are confident that the diversification into the hotel business with gaming entertainment in Macau will enhance the earnings base of the Group which in turn will maximize the shareholder s return in the future. The management will continue to look for potential investment projects in Macau as well as elsewhere with the aim to further leverage the resources of the Group and strive to achieve a satisfactory result in near future.
