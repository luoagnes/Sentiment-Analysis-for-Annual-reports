The directors of Television Broadcasts Limited
(“Directors”) are pleased to present the 2008 annual
report and financial statements in respect of Television
Broadcasts Limited (the “Company” or “TVB”) and its
subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”).
RESULTS AND DIVIDEND
For the full year, the Group’s turnover increased
by 2%, from HK$4,326 million to HK$4,407 million.
We saw our cost of sales increased by 15%, from
HK$1,764 million to HK$2,025 million during the year.
As a result, the profit attributable to shareholders
decreased by 17%, from HK$1,264 million to
HK$1,055 million. Earnings per share was HK$2.41
(2007: HK$2.89). At the year end, our total equity
stood at HK$5,634 million (2007: HK$5,369 million).
At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting in May
2009, Directors will recommend a final dividend of
HK$1.40 per share. Together with the interim dividend
of HK$0.30 per share paid earlier, this makes a total
dividend of HK$1.70 per share for the full year ended
31 December 2008, and represents a decrease of 6%
over 2007 and a 71% payout to our current year’s
profit.
BUSINESS AND OUTLOOK
2008 was an eventful year. At the beginning of the
year, we established another milestone in our history
as we began full-time digital terrestrial TV broadcasting
service in Hong Kong. A year later, we now provide
a total of five digital terrestrial TV channels, covering
over 75% of the population in Hong Kong.
We witnessed in May 2008 the tragic earthquake in
Sichuan, which brought about over 400,000 casualties
and made millions homeless. As of today, the pictures
of the disaster are still vivid in our mind. Soon after
the disaster struck, we mobilised our forces and
helped organise a number of fund raising events
on our channels in Hong Kong and overseas. The
responses were over-whelming and heart warming,
and we are grateful to the donors for their kindness.
Then in August 2008, we celebrated the long-awaited
Beijing 2008 Olympic Games with pride and a sense
of achievement. TVB once again made history by
delivering round-the-clock high definition TV coverage
with surround sound, rewarding our audience with real
life experience of the events.
Problems associated with financial institutions
worldwide which began to surface in the second half
of 2008 has rapidly led to a global economy downturn.
Our business has been adversely affected as
advertising income, a major revenue source in Hong
Kong, began to decline, negating the growth in the
earlier parts of the year. On the other hand, business
in our overseas markets was less severely affected, as
our licensing and subscription model helped deliver a
relatively steady revenue stream.
Our total costs increased in 2008, as a result of the
launch of new digital channels and other special
projects such as the Beijing Olympics. Going forward,
we shall vigilantly control operating and capital costs
to reduce the adverse impact on our bottom line while
exploring new revenue sources.
Our belief in maintaining a continuous supply of
quality programmes for terrestrial TV channels and
international distribution remains. We will, therefore,
continue to dedicate our efforts to investing in our
future business for growth and, at the same time, to
reinforce our position in the market.
Lastly, on behalf of the Board, I sincerely wish to
thank all our stakeholders for their endorsement and
support to the Group.

Executive Chairman
