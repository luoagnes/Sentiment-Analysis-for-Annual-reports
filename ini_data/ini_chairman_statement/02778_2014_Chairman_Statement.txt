otal Revenue increased 5.8% in 2013, to HK$2,179 million. As revenue at Citibank Plaza was held flat by weak demand by financial institutions, the improvement at the REIT level was driven by Langham Place.
Langham Place Mall experienced a bumper year, with its revenue rising 16.8%. This was on the back of rising tenant sales, especially on fashion accessories and cosmetics.
Revenue derived from the Langham Place Office Tower also rose, buoyed by the tight Grade-A office market outside of Central.
Property Operating Expenses rose 9.7% to HK$431 million, primarily due to inflating wage costs, and in some instances increased staffing levels. After taking into account the increase in operating expenses, Total Net Property Income improved by 4.9% over the previous year, to HK$1,748 million.
Profit After Tax decreased from HK$4,160 million in 2012 to HK$2,199 million for the year, mainly due to lower non-cash revaluation gains of only HK$1,117 million as compared to HK$3,243 million for 2012. Excluding revaluation gains and other items that are non-cash in nature from the year s accounting profit, Distributable Income is HK$1,271 million. The Distribution Amount, after retention of HK$70 million, is HK$1,201 million, an increase of 1.3% year-on-year. The Distribution Per Unit ( DPU ) for the second half of the year is HK$0.1104.
Combined with the HK$0.0998 paid out for the first half, the total DPU for this year is marginally higher at HK$0.2102.
In July 2013 Champion REIT completed the purchase of four floors with a gross floor area of 78,316 sq. ft. (lettable 54,896 sq. ft.) at Citibank Plaza, funding the HK$2.16 billion transaction through bank debt. With this latest acquisition, the ownership of Citibank Plaza is now unified under the Trust, giving the REIT Manager full control over the entire Citibank Plaza property. This will facilitate the implementation of leasing strategy, asset enhancement activities amongst other benefits.
Following the completion of the acquisition, total debt increased to HK$14.7 billion and as a result of this, the Gearing Ratio increased to 23.4% as of December 31 2013, compared to 20.4% as of December 31 2012. Taking advantage of a window of high liquidity, we issued US$400 million of 10-year notes at a favourable coupon rate of 3.75% in January 2013 to diversify Champion REIT s sources of funding, lengthen debt maturity and lock in long term rates. Following this Medium Term Note issue and the refinancing of some low interest bank debt originating from 5 years ago, cash interest expenses increased from HK$143 million in 2012 to HK$251 million in 2013. While that has held back the distribution growth of the REIT for the short term, we believe the refinancing maneuvers we undertook in 2013 have significantly improved our funding risk profile and will help stabilize our long-term financing costs.
The appraised value of the REIT s properties is now HK$61,509 million, having risen HK$3.21 billion over the year. As part of the increase in asset value was due to the addition of the acquired Citibank Plaza floors which were largely funded through new debt liabilities, the Net Asset Value per Unit increased by a smaller degree, from HK$7.80 to HK$7.94 per Unit.
In the coming year, there should be some downside for the income of Citibank Plaza. Fortunately, strong rental growth at Langham Place should be able to counteract the potential weakness at Citibank Plaza for the near term. However, higher interest costs may once again hold back the growth in our Distributable Income. Champion REIT has HK$7 billion in bank loans due for refinancing in May 2014. While Hong Kong interbank borrowing rates remain low, the credit spread on this HK$7 billion will likely be higher upon refinancing. The Trust will continue to monitor various financing options to optimize our capital structure and funding costs. At the same time, we will continue to actively manage our two trophy assets to maximize rental income over the long term.
