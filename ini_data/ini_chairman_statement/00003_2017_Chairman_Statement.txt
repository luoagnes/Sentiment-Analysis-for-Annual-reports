Chairman’s
Statement
The Year’s Results
The Group’s town gas business in
Hong Kong maintained stable
growth in 2016. Global economic
fluctuations, slowdown in
economic growth in mainland
China, further devaluation of the
renminbi and low international oil
prices during the year, however,
impacted the Group’s utility and
emerging environmentally-friendly
energy businesses on the
mainland. Nevertheless, the
Group endeavoured to maintain
stability in its overall recurrent
business results for 2016.
Profit after taxation attributable
to shareholders of the Group
for the year increased by 0.53
per cent to HK$7,341 million,
an increase of HK$39 million
compared to 2015. Earnings
per share for the year amounted
to HK57.7 cents.
During the year under review, the
Group invested HK$6,257 million
in production facilities, pipelines,
plants and other fixed assets
for the sustainable development
of its various existing and new
businesses in Hong Kong and
mainland China.
Town Gas Business
in Hong Kong
The local economy grew slower
in 2016 compared to 2015 amid
a challenging global economy.
During the year, tourism was hit
by a strong Hong Kong dollar
causing a decrease in the total
number of inbound visitors for the
second consecutive year and thus
negatively impacting the food
and beverage gas sales market.
Conversely, as the average
temperature in Hong Kong in 2016
was lower than in 2015, residential
gas sales increased. Compared to 2015, total volume of gas sales in
Hong Kong for 2016 increased
by 1.4 per cent to 28,814 million
MJ while appliance sales revenue
increased by 24.9 per cent to
HK$1,634 million with a total
of 275,361 sets sold, mainly
benefiting from newly completed
residential projects.
As at the end of 2016, the number
of customers was 1,859,414, an
increase of 20,153 compared to
2015, slightly up by 1.1 per cent.
Business Development
in Mainland China
The Group’s mainland businesses
continued to progress steadily
during 2016. Overall, inclusive of
projects of the Group’s subsidiary,
Towngas China Company Limited
(“Towngas China”; stock code:
1083.HK), the Group had
241 projects on the mainland,
as at the end of 2016, 19 more
than at the end of 2015, spread
across 26 provinces, autonomous
regions and municipalities. These
projects encompass upstream,
midstream and downstream
natural gas sectors, water sectors,
efficient energy applications and
exploration and utilisation of
emerging environmentallyfriendly
energy, as well as
telecommunications.
The Group’s development of
emerging environmentally-friendly
energy businesses in mainland
China, including coalbed methane
liquefaction, coal chemicals,
conversion and utilisation of
biomass, natural gas refilling
stations, etc., through its
wholly-owned subsidiary ECO
Environmental Investments Limited
and the latter’s subsidiaries
(collectively known as “ECO”), is
progressing steadily. During 2016,
international oil prices continued
to fluctuate, falling at one time
early in the year, to a 2003 low,
leading to a drastic drop in prices
of energy products which
significantly affected ECO’s profits.
Nevertheless, ECO’s selfdeveloped
innovative technologies
progressed well in 2016. Gradual
commercial application of ECO’s
new technologies is expected to
contribute to long-term business
growth of the Group. Additionally,
international oil prices have
become more stable since the end
of 2016, and this will also help the
Group’s income growth.
Diversification and an increase in
the number of projects have
gradually transformed the Group
from a locally-based company in
Hong Kong centred on a single
town gas business into a sizable,
nation-wide, multi-business
corporation focused on
environmentally-friendly energy
ventures and utility sectors.
Utility Businesses
in Mainland China
The Group’s city-gas businesses
are progressing well. As at the end
of 2016, inclusive of Towngas
China, the Group had a total of
131 city-gas projects in mainland
cities spread across 23 provinces,
autonomous regions and
municipalities. The total volume of
gas sales for these projects in 2016
was approximately 17,140 million
cubic metres, an increase of
10.3 per cent over 2015. As at the
end of 2016, the Group’s mainland
gas customers stood at approximately
23.1 million, an increase of
11 per cent over 2015. The Group
continues to have a good
reputation as a large-scale city-gas
enterprise with outstanding
performance on the mainland.
Due to uncertainties over the
policy direction of a number of
major global economies resulting
in poor growth momentum,
demand for commodities
worldwide remained weak during
2016, and, as a result, growth in
the mainland economy slowed
compared to 2015. Exports from
mainland China have now declined
for two consecutive years. Cutting
excessive capacity, destocking and
deleveraging have also reduced
industrial production. Thus,
demand for energy across the
country, including electricity,
petroleum and natural gas, 
recorded only slight growth in
2016. Furthermore, given low
international oil prices, prices for
other petroleum fuels also
declined. Nevertheless, in the
medium to long term, as natural
gas is still projected to be the
clean energy of choice to best
reduce air pollution and improve
smoggy atmospheric conditions
on the mainland, long-term and
steady growth in demand is still
anticipated. The Chinese
government has also formulated
a natural gas utilisation policy to
strengthen preventative measures
to combat air pollution and to
minimise the formation of smog,
indicating an energy development
trend inclining towards natural
gas and environmentally-friendly
energy. The competitiveness of
natural gas relative to other
energy sources was also enhanced
following reductions in the
mainland’s non-residential natural
gas city-gate prices at the end
of 2015. This favourable
momentum will continue to
benefit the Group’s city-gas and
natural gas businesses.
In addition, with gradual
commissioning of large-scale
national natural gas projects,
including transmission pipelines
from Sichuan province to eastern
and southern China and the
West-to-East pipeline, and
projects for importing piped
natural gas from Central Asia
and Myanmar, together with a
scheduled supply of piped natural
gas from Russia, as well as a rise in
the sources of imported liquefied
natural gas (“LNG”), supply of
natural gas on the mainland is
becoming ample, which is
beneficial to market development.
With a number of mainland cities
gradually advocating the use of
natural gas to replace coal, natural
gas as a fuel for household
heating in winter is steadily
growing. Thus, with increasing
sources of gas supply, expanding
pipeline networks, rising living
standards and society’s aspiration
for greater environmental
protection, the Group anticipates
its mainland city-gas businesses
will continue to thrive in future.
Anhui Province Natural Gas
Development Co. Ltd., an
associated company of the Group,
was listed on the Shanghai Stock
Exchange on 10th January 2017.
As a large-scale integrated
operator, its core business is the
construction and operation of
long-haul natural gas pipelines
in Anhui province, alongside a
downstream distribution business.
Listing will help speed up the
company’s construction of natural
gas pipelines and its development
of markets in the province.
Construction of the Group’s
natural gas storage facility in
underground salt caverns in Jintan
district, Changzhou city, Jiangsu
province, is in progress. Upon
completion, this facility will be
the first of its kind developed by
a city-gas enterprise on the
mainland. Total storage capacity
will be approximately 460 million
standard cubic metres.
Completion of phase one of this
project, with a storage capacity of
150 million standard cubic metres,
is expected during the second
quarter of 2017. This facility, which
will help the Group supplement
and regulate gas supplies during
the peak winter period for several
of its city-gas projects in eastern
China, is in line with the Chinese
government’s policy of
advocating faster development
of gas storage capacity, and will
support the Group’s business
development in downstream
city-gas markets.
The Group’s development of
natural gas vehicular refilling
stations in mainland China, under
the brand name “Towngas”, is
progressing well with 109 stations
now spread across different
provinces to date. Apart from
this, the Group is also proactively
developing refilling projects for
marine vessels and is currently
investing in a joint venture
project, with six refilling sites,
for barges along the Yangtze
River in Jiangsu province. This is
the country’s first, and largest
project in terms of number of
refilling sites, along this river. 
In September 2013, the joint
venture constructed and put into
service the country’s first floating
LNG refilling station barge.
Classified by the government
as a pilot project, this venture
represents the start of a new era
for the mainland’s marine industry
in LNG applications. Given that
LNG is a form of clean energy
that is being actively promoted
by the Chinese government,
vehicular and marine refilling
station businesses have good
prospects for the Group.
The Group has entered into the
mainland water market under the
brand name “Hua Yan Water”
for over 11 years and currently
invests in, and operates, six water
projects. These include water
supply joint venture projects in
Wujiang district, Suzhou city,
Jiangsu province and in Wuhu
city, Anhui province; whollyowned
water supply projects in
Zhengpugang Xin Qu, Maanshan
city and in Jiangbei Xin Qu, Wuhu
city, both in Anhui province; and
an integrated water supply and
wastewater treatment joint
venture project, together with an
integrated wastewater treatment
joint venture project for a special
industry, both in Suzhou Industrial
Park, Suzhou city, Jiangsu
province. In addition, given food
waste processing and utilisation
is also a sizable environmentallyfriendly
industry, the Group is
constructing a plant in Suzhou
Industrial Park to handle 500 tonnes
of food waste, green waste
and landfill leachate daily for
conversion into natural gas, oil
products, solid fuel and fertilizers,
under the “Hua Yan Water”
brand; commissioning is expected
in the third quarter of 2018 and
will be the Group’s first project
converting waste into high-value
products.
Operation and management
of businesses encompassing
city-gas, midstream natural gas,
city-water and waste processing
and utilisation projects create
greater synergy and mutual
advantages. Furthermore, these
businesses generate a stable
income and provide good
environmental benefits, with
room for expansion. The Group
will therefore keep on looking
for opportunities to invest in
high-quality utility projects on
the mainland.
Emerging
Environmentally-Friendly
Energy Businesses
ECO’s major businesses in Hong
Kong – an aviation fuel facility,
dedicated liquefied petroleum
gas (“LPG”) vehicular refilling
stations and landfill gas utilisation
projects – all operated smoothly
in 2016. With a total turnover of
approximately 6.2 million tonnes
in 2016, ECO’s aviation fuel facility
provided a safe and reliable fuel
supply to Hong Kong International
Airport and contributed to ECO’s
steady profit growth. ECO’s LPG
vehicular refilling station business
had a steady operation and
satisfactory profit in 2016,
providing a quality and reliable
fuel supply to the territory’s taxi
and minibus sectors. ECO’s
landfill gas project in the North
East New Territories, after
operating for several years,
has been generating noticeable
environmental benefits. ECO’s
development of a South East New
Territories landfill gas utilisation
project is also progressing
smoothly, with commissioning
expected to start in the first half
of 2017. This will then further
increase the proportion of landfill
gas used by the Group and make
an additional contribution to
energy conservation and emission
reduction in Hong Kong.
With international oil prices
creeping low during most of 2016,
annual output of ECO’s oilfield
project in Thailand fell to
1.37 million barrels, causing
a significant impact on profit.
However, a rebound in
international oil prices to a range
of approximately USD55 per
barrel in late 2016 helps to
stabilise the business conditions
faced by the project. 
As smog and air pollution on
the mainland are now a growing
concern, the Chinese government
is stepping up its efforts to
promote the use of LNG to
gradually replace diesel as fuel
for heavy-duty trucks. ECO’s
networks of natural gas refilling
stations are gradually taking
shape in provinces and
autonomous regions including
Shaanxi, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia,
Shandong, Shanxi, Jiangsu,
Henan and Liaoning. All in all,
ECO currently has 62 refilling
stations in operation, under
construction or at the planning
stage. As expansion of its
networks progresses, the ECO
brand name will gradually become
more well-known in the market.
Conversion of biomass into clean
energy and chemical products
is an important part of ECO’s
business strategy which is in line
with the policy direction of
mainland China. To this end,
the plant now under construction
and located in Zhangjiagang city,
Jiangsu province can upgrade
approximately 220,000 tonnes of
palm acid oil, a low-quality
inedible bio-oil, into high-value
oleic acids and other chemical
products each year. Construction
is expected to be completed and
ready for trial production by the
third quarter of 2017. In addition,
construction of a project in
Xuzhou city, Jiangsu province to
produce LNG by methanation of
coke oven gas has been largely
completed; trial production is
expected to commence in the
first half of 2017.
Mainland China, a sizeable
agricultural country, generates
a large quantity of agricultural
waste every year. Apart from
using a small portion of this in
fields or for power generation,
there are currently no effective
measures to make good use of
the rest of this waste. However,
ECO’s research and development
team has successfully developed
a world leading approach
on pyrolysis and hydrolysis
technologies, which can convert
agricultural and forestry waste
into high-value syngas and green
block chemicals, such as furfural
and levulinic acid. To this end,
ECO has launched a pilot project
in Hebei province with trial
production expected to start in
the second half of 2017, the
success of which would pave the
foundation for subsequent
commercial implementation.
ECO’s coal chemical project in
Ordos city, Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, operated
smoothly during 2016 yielding
over 310,000 tonnes of methanol.
Works to upgrade and optimise
the facility to convert methanol
into natural gasoline are
progressing as planned.
Additionally, ECO has launched a
new project to convert 40 per cent
of the coal-based syngas into
120,000 tonnes of higher-valued
ethylene glycol, with trial
production targeted to start
before the end of 2017. These will
lay a solid foundation for ECO
to further broaden its businesses
on syngas utilisation and
methanol upgrading.
In line with its evolving business
development strategy, ECO
continues to strengthen its
capabilities in research and
technological development,
from the original technological
emphasis on fuel substitutes, now
extending to encompass higher
value-added chemical and new
material substitutes. These
include the conversion of hightemperature
coal tar oil into
pitch-based carbon materials,
low temperature carbonisation
of oil-rich powder coal, and
deep-processing of levulinic acid
to green fuel additives. A number
of breakthroughs have already
been achieved, and upon
commercial application of
technologies which can be
proceeded shortly, significant
economic and environmental
benefits could be derived. All
these successes will create a
significant competitive edge for
ECO’s future development. Towngas China
Company Limited
(Stock Code: 1083.HK)
Towngas China, a subsidiary of
the Group, recorded good growth
in profit after taxation attributable
to its shareholders, amounting to
HK$974 million in 2016, an increase
of approximately 21 per cent over
2015. As at the end of 2016, the
Group held approximately 1,739
million shares in Towngas China,
representing approximately
64.12 per cent of Towngas China’s
total issued shares.
Towngas China added two new
distributed energy projects to its
portfolio in 2016, one based in
Sichuan province, and the other
known as Towngas China Energy
Investment (Shenzhen) Limited.
Towngas China was honoured
with the Grand Award presented
by The Hong Kong Management
Association (“HKMA”) at its 2016
HKMA Quality Awards, in
recognition of the company’s
long-time commitment to quality.
The award is highly gratifying as
it affirms Towngas China’s
positive approach to total quality
management, enhancement of
performance across all its
operations, and quality products
and services. Towngas China’s
ongoing efforts to improve its
customer services, safety, human
resources, social responsibility,
corporate governance and
financial performance continue
to contribute to the Group’s
business growth momentum
and establishment of a good
corporate image.
During 2016, Moody’s Investors
Service maintained its issuer
credit rating on Towngas China
as “Baa1” with a “stable” outlook.
Standard & Poor’s Ratings
Services also upheld their “BBB+”
long-term corporate credit rating
and “cnA+” long-term Greater
China regional scale credit rating
on Towngas China with a “stable”
outlook. These two international
rating agencies’ ratings
demonstrate recognition of
Towngas China’s stable financial
status and reflect the company’s
increasing credit strength.
Financing Programmes
In order to tap funding in a timely
and flexible manner, the Group
established a medium term note
programme in 2009 under HKCG
(Finance) Limited, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Group. Taking
advantage of low interest rates,
medium term notes totalling
HK$1,328 million, with maturity
ranging from 10 to 12 years, were
issued during 2016. In line with
the Group’s long-term business
investments, as at 31st December
2016, the amount of medium
term notes issued had reached
HK$11.9 billion with tenors
ranging from 10 to 40 years,
with an average fixed interest
rate of 3.6 per cent and an
average tenor of 15.5 years.
Employees and
Productivity
As at the end of 2016, the number
of employees engaged in the
town gas business in Hong Kong
was 2,019 (2015 year end: 1,999),
the number of customers was
1,859,414, and each employee
served the equivalent of 921
customers, a similar level to 2015.
Inclusive of employees engaged
in local businesses such as
telecommunications, LPG
vehicular refilling stations and
engineering contractual works,
the total number of the Group’s
employees engaged in businesses
in Hong Kong was 2,392 as at the
end of 2016 compared to 2,380
as at the end of 2015. Related
manpower costs amounted to
HK$1,052 million for 2016. In 2016,
there was an approximately
4 per cent average increase in
remuneration over 2015. The
Group will continue to offer
employees rewarding careers
based on their capabilities and
performance and arrange a variety
of training programmes in order
to constantly enhance the quality
of the Group’s customer services.Exclusive of businesses in Hong
Kong, the total number of the
Group’s employees in mainland
China and other places outside
Hong Kong was 47,000 as at
the end of 2016, an increase of
approximately 1,400 compared
to 2015.
On behalf of the Board of
Directors, I would like to thank
all our employees for their
dedication and hard work in
creating value for shareholders
and customers.
Bonus Issue of Shares
The Directors propose to make a
bonus issue of one new share for
every ten existing shares held by
shareholders whose names are
on the Register of Members of the
Company as at 15th June 2017.
The necessary resolution will
be proposed at the forthcoming
Annual General Meeting
on 7th June 2017, and if passed,
share certificates will be posted
on 23rd June 2017.
Final Dividend
The Directors are pleased to
recommend a final dividend of
HK23 cents per share payable to
shareholders whose names are
on the Register of Members of the
Company as at 15th June 2017.
Including the interim dividend
of HK12 cents per share paid on
3rd October 2016, the total
dividend payout for the whole
year shall be HK35 cents per share.
Barring unforeseen circumstances,
the forecast dividends per share
for 2017 after bonus share issue
shall not be less than the interim
and final dividends for 2016.
Business Outlook for 2017
The Company predicts steady
growth in its number of customers
in Hong Kong during 2017. With
a small upturn in the total number
of inbound tourists in early 2017,
the retail market has now
improved slightly. The Group’s
gas business in Hong Kong is also
benefiting from the efforts of The
Government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region to
increase land and housing supply
which should help maintain stable
and good growth in the number
of gas customers in the next few
years. Additionally, town gas
competitiveness as an energy
resource combining both
environmental and economic
advantages is helping to develop
the commercial and industrial
energy market. Due to the impact
of international oil prices, gas
tariff fuel cost adjustment
charges have been reduced
which is beneficial to customers
and further enhances the
competitiveness of town gas,
relative to electricity in particular,
in the energy market. However,
uncertainties in international
politics and the world economy
have created variables in Hong
Kong’s economic development
this year. Moreover, increasing
local manpower costs and
operating expenses are leading
to rising costs for businesses in
Hong Kong generally. The
business environment is full of
challenges. The Company will,
however, continue to enhance
operational efficiency so as to
maintain stable development of
its gas business in the territory.
Development of export
manufacturing industries in
mainland China is being
negatively affected by
uncertainties in both the
global economy and the policy
direction of a number of major
economies. This, combined with
other factors including the
mainland’s slow economic growth
momentum, is adversely
impacting industrial gas demand.
Thus, growth in gas sales of the
Group’s mainland city-gas
businesses is weakening. Coupled
with the exchange rate risk arising
from renminbi devaluation,
overall profit growth of the
Group’s mainland businesses
faces challenges in the near term.
Nevertheless, in the long term,
the Chinese government’s move
to improve smoggy atmospheric
conditions, thus tightening
supervision and administration of
related measures and enhancing
efforts to reduce carbon
emissions and encouraging the
use of clean energy, is creating
opportunities for natural gas to 
replace use of coal in industrial
processing, as well as in boilers,
power generation, distributed
energy, household heating, gas
hot water heaters and clothes
dryers. Natural gas price
adjustments in late 2015 lowered
upstream gas prices, thus enhancing
competitiveness. Furthermore,
increasing upstream gas supply,
expanding pipeline networks and
rapid urbanisation leading to a
continuous rise in demand for
utility facilities and energy, are
all favourable to the development
of the downstream gas market
and the healthy and long-term
development of the natural gas
business sector in general.
In respect of emerging
environmentally-friendly energy
businesses, following the Chinese
government’s move towards
greater energy diversification,
environmental protection and
recycling of materials, the Group
is continuing to develop and
apply new technologies for
conserving energy and reducing
pollutant emissions. There is
also a growing trend for greater
use of low-sulfur, high-quality oil,
electricity and natural gas as fuels
for vehicles and vessels to reduce
atmospheric pollution. Though
international oil prices have
recently rebounded from their
lowest point in early 2016, it is
necessary to closely monitor
potential market volatility, as
this will still impact profit growth
and slow down the pace of
investment of the Group’s
emerging environmentally-friendly
energy businesses in the short
term. ECO is moving towards
production of high-quality
chemical products which are less
sensitive to international oil
prices, taking this as a guide for
future project investments.
As self-developed research and
developments gradually achieve
results which will be put into
commercial production, emerging
environmentally-friendly energy
businesses will ignite a new light
for the Group, illuminating the
way for long-term development
and business growth strategy.
With the Group’s solid foundation
in Hong Kong and its diverse
business sectors spread across
extensive areas on the mainland,
together with its successful
technical experience and corporate
brand names and sales channels
built there over 22 years, alongside
society’s growing concern over air
quality, it is anticipated that there
will be ever-rising demand for
clean energy. According to the
Thirteenth Five-Year Plan,
the share of natural gas in the
country’s total energy mix is set
to increase from below 6 per cent
currently to 10 per cent by year
2020, thus creating huge market
potential for clean energy
businesses. In addition, given
that the number of piped-gas
customers in Hong Kong and
mainland China is increasing, the
Group, with its sizeable customer
base, foresees better benefits
from its expanding new businesses.
Despite the challenges resulting
from the slowdown in economic
growth on the mainland,
the Group has formulated, and is
gradually implementing, plans
in accordance with the country’s
energy and environmental
policies. Overall, with demand for
natural gas and environmentallyfriendly
and renewable energy
increasing alongside society’s
growing aspiration for more
environmental protection, coupled
with the Group’s drive to promote
an innovative mindset to
continually add new momentum
to its business growth, the Group
anticipates development in the
years to come will be ever
broader and better.
