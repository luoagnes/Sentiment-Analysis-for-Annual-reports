Chairman s Statements 
On behalf of Haitian International Holdings Limited, ( Haitian Holdings or the Company ), with its subsidiaries (together, the Group ), I am pleased to present the Group s annual results for the year ended 31 December 2009.

Following the outbreak of the global financial crises in the fourth quarter of 2008, year 2009 began with a sharp decline in sales and orders. The operating environment improved since the second quarter of 2009 due to massive stimulus packages implemented by governments worldwide. With the launch of the Chinese Government RMB four-trillion Economic Stimulus Package and the national plans for readjustment and revitalization of key industries, China was one of the first economies to recover from the impact of the financial crises. The financial crisis has driven the focus of the plastic injection moulding machine manufacturing industry in the world to the China market. The Chinese market demonstrated an impressive and sustained recovery since the second quarter of 2009. As market conditions gradually stabilized in other parts of the world, the pace of our sales recovery from the second quarter onwards was so remarkable that it turned around the shortfall of sales in the first half of 2009. Total sales in the second half of 2009 was up 80.8% compared to the first half. Consequently, the Group achieved turnover of RMB3,861.3 million in 2009, representing an increase of 4.5% compared with RMB3,694.4 million in 2008.

The Group s sales by geographic areas are summarized in the following table: (RMB million) 1H2008 2H2008 2008 1H2009 2H2009 2009 09 Vs 08

Domestic Sales 1,348.9 914.1 2,263.0 1,011.2 1,905.7 2,916.9 28.9% 88.5% Export Sales 667.4 676.1 1,343.5 313.6 527.5 841.1 -37.4% 68.2% Parts 43.7 44.2 87.9 50.2 53.1 103.3 17.5% 5.8% 2,060.0 1,634.4 3,694.4 1,375.0 2,486.3 3,861.3 4.5% 80.8% Boosted by the execution of the RMB four-trillion Economic Stimulus Package and the plans to resuscitate key industries in China, domestic demand for properties and motor vehicles increased substantially. Demand for the relevant plastic consumer products also showed a remarkable increase, which posted an impressive growth and thus brought the sequential improvement in investor confidence. Since the Value-Added Tax (VAT) reform that allows companies to deduct 17% VAT for fixed assets purchased, corporate investment in equipment in China has been encouraged and the replacement cycle of equipment has been shortened. Therefore, we recorded an impressive sales growth of 28.9% for the domestic market amounting to RMB2,916.9 million in 2009.
Even though there appeared to be signs of economic stabilization and recovery in the export markets since the second half of 2009, the levels of intensity and paces for China were unmatched. The economic revival in other parts of the world was still at a preliminary stage. Our export sales in the second half of 2009 were up 68.2% compared to the first half, yet the results were still approximately 20% lower than the pre-crisis level. Consequently, the overall export sales recorded a decline of 37.4% and amounted to RMB841.1 million for the year.

The Group s sales by small tonnage and medium-to-large tonnage plastic injection moulding machines (PIMMs) are summarized in the following table: (RMB million) 1H2008 2H2008 2008 1H2009 2H2009 2009 09 Vs 08

Small tonnage 1,280.1 948.8 2,228.9 956.1 1,668.7 2,624.8 17.8% 74.5% Medium-to-large tonnage 736.2 641.4 1,377.6 368.7 764.5 1,133.2 -17.7% 107.4% Parts 43.7 44.2 87.9 50.2 53.1 103.3 17.5% 5.8% 2,060.0 1,634.4 3,694.4 1,375.0 2,486.3 3,861.3 4.5% 80.8% During the year under review, the sales of small-tonnage PIMMs increased by 17.8% and the sales of medium-to-large-tonnage PIMMs decreased by 17.7%. Generally, the sales of small tonnage PIMMs are usually more sensitive and response faster to change in market situation. Riding on the gradual market improvement, the small-tonnage PIMMs showcased a strong recovery in the beginning of the second quarter. Coupled with a significant market share gain from Mars (J5 series), of which PIMMs come with strong energy-saving and higher-precision features, the sales of small-tonnage PIMMs surged by 17.8% amounting to RMB2,624.8 million in 2009.
Due to the longer delivery time lag of medium-to-large-tonnage PIMMs, the sales improvement could only be realized starting from the third quarter. The sales of medium-to-large-tonnage PIMMs in the second half was up by a remarkable 107.4% against the first half. Despite the robust results, which were approximately 5% higher than the pre-crisis level, overall sales of this category still decreased by 17.7% year-over-year.
In year 2009, our profitability also improved. Our continuous efforts in implementation of cost control measures and optimization in production process to lower the production and logistic costs, coupled with correction in raw material and component costs after the financial crisis, all contributed to the Group s net profit margin improvement from 11.0% in 2008 to 11.7% in 2009. The Group s profit attributable to equity holders for year 2009 is RMB450.0 million, which is 11.0% higher than that of 2008.

Medium-to-large Tonnage Machine Analysis 
For Haitian International, 2009 was a difficult but rewarding year. Although 2009 was not one of our most profitable years, we achieved a record setting half-yearly sales and profit in the second half of 2009. Our success is not only built on the stabilization of market environment in 2009, but also on the long-term strategy of expanding our product penetration in different industries and markets, as well as persistent efforts in research and development of innovative and affordable products to cater to customer needs.
It is also the result of the Company s effort of diversification and adjustment to the sales network area during the financial crisis. Our diversified customer portfolio allowed us to be more resilient to the market downturn and avoid unnecessary scale-down of business caused by short-term adjustment to market conditions. We are in an unrivaled position to benefit from opportunities arising from the strong market recovery. With our ace-product, Mars (J5), which currently accounted for more than 50% of our total sales, we gained a remarkable market share from other industry players during the recovery. During the year, the sales of Mars increased by 104.9% from RMB1,016.5 million in 2008 to RMB2,082 million in 2009. Continuous increase in the sales ratio of the Mars machine is also due to its compliance with the macro policy of low-carbon, energy saving and environmental-friendly promoted by the PRC government. As a result, we have significantly outperformed our industry players as the PIMM market improved.

We believes that the worst of the financial crises is over and the global economy is on the right track to a sustainable recovery. There is a clear sign of continued economic recovery from recent economic data, which indicated the rebound in global manufacturing activities, stabilization of unemployment rate and improved consumer sentiment and investment confidence. The pace and scale of recovery vary in different countries. It is very clear that the growth rate of the PRC economy will take the lead against the rest of the world. With more than 70% of sales in domestic market, we will be in a prime position to benefit from the economic growth. In the second half of 2009, our export sales resumed to approximately 80% against the normal level. As other countries started gaining momentum, we expect a full recovery of export business to be witnessed in 2010.
Business momentum for our sales in the first two months of 2010 remained encouraging. Despite the usual low level of sales activities during the Chinese New Year holidays, the billing and delivery of PIMMs for the first two months reached RMB863.3 million, setting a new record for the same period. With sales activities being well-above the pre-crisis period, we have already returned back to the growth phase and expect to record another year of strong performance compared to past record-breaking 
With the ambition in future growth, we cannot disregard that there remains some fragility in the economic outlook and we need to be cautious dealing with uncertainties, including possible hiking of steel and component costs, timing of fiscal policy adjustments in response to inflation and overheat economy, and possible sovereign-debt crunch in certain EU nations. We have established a track record of steady growth as well as the capability to overcome challenges and difficulties, such as that of the recent financial crisis.
Leveraging on our prestigious brand, unmatched quality, self-developed core technology and efficient production scale, we are confident to create much higher value in the production process than industry peers and maintain satisfactory profitability in this environment. Building on our strong performance in 2009 and our past efforts in consolidating our businesses, we are well-prepared to reach new heights in the future.

Finally, on behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to thanks all staff members for their contribution in the past year and at the same time, I would also like to express our gratitude towards our shareholders, consumers, suppliers and business partners for their continued confidence in and support to the Group.
