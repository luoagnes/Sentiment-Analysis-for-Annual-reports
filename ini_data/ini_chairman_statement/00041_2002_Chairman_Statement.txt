2001 turned out to be a challenging year for the Group s businesses. However, coupled with lower interest rates, CHAIRMAN S STATEMENT 
The Board has resolved to recommend to Shareholders at the forthcoming 2002 Annual General Meeting (the 2002 AGM ) the payment of a final dividend of HK14 cents per share for the year ended 31st December 2001 (2000: HK20 cents per share), to be satisfied by way of a scrip dividend with a cash option, to Shareholders whose names appear on the Register of Members on 9th May 2002. Together with the interim dividend of HK7 cents per share paid on 23rd October 2001, on the assumption that every Shareholder elects to receive all final dividend in cash, the total dividend for the full year will be HK21 cents per share (2000: HK30 cents per share), amounting to not less than HK$121,205,158 (2000: HK$165,633,965).
Subject to the approval of Shareholders at the 2002 AGM and the Listing Committee of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited granting listing of and permission to deal in the new shares to be allotted and issued pursuant to the proposed distribution of a scrip dividend mentioned herein, each Shareholder will be allotted fully-paid shares having an aggregate market value equal to the total amount which such Shareholder could elect to receive in cash and will be given the option to elect to receive payment partly or wholly in cash instead of the allotment of shares. Dividend warrants and share certificates in respect of the proposed dividend are expected to be despatched to Shareholders on or about 6th June 2002. Full details of the scrip dividend will be set out in a letter to be sent to Shareholders together with a form of election for cash soon after the 2002 AGM.
CLOSURE OF TRANSFER BOOKS The Register of Members of the Company will be closed from Thursday, 2nd May 2002 to Thursday, 9th May 2002, both days inclusive, during which period no share transfers will be effected.

1. Rental Properties Total net rental income increased 6.55% to HK$764.5 million in 2001 from HK$717.5 million in 2000. The income for 2001 was boosted by 6 months of contribution from additional space acquired in Citibank Plaza in June 2001 and sharply higher income from our U.S. office portfolio. On a same-asset basis, the income from our Hong Kong rental properties actually 
Hong Kong Rental Properties (a)Acquisition of additional office space in 
On 28th June 2001, we completed the purchase of 39 - 50F of Citibank Tower (comprising 232,501 gross sq. ft. of office space), together with a shop and some carparking spaces, based on a valuation of HK$1,951.56 million. HK$300.06 million of the purchase consideration was satisfied by issuance of new shares of Great Eagle Holdings Limited at a price of HK$18 per share. The entire area was leased to Citibank and another major financial institution for about 3 years from the date of acquisition, generating a yield of 6.8%.
Hong Kong & Overseas 
The Hong Kong Grade-A office market saw rising vacancy rates 
U.S. Rental Properties Our office portfolio in the United States showed significantly better results in 2001. The negative effect of the downturn in the U.S. economy occurred late in the second half of the year and therefore did not immediately register material impact on the portfolio during 2001. A near full-year contribution by the high-yielding 150 Spear Street, San Francisco, which was acquired in January 2001 and replaced the much lower-yielding Metropolitan Tower in New York sold in December 2000, resulted in a substantial increase in income from the U.S.
portfolio in 2001.
In August 2001, we disposed of Pacific Wilshire Plaza in Los Angeles at a consideration of US$32.9 million. A modest profit was recorded.
The softening of the U.S. office market will likely continue into the early part of 2002 and lower occupancy rates are anticipated. However, because only 20% of the portfolio s leases are scheduled to expire in 2002, the negative impact should not be 
Notwithstanding one of the lowest level of new supply in 15 years, the Hong Kong Grade-A office market saw rising vacancy rates in 2001, resulting from negative absorption largely associated with downsizing in the financial and information- technology industries. Occupancy rates of offices in both Citibank Plaza and Great Eagle Centre decreased moderately. Rentals for Grade-A offices also came under increasing pressure as the year progressed, especially after the September 11 event.
By year-end 2001, effective rent rates had fallen roughly 30% from the level at the beginning of the 
The softening trend continued into early 2002 though the number of enquiries has been on the increase, indicative of the underlying demand, alongside some bargain hunting activities.
Hong Kong & Overseas 
The event of September 11 adversely affected performance of hotels in Hong Kong and overseas.
2. Hotels and Furnished Apartments Total revenue of the Group s hotels and furnished apartments for 2001 amounted to HK$1,552.7 million, representing HK$404.3 million and HK$1,148.4 million from Hong Kong and overseas operations respectively. Total EBITDA amounted to HK$460.6 million for 2001 as compared with HK$548.7 million for 2000.
Hong Kong Operations The Hong Kong hotel industry was adversely affected in the last year by various negative factors while it was adjusting to a structural transformation in the general economy. Tourist arrivals had been moving up nicely in the first three quarters of 2001 though much of the growth was driven by Mainland China arrivals.
Downward pressure on rates exerted by the limited number of permitted suppliers of this market has continued to limit the profitability from this growth to hotels in Hong Kong.
The event of September 11 had an immediate negative effect on general arrivals ex-China, particularly business arrivals in the last four months of the year, leading to lower occupancy and room rates.
CHAIRMAN S STATEMENT Great Eagle Hotel, Hong Kong The Great Eagle Hotel, which has continued to be well received in the 5 star market as a worthy independent product despite difficulties caused by the financial downturn and September 11 incident, was able to achieve an overall occupancy of 78.8% in 2001 (83.4% in 2000) with an increase in average room rate to HK$828.5 from HK$798.5 in 2000.
Eaton Hotel, Hong Kong Operating with a strong appeal to regional leisure travellers looking for comfortable value but affordable prices, this hotel still managed to maintain its market position, finishing the year with occupancy of 84.6% (88.5% in 2000) and average room rate of HK$426.0 (HK$436.0 in 
Eaton House Furnished Apartment, Hong Kong Due to a softer rental market and increases in supply, Eaton House s occupancy declined to 75.3% in 2001 from last year s 85%. Total revenue dropped to HK$34.6 million as compared with HK$37.2 million in 2000.

The Langham Hilton, London The effects of the downturn in financial markets from early 2001 were further exacerbated in London s deluxe hotels performance, first by the Foot-and-Mouth epidemics that devastated leisure and summer traffic to the UK and secondly by the September 11 event which temporarily halted much of the financial and commercial travel in the final quarter.
Although the rooms inventory in 2001 was enlarged by the addition of 47 Concierge Club rooms in mid 2000, the hotel finished the year at 67.8% occupancy and average room rate of 158.8, down from 77.5% and 175.8 in 2000. A further enhancement of approximately two thirds of the standard rooms was completed in 2001, which should improve the hotel s 5 star standard as business returns to more normal patterns in 2002.
Delta Chelsea Hotel, Toronto The hotel s performance has held up relatively well despite the US economic downturn and September 11 incident by gaining local market share over its competitors. It achieved an average occupancy of 72.8% and average room rate of C$138.7, compared to 74.8% and C$137.8 
Sheraton Towers Southgate Hotel, Melbourne Despite the collapse during 2001 of Australia s second largest domestic airline, Ansett, which has negatively impacted the local tourism industry, the hotel managed to maintain occupancy at 72.7% compared to last year s 74.2%. Average room rate finished at A$223.1 from A$238.0 last year.
Hotel Le Meridien, Boston Most severely impacted by the downturn of the US economy and the September 11 incident, the hotel s occupancy and average room rate have dropped to 64.8% and US$236.1 from 76.8% and US$260.9 in 2000 but remain in line with the overall market. Boston has started a slow recovery these last months in line with other major U.S. centers, but continuing improvements will depend on the US financial recovery over the next year.
Sheraton Auckland Hotel and Towers, Auckland Further expansion of the serviced apartment inventory in Auckland in 2001, which competes directly with hotels on daily lettings, along with the effects of September 11 on travel patterns, has continued to add to rate cutting citywide throughout this year. Average room rate has slipped to NZ$141.8 from last year s NZ$159.2.
However, increased room demand in the first three quarters has improved the overall occupancy in 2001 to 68.1% from last year s 
3. Properties Under Development 
Almost all of the foundation works at this 1.76 million sq. ft. retailofficehotel complex were completed in November 2001 after delay due to difficult site conditions, with minor outstanding works due to be completed by the end of March 2002. The main contract for construction of the sub-structure and super-structure were awarded in December 2001 and the related works have commenced. Target occupancy date of the entire project remains the end of 2003.
To further enhance the appeal of the project, an internationally renowned firm of architects has been retained to advise on the design of the 586,000 sq. ft. retail component of the project.
This integrated complex, by virtue of its magnitude and world-class design, will become a landmark for Mongkok and the focus of commercial and retailing activities in the area.
The total expenditure incurred in relation to the project, including interest capitalised, amounted to HK$6,699.6 million as of year end 2001. Out of the HK$5,100 million six-year term loan arranged to finance the project, HK$4,030 million remained available for drawing as at 31st December 2001 and should be sufficient to fund the project to completion.

We wrote off in 2001 HK$23 million representing all of our remaining unlisted investments in this segment, which prospects remain highly uncertain. We have no further exposure in respect of these investments.

Hong Kong s housing market was sluggish during 2000, adversely affecting the performance of Toptech Co. Limited. Revenue from sales of building and architectural products decreased 17% to HK$177.3 million. However as a result of effective cost and overheads control, the net contribution of the business declined 
To finance the HK$1,951 million acquisition price of the additional Citibank Tower office space in June 2001, we raised HK$1,075 million in syndicated bank loan. The balance was funded by new equity issuance of HK$300 million and drawdown of available liquidity. During the year, a mortgage loan of HK$601.2 million equivalent was also taken out to fund the acquisition of 150 Spear Street, San Francisco at a cost of HK$779.2 million equivalent.
Consolidated Net Attributable Debt outstanding (net of cash balances and debt attributable to minority interests) as of 31st December 2001 was HK$11,076 million, an increase of HK$2,170 million over that at year end 2000. The increased borrowings were mainly related to the acquisition of additional space in Citibank Tower and 150 Spear Street, with the rest being Mongkok project expenditures.
Consolidated Net Asset Value, based on independent valuation of the Group s investment properties and other assets at cost, amounted to HK$15,123 million as of 31st December 2001, a decrease of HK$2,379 million from that of year end 2000. The decline in NAV was in line with the general decline in value of commercial and hotel properties both locally and overseas. The resulting gearing ratio at 31st December 2001 was 73%.
With HK$ interest rates trending lower throughout 2001, all of our HK$ borrowings on floating-rate basis for most of the year, we were able to achieve significant savings in 2001. Towards the latter part of the year, when interest rates reached attractive levels, we proceeded to hedge part of our interest rate exposure by way of medium-term swaps. As at 31st December 2001, we had outstanding interest rate swap contracts with total notional principal of HK$2,420 million, representing approximately 28% of our HK$-denominated debts.
Our foreign currency debts, taken out to finance our overseas hotels and U.S. office properties, amounted to the equivalent of HK$3,676 million as of 31st December 2001. Of this, HK$1,474 million, or 40% of our foreign currency debts, were on fixed-rate basis. In conjunction with renewal of some of the loan facilities, the related fixed rates will likely be re-pegged at lower levels.

The net finance cost incurred during 2001 was HK$427.3 million, almost unchanged from the HK$426.1 million recorded in 2000. Substantially lower interest rates had more or less offset the effects of the higher debt level arising from property acquisitions. In addition, HK$244.2 million of finance cost relating to the Mongkok Project was capitalized, down from HK$424.3 million for 2000.
Lower interest rates were a key factor. The 2000 figure also included a one-time charge of HK$101 million, representing up-front loan arrangement 
Liquidity and Debt Maturity Profile As of 31st December 2001, we had cash, bank deposits and secured but undrawn loan facilities totalling HK$5,554.3 million. The vast majority of our loan facilities are medium-term in nature and are secured by properties with a comfortable value coverage. Their continuing availability is therefore well assured. The following is a profile of the maturity of our outstanding debts as of 31st 
Within 1 year 17.8% 1 - 2 years 13.8% 3 - 5 years 58.8% More than 5 years 9.6% 
Convertible bonds in the equivalent of HK$1.2 billion were redeemed in full upon their maturity in 
Pledge of Assets At 31st December 2001, the Group s properties with a total carrying value of approximately HK$27,773 million (2000: HK$27,918 million) together with assignments of sales proceeds, insurance proceeds, rental income, revenues and all other income generated from the relevant properties and deposits of approximately HK$95.4 million (2000: HK$104.2 million) were mortgaged or pledged to secure credit facilities granted to the Group.
Commitments and Contingent Liabilities 
At 31st December 2001, the Group had commitments and contingent liabilities not provided for in these financial statements, as 
(a) estimated expenditure in respect of property under development amounting to approximately HK$3,706.7 million (2000: HK$3,954.9 million) of which approximately HK$3,255.3 million (2000: HK$468.6 million) were contracted for; (b) authorised capital expenditure amounting to approximately HK$43.5 million (2000: HK$716.3 million) of which approximately HK$18.8 million (2000: HK$629.4 million) were contracted for; and (c) commitments under foreign exchange future contracts to sell approximately HK$143.9 million (2000: HK$879.1 million) at fixed exchange rates.

At 31st December 2001, the Company had issued corporate guarantees to certain banks in respect of credit facilities drawn by its subsidiaries amounting to approximately HK$9,248 million (2000: 
Other than set out above, the Group and the Company did not have any significant commitments and contingent liabilities at 31st 
It is unlikely that there will be any significant improvement in operating conditions for our office and hotel businesses in the first half of 2002.
However there are early signs that the U.S.
economy may be on a recovery path. Such recovery should have favourable implications on the global economy in the second half of the year.
The present weakness in the Hong Kong office market has largely been the result of a contraction in demand. Unlike the previous market trough of 199899, when unprecedented large supplies of new office space drove down the market, the supply of office space in the next few years will be way below historical average levels. The new completion pipeline will be particularly short in 2004 and 2005.
Subsequent to September 11, many multinational corporations have downsized to the bare-bone. Once the economic recovery takes hold, it should result in a sharp rebound in demand for prime office space in Hong Kong.
Recent statistics have shown a bounce back in tourist arrivals in Hong Kong. With the loosening of tourist travel restrictions from the Mainland, these increasingly affluent Mainland travellers should provide a welcome boost in demand for hotel rooms in Hong Kong. Occupancy at our two Hong Kong hotels has held up very well even in this down market. There should be room for better pricing as demand increases in the coming year. Our international hotels are all located in prime districts in major cities. Their business should also benefit from a global economic recovery as most of them are business travel oriented.
In the mean time we will focus on development of the Mongkok project. While prudently managing the costs of this landmark development, we are committed to delivering a high level of quality that will make this one of the most exciting retail, hotel and office complexes in Hong Kong.

The total number of employees in the Group was 2,656 as of 31st December 2001. In addition to salary payment, other benefits include discretionary bonus, education allowance, insurance, medical scheme and provident fund schemes. Certain terms of the Executive Share Option Scheme adopted in June 1999, in which senior employees (including executive directors) are entitled to participate, were amended on 20th December 2001 with the name of this share option scheme changed to Great Eagle Holdings Limited Share Option Scheme.
Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to address my sincere gratitude to my fellow Directors for their guidance and to all staff members for their hard-work contributed to the Group in the past year.
