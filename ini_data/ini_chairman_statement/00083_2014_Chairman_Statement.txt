The Group s retail portfolio in Hong Kong recorded good rental growth with overall occupancy rate increasing to approximately 98% for the financial year 20132014 from 97% for the last financial year, mainly due to stable economic conditions and continuous growth in inbound visitors.

(6) china Business 
Urbanisation in China has been an integral part of its economic development. The economic benefits derived from movement of human capital have contributed to China s rapid economic growth since the economy took off in the mid-1980s. Over the past three decades, urbanisation has been one of the key focuses for the Central Government in setting economic policy and objectives.
With both global and local economies changing over time, a comprehensive policy framework for urbanisation is needed. It will narrow rural-urban inequalities and reduce wealth disparities. The reforms proposed by the new government cover a broad spectrum of areas. Improvements in Hukou (household registration) system, property rights and land title registration system will facilitate the mobility of workers across China and safeguard the interests of the owners of the properties. Easing of one-child policy will also increase demand for consumer products, education as well as housing. Reforms in public finance, the banking system and capital markets including liberalization of interest rates and better access to housing finance are all important to establish a more sustainable consumption-led economy. These reforms are conducive to developing a healthy property market.

Throughout the years, the Group has completed a number of projects in Xiamen, Fuzhou and the first phase of its residential project in Zhangzhou. The experience gained from developing and leasing projects in China has also built the Group s execution capability in the country. The Group s projects are situated in cities with good economic and demographic fundamentals. The major property developments, namely The Palazzo in Chengdu, The Coronation in Chongqing and Dynasty Park in Zhangzhou will be sold and completed in phases over the next few years.

Other than the matters mentioned above, there has been no material change from the information published in the report and accounts for the financial year ended 30th June, 2013.

chairman s statement (Continued) 
prospects (Continued) Overall financial conditions in Euro zone have stabilised, but economies remain vulnerable with high unemployment, excess production capacity and deflationary pressure in a number of its member countries. In response to the situation, European Central Bank has lowered interest rates, imposed negative rates on overnight deposits from banks for the first time and provided banks with new long-term funds. It has also started the lending programme of Targeted Long Term Refinancing Operations alongside with other stimulus measures to increase bank lending and to drive economic growth in the years to come.
China s economy has been growing steadily. Economic, financial and social reforms covering a wide range of areas will lead the economy and society towards a more healthy and sustainable development. As the economic growth in the U.S. continues to strengthen, exports from China should continue to pick up.
Combined with the economic forces of domestic consumption-led growth, the gain in momentum in China s economy will have a positive effect on the Hong Kong economy which in turn is supportive to a better business environment for Hong Kong. Economic growth in Hong Kong has been stable with low unemployment and a healthy and prudent financial system.
The Hong Kong property market has been going through a period of change as a result of economic and property-related policies. In February 2014, Legislative Council passed the Stamp Duty (Amendments) Ordinance 2014 in relation to the implementation of Buyer s Stamp Duty and Special Stamp Duty. An amendment to the Double Stamp Duty passed in July 2014 has helped to improve buying sentiment as more projects were launched to market for sale. Primary transaction volume has recently recovered, but with rising construction costs and the property- related policies, there remain sensitivities in the Hong Kong property market.
Management will closely monitor the situation and will be responsive to market changes. The Group s recurrent businesses, which comprise property leasing, hospitality and property management services, continue to be resilient. With a good financial position, the Group is well-positioned to respond to challenges 
Management will continue to optimise earnings, enhance efficiency and productivity and improve the quality of products and services. In respect of property development and property management, the Group will incorporate more environmentally friendly elements in our projects. The Group will maintain a policy of selectively and continuously replenishing its land bank, which will enable it to strengthen earnings and shareholders value.

On behalf of the Board, I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation to all staff for their commitment, dedication and continuing support.
I would also like to express my gratitude to my fellow Directors for their guidance and wise counsel.
