Chairman s Statement 
The Group continued to encounter fierce market competition during the year under review. With the rising production costs, profit margin of the Group was further tapered.
Facing the stringent conditions, the Group has formulated a number of measures to strengthen profitability and also our ability to create value for our shareholders. In order to improve overall efficiency of the Group s production facilities and to reduce production overhead costs, the Group decided to cease all manufacturing operations in its Shenzhen factory in the third quarter of the financial year with all production lines relocated to the Group s two nearby factories in Changan, Dongguan. Although the decision has resulted in additional one-off costs including the write-off of materials and equipment, redundancy of labors and relocation of facilities, we consider the move beneficial to the future prospect of the Group as a whole.
In addition to streamlining operating procedures, the Group will strive to further enhance value-added activities, redesign products and develop new product lines so as to minimize production and administration costs.
Furthermore, with an ultimate goal to strengthen the Group s financial position, we target to further enhance our capital base, diversify investment on projects with high profit making potential, sustain our growth momentum and also broaden revenue stream of the Group.

I would like to take this opportunity to deliver my most sincere gratitude to the board of directors, the management team and all staff, for their devoted commitments in fostering the Group into one of the leading 
On behalf of the Group, I would also like to dedicate my special thanks to our shareholders, bankers, investors, vendors and customers for their enduring trusts and supports. We will focus on creating greater values for our customers with the provision of high quality products and services while also target at creating values for our shareholders through taking proactive business initiatives.
