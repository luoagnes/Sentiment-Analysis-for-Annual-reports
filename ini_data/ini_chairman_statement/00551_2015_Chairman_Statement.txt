I am pleased to present the annual results of Yue Yuen Industrial (Holdings) Limited (the Company and together with its subsidiaries, the Group ) for the financial year ended December 31, 2014 to the shareholders of the Company (the Shareholders ).

Developments in the world economy in 2014 were mixed. Overall, the global economic growth remained below the pace of expansion enjoyed over an extended period up to 2008. Growth in major economies has increasingly diverged, as the recovery in the United States gained momentum but Europe and Japan lagged behind. China was still growing at a robust pace but continues on a path of gradual deceleration. In addition, mixed central bank actions of different countries, as well as the rise in geopolitical risks, further contributed to the volatile global economic environment. Despite the volatile economic environment in 2014, the Group was still able to deliver solid performance for both footwear manufacturing and China retail businesses.

Financial year 2014 was a challenging year for the Group, in particular for the footwear manufacturing business, as the operating environment presented more complex and rapid changes. The cost structures in the Group s major manufacturing regions continue to rise significantly. Furthermore, the operating environment for the Group s manufacturing activities in China became even more challenging as factors, such as government policies and labor force structure, which were favorable to manufacturing activities have changed, and at a rapid pace. In response to the challenges, the Group has adjusted business strategies accordingly and accelerated the implementation of such strategies. The Group 
has continued to place more strategic emphasis on supply chain value creation, in addition to production economies of scale. The Group is focused on upgrading its capabilities to offer more valuable manufacturing and supply chain solutions to our brand customers, particularly in China where the Group can further leverage the potential synergies between the footwear manufacturing and retail 
In 2014, the Group achieved growth in sales in both footwear manufacturing and retail businesses, when compared to the financial year ended December 31, 2013. Consolidated turnover of the Group increased by 5.7% to US$8,013.4 million, compared to US$7,582.5 million recorded in the financial year 2013. The consolidated net profit attributable to equity holders of the Company decreased by 23.9% to US$331.0 million compared to US$ 434.8 million earned in year 2013. The decline in net profit was mainly due to rising input costs in China. When looking at the Group s listed subsidiary Pou Sheng International (Holdings) Limited ( Pou Sheng ), which is involved in the retail and brand licensee business in China, it was able to achieve sales of US$1,980.6 million, an increase of 11.4% compared to that recorded in the financial year 2013. Pou Sheng generated net profit attributable to its equity holders of US$4.6 million, an improvement as compared to the financial year 2013 which had a net loss of US$38.7 million. The improvement in Pou Sheng s performance is a reflection of the stabilizing sportswear retail environment in China and as a result of the strategic measures implemented by the Pou Sheng s management.

Annual Report 2014 
8 Yue Yuen Industrial (Holdings) Limited Chairman s Statement 
Similar to previous reporting periods, Asia region, which includes both manufacturing and retail activities, represented 45.5% of the Group s sales.
The US and Europe markets accounted for 27.6% and 18.7% of the Group s sales respectively. The rest of the world accounted for the remaining 8.2%.

For footwear manufacturing, the Group produced 307.1 million pairs of shoes in 2014, representing a decrease of 2.0% compared to last year. The footwear production volume was impacted mainly by the significant increase in cost structure in China and hence the Group continued optimization of its production capacity to optimize the size and geographic mix of the capacity. In addition, the Group continued to streamline the list of customers so that we could commit the Group s resources better to serve the targeted customers.

T o c o u n t e r t h e c o s t i n c r e a s e s i n f o o t w e a r manufacturing, the Group has been working closely with the brand customers and continued to invest in technologies, including automation and smart equipment control, and in production process improvement to increase manufacturing efficiency.
The Group has also been looking into ways to shorten the manufacturing lead time and to increase the level of coordination between the factory and its supply chain partners. The Group s target is not only to continue to improve manufacturing efficiency 
but also to respond more quickly to changes in customer demand. Furthermore, the Group has been working to increase the innovation and incorporation of environmentally friendly materials into footwear design, development and manufacturing.

For Pou Sheng, consumer spending in the People s Republic of China (the PRC ) improved compared to the prior years. During 2014, both international and domestic brands have been working hard to reduce the inventory in the retail channel. With the level of channel inventory down to a more normalized level, the level of discounting on prices was not as deep as compared to 2013. At the end of 2014, Pou Sheng had 4,263 directly operated storescounters and 2,689 sub-distributors in the PRC. During the year, Pou Sheng s management team maintained its focus on improving operating efficiency and keeping the store network operating primarily in the first and second tier cities. Pou Sheng management s efforts to improve the management information system and strengthen the training of retail staff helped the retail business improve its operating performance compared to that in 2013.

The Group s associated companies and joint ventures contributed a combined profit of US$78.4 million, which was an improvement compared to 2013 s profit of US$48.8 million.
