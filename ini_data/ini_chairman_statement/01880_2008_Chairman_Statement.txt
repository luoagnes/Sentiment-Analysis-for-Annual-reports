STATEMENT FROM CHAIRMAN 
Since the listing, the operations of Belle International Holdings Limited (the Company ) and its subsidiaries (collectively, referred to as the Group ) have attracted close attention from shareholders and investors in the capital market. Although all indices of the capital market experienced significant fluctuations in the second half year, the operations of the Group remained unaffected. The development of all business segments has maintained a steady growth.
The results for the year ended 31 December 2007 demonstrated that the business development objectives formulated at the beginning of the year had been achieved successfully. In 2007, 2,280 new company-managed retail outlets were opened. As at 31 December 2007, the total number of company-managed retail outlets reached 6,143. If the acquisitions of Millie s and Senda brands and operations are also considered, the Group will have over 700 additional company-managed retail outlets.
I feel very gratified that the management team has captured the development opportunities arising from various acquisitions since the listing with an enthusiastic and progressive attitude. Our team is always in high spirit and passionate about our work, which is most encouraging. Therefore, I am confident about the development of the Group and I believe the Group will have a bright future.
